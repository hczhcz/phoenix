THE EQUINE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR CONNECTION
Katlin Jayne Hornig
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, Colorado, United States

With the large amount of knowledge being attained regarding horses and alternative methods of training, there has been a surprisingly minimal amount of knowledge gathered regarding their behavior. More specifically, there has been little research done on equine behavior in relation to particular physical attributes that horses exhibit. I wanted to determine if there was any connection between a horse’s dominant leg and the behavior he exhibits. While analyzing this data, I hoped to find information that could be discovered regarding a horse’s brain and the horse’s “handedness“. I hypothesized that a horse’s leg preference would be related to certain behaviors that horses exhibit and that I would be able to deduct a possible relation to their most commonly used side of the brain, as in humans. In the process of interpreting this, I have recognized other attributes that horses exhibit and how that corresponds with their preference of leg usage and relationship to brain activity. Although there is not as high a number of similarities as I had first believed, I did discover some intriguing similarities in an equine’s physical and mental behavior. This information could prove valuable to trainers and novice equestrians in their ability to communicate with and understand their equine partner better. To test this, I requested evaluations from the horse owners in regard to their horse’s behavior. Then, I conducted testing of each horse to determine its leg preference and observed his general behavior.

THE EFFECT OF SALINITY ON FIDDLER CRAB GROWTH
Faith Elizabeth Venning
CAT/Lakewood High School - St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.A.

The most common of the fiddler crab species in the American southeast is the mangrove fiddler crab. These creatures live in a wide variety of bodies of water and salinities, and despite being of the same species and have different sizes depending on the body of water. The average growth of the crabs on the gulf coast is much higher than those that live on the Atlantic coast even though the temperatures and food supply are relatively the same. This difference in growth rate may be a factor of the salinity of the water in the crabs’ environment.<br><br>The experiment was designed to determine how the growth of Atlantic mangrove fiddler crabs is affected by the salinity of the water in their environment.<br><br> <br><br>The control group crabs were given an environment where the water was at 35ppt, about the same salinity as the Gulf of Mexico. Then, after taking all necessary precautions, a group of crabs ( 4) were put in an environment with 30ppt, one group was put an environment with 40ppt, one group in a 45ppt environment and one in a 50ppt environment. The mass of each crab was recorded daily. <br><br>The results were the complete opposite of what was hypothesized. Instead of the higher salinities have a higher growth rate, like was predicted, the subjects in the lower salinities (30 and 35ppt) had the highest rate of growth. In conclusion, the lower the salinity level, the higher the growth rate.<br><br>

DOES THE USE OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY IN THE MILK OF DAIRY COWS DETECT MASTITIS BEFORE THE COW SHOWS ANY CLINICAL SIGNS? A THREE YEAR STUDY
Joy Lynn Burnham
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, Florida, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if electrical conductivity in milk could detect mastitis before the cow shows any clinical signs. I performed this experiment because intramammary infections, or mastitis, are common in Florida because of the hot, damp climate. I hypothesized that electrical conductivity could detect mastitis before clinical signs are exhibited. <br><br> To test my hypothesis, I used data from 420 cows at the Dairy Research Unit at the University of Florida. When these cows were milked, the conductivity of their milk was tested. If their conductivity was two standard deviations above their ten day average, the number was flagged. The data was printed and sent to me weekly. When I received the data, I recorded the flagged numbers into a spreadsheet. <br><br> To analyze my data, I compared the flagged cows to cows that received treatment for mastitis. 51% of the cows that received treatment had been flagged three days prior or the day of their entrance to the treatment herd. I completed a T-Test to see if the conductivity percentages of cows that were treated were statistically higher than cows that were not treated. The cows that were treated for mastitis were statistically higher than the cows that were not treated. I also completed specificity and sensitivity calculations. Specificity was 96.7% and sensitivity was 51% <br><br> My hypothesis was proven correct. Electrical conductivity can detect mastitis before it is visible to the human eye.

"HISTOPATHOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF CARCINOGENESIS IN PLANARIANS SECONDARY TO ULTRAVIOLET A, B, & C EXPOSURE"
James Edward Fichtelman
Saint Edward's Upper School, Vero Beach, FL 32963

Sunlight’s ultraviolet radiation has long been recognized as a cause of pathologic changes in otherwise normal human skin. Also, planaria have been used in whole animal bioassays investigating carcinogens. Combining these two facts resulted in this study’s use of living planaria to evaluate the possible carcinogenic effect of ultraviolet radiation.<br><br> UVA, B, and C light were administered in set schedules of multiple sublethal doses. The response of the planaria was correlated to the degree of pigmentation of the animal by the use of black, brown, and white planaria. This was done because the degree of pigmentation of other animal models is inversely proportional to the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation.<br><br> Ultraviolet C illumination caused the most pathologic changes and subsequent mortality. Variable pathologic changes of a lesser degree were produced using UVA and UVB illumination. <br><br> The planaria with the highest melanin concentration suffered the least amount of gross and microscopic damage.<br><br> As to the question of carcinogenesis; significant, reproducible, gross and microscopic changes occurred consequent to UV radiation. Small benign tumorlets (Type I) were produced in a small percentage of planaria. A larger percentage developed progressive, malignant tumors (Type II) composed of monotonous, reticular-like cells. <br><br> Of particular interest in this study was the surface epithelial changes unrelated to Type I and II tumors. Rhabdites produced as a planarian response to radiation injury both morphologically and histochemically resemble melanosomes. The employment of planaria in both carcinogenic bioassay experiments and melanin research is strongly supported by this research.<br><br>

AUGMENTING HABITAT FOR DRYMARCHON CORAIS, A THREATENED SPECIES
David Brown Futch
Winter Haven Senior High School, Winter Haven Florida, USA

This longitudinal study sought to determine if threatened Indigo snakes or other wildlife would inhabit simulated man-made gopher tortoise burrows. It was hypothesized that Indigo snakes would inhibit man-made burrows. This original study consisted of constructing six burrows using plastic water meter boxes modified to accept 10.2 cm diameter flexible tubing, 1.8 meters in length angled to the box, and buried ½ meter below the soil surface at a nature sanctuary. On top of each box, a PVC pipe with solid or vented caps was connected for internal viewing of inhabitation of each simulated burrow. <br><br> This third year of the study investigated relative humidity and temperature both in man-made and natural burrows to replicate the conditions found in natural burrows. With the use of a data logger, temperature was recorded in both man-made and natural burrow indicating that the solid capped burrows maintained a temperature of 26.5ºC. The temperature study demonstrated a similar temperature between the solid capped burrow and the natural burrow throughout the hottest months would make these burrows desirable for inhabitation of wildlife. Relative humidity was also measured to establish a comparison between the natural burrow, man-made burrow and the outside humidity. The results of this study indicated that the simulated burrows with solid caps maintaining a relative humidity inside the box about 97%, which closely aligned to the relative humidity and temperature found in the natural burrows and the simulated burrows were being inhibited by Indigo snakes, opossums, rats and other small animals. <br><br>

GRADED FOOD RECRUITMENT IN APHAENOGASTER OCCIDENTALIS
Sebastian Luke Scofield
Home educated, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether ants of the species Aphaenogaster occidentalis use a graded recruitment system and, if so, how it is implemented. Last year, I did an experiment on which foods A. occidentalis preferred, and this led me to wonder how A. occidentalis workers recruit other workers to food sites and if they employ a graded food recruitment system.<br><br> The experiments involved measuring foraging activity in relation to the scouts’ contact with other workers in the nest. This was done by placing the food sample in the foraging area of the ant colony kept in the lab. The number of ants at the food sample, the number of ants in the foraging area not at the food sample, the number of ants that returned to the nest after finding the food sample, and the number of ants that carried the food sample back to the nest were observed and recorded at intervals of 5 minutes for 1 hour, or until the food sample was brought into the nest.<br><br> Aphaenogaster occidentalis ants were found to use a graded recruitment system to increase their colony's response to richer food sources, which they implement by means of pheromone trails. The results further show that ants of the species A. occidentalis are solitary foragers on small insect prey, but, when large prey items are discovered, they lay pheromone trails, using rapid group retrieval to quickly bring the prey back to the nest.<br><br>

MATERNAL EFFECTS OF DIET RESTRICTION IN FRUIT FLIES
Yihe Dong
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, Georgia, U.S.A.

Diet restriction (DR) has been shown to increase longevity and stress resistance in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. It is hypothesized that the DR fly progenies are more stress resistant and live longer than control regular diet (R) progenies. This study could show how the parents’ environment can induce changes in their offspring’s health.<br><br>The study began with expanding the Drosophila population, half of which was exposed to DR conditions while the other half to standard diet for 20 days. Afterwards, males and females were transferred to regular diet bottles to mate and lay eggs. Then 3200 virgin offspring were collected and placed into single-sex regular diet cages. When the offspring were five-day-old, starvation and oxidative stress resistance was tested in both sexes. Stress resistance was determined by checking mortality every two hours for 186 consecutive hours. Fly longevity is determined by checking fly mortality every three days until all flies die.<br><br>The results of Kaplan-Meier estimate and log-rank tests confirmed the hypothesis, showing a significant difference between DR and R progenies for both females (p=0.0024) and males (p=0.0001) in oxidative stress resistance; and females (p=0.0006) but not males (p=0.2516) in starvation resistance, hinting it is sex-specific in starvation. All control groups showed low mortality. In the longevity experiment, DR progenies showed lower longevity than R diet progenies in both males and females; which may be explained with the Y-model of energy trade-off. Maternal effects could be explained with epigenetics, non-Mendelian inheritance, and maternal genes expression. Progeny fecundity can be measured to determine the effects of DR on offspring fitness.

AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY ON HOW ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AFFECT DAPHNIA MAGNA
Melissa Danielle Lewis
Eastern High School, Pekin, Indiana, Us

An electromagnetic field (EMF) is a force of invisible lines that surrounds an electrical device or wire. Daphnia magna are small crustacean animals that range in size from .2 and 5 mm in length. The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of electromagnetic fields on Daphnia magna. It was hypothesized if Daphnia magna were contained within an electromagnetic field, then there would be a negative effect on the Daphnia. Fish tanks, screens, an electric alarm clock and quart mason jars were purchased at Wal-Mart and an EMF detector was purchased from www.lessemf.com. Daphnia magna were purchased from Carolina Biological. Tanks were established using spring water and boiled egg yolk. The alarm clock was connected to a series of extension cords and wrapped around the experimental tank to create an electromagnetic field (EMF), the control tank did not have any coils wrapped around it. Both tanks contained thermometers to insure proper water temperature and were placed in the same room with the same amount of sunlight. The EMF was measured within and surrounding the tanks. Daphnia magna were placed on well slides and were observed using a swift M3500D microscope at 4x power. Their heart rates in beats per minute were calculated to determine stress levels, and compared to the heart rate of the Daphnia in the control tank. Average heart rates were not significant (p=0.22) using Student’s t-test. However, mortality rates were found to be highly significant (p=.001) when individual containers were established to determine the LD50. <br><br>

CHICKEN EMBRYO GROWTH AFTER EXPOSURE TO MMT, A FUEL ADDITIVE
Tess Linnea Peterson
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville FL, USA

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of exposure to Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) on the growth of chicken embryos. MMT is a fuel additive used to prevent the premature ignition of fuel in an internal combustion engine known as knocking. The manganese in MMT neutralizes the alkyl radicals formed when fuel decomposes that cause knocking. Manganese is an essential trace element. <br><br>Fifty control eggs and 50 experimental eggs were put into the incubator in separate trays where they remained for 120 hours to allow initial growth. A 0.01% solution of MMT, the concentration found in gasoline, was mixed in ethanol. The experimental eggs were submerged in the MMT solution then placed back into the incubator. The control eggs were submerged in pure ethanol then placed back into the incubator. The eggs remained in the incubator for 10 days. The eggs were frozen at -3°C for 48 hours then thawed for 24 hours. Each egg was cracked open and the length of the embryo was from the tip of its beak to the bottom of its torso. The control embryos had an average growth of 6.9 cm, and the embryos exposed to MMT had an average growth of 6.5 cm. The embryos exposed to MMT had 5.8% less growth in the first trial and 7.5% less growth in the second trial. Using a t-test, the difference in growth was proven to be statistically significant. Because MMT has proven to have toxic effects on chicken embryos, further studies should be conducted to further understand the toxic effects of MMT on other organisms, such as humans, before the use of MMT becomes more prevalent.<br><br>

DOES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HAEMONCHUS CONTORTUS AFFECT PARASITE BURDEN, PACKED CELL VOLUME, AND SERUM IGA LEVELS IN OVIS ARIES DURING GESTATION?
Joshua Clay McCann
Giles High School, Pearsiburg, VA, United States

Most sheep breeds are highly susceptible to internal parasites which can damage gastrointestinal tissues or even kill the animal. Drugs used to control internal parasites, anthelmintics, are administered to optimize health and performance of the animal. With increased anthelmintic resistance, a predisposition to parasite resistance would be economically advantageous in commercial sheep. Previous work indicated that Caribbean hair sheep are more resistant to the most detrimental parasite, Haemonchus contortus, but defense mechanisms are unclear. This study investigated how serum IgA levels were affected during gestation in hair (n=10) and wool sheep (n=10). All ewes were previously infected with 10,000 third stage Haemonchus contortus larvae. Fecal eggs counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) were monitored on each individual during the five week trial. Results from the multivariate analysis of variance indicated no difference in FEC during any week after infection. Both groups had increased FEC during the experiment, thus neither elicited a sufficient immune response to control parasite infection. Wool sheep had higher PCV (P<0.05) four weeks after infection suggesting less negative effects due to worm burden. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine total IgA levels in the serum during the experiment. Results showed a significant breed effect (P<0.05) on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 21, and 28 after previous infection with the hair sheep having higher levels at each significant day. Both groups elicited an immune response that peaked initially at day 5. Currently, a Haemonchus contortus-specific IgA ELISA is being conducted. Upon completion, the immune response can be more clearly discerned in both groups. With increased knowledge about immunological differences between hair and wool sheep, genetic mechanisms that determine resistance to Haemonchus contortus may be used to design vaccines and select for parasite resistance.

COLORED LIGHT AND THE NOCTURNAL HUNTER
Lucia Calderon-Arrieta
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL, United States of America

The purpose was to ascertain if the hunting time of a primarily nocturnal hunter, the Florida Brown & Yellow Wolf Spider (Lycosa Miami), is affected by the color of light it hunts in. Crickets were chosen as prey because they were the correct size relative to the spider, and are easily attainable. My hypothesis was that the colored light would affect the spiders’ hunt time; being nocturnal, it would be least in dim light.<br><br>Before the experiment, gather materials, prepare “homes”, purchase crickets, and set up the test site. The test begins with the cricket and spider on opposite sides of the enclosure. Turn on the light (if appropriate), shift the partition out of the enclosure, and start the timer. Observe, noting anything of interest and the spider’s catch time. <br><br>Data supports the hypothesis, numerically. More interesting is the lack of active hunting by the spiders. Sources describe wolf spiders as “either running down their prey or pouncing” (Bohart Museum.) In dim light, there was no active hunting, versus two instances in green light (spiders 5 and 9). This, despite that green light had the highest average catch time and only 4 crickets of 12 were caught. Only spider 3 stalked in the white light trial. The cold weather coupled with their disorientation was probably the cause of the spiders’ contradictory performance. They were ordered from Florida, where December weather was at least 5 degrees higher than in Mobile. Disorientation means the spider had no indicator to orient itself from.<br><br>

IS MASS MEDICATION OF HIGH-RISK UNWEANED, CO-MINGLED, EASTERN U.S. CATTLE JUSTIFIED?
Lacey Jayne Newlin
Burlington High School, Burlington, Oklahoma, USA

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) or shipping fever is a respiratory disease complex of enormous significance to stocker operators, feed lots, and other beef industry operations where cattle are in high stress situations. Pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars each year in research and in advertising to control the (BRD) problem. The problem that feed lots face is whether or not mass medication is justified by lower mortality rates, morbidity rates, and is it economical. My hypothesis was that mass medication of high-risk, unweaned, co-mingled Eastern U.S. cattle originating from various sale barns would be justified by lower mortality rates and lower morbidity rates. 108 high-risk, unweaned, co-mingled heifers averaging 545 pounds were randomly placed into three study groups at a NW Oklahoma preconditioning lot while data was collected for 33 days. This study compared mass medication treatment on arrival of cattle with Nuflor, Tetradure, or no mass medication. The study compared cost per head, mortality rates, morbidity rates and feed consumption rates. The study found that at this preconditioning lot, this time of year mass medication was not justified and the control group exhibited the highest feed consumption. Continued research is needed to access the conditions in which mass medication is justified.

THE EFFECTS OF CELL PHONE RADIATION ON SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS OF DROSOPHILA
Jonathan James Hill
Texico High School Texico, New Mexico USA

Our society and world uses cell phones every day, a habit that was not common to humans merely 20 yers ago. Children and adults alike are using these devices for many hours. The problem is that cell phones are known to emit electromagnetic radiation. Only time will tell if years of cellular phone usage will biologically effect human organisms, including changes in intracellullar ionic concentrations, the synthesis rate of different biomolecules, cell proliferation rates, and ultimately, reproductive capacities.<br><br> Condsidering the atomic bomb the US released on Japan, its catastrophic effects and the way it still affects the offspring of those who lived through it, it is apparent that 64 years of radiation has biologically altered a portion of the human race. Of course that example involved a lot more radiaition than cell phones release, but it must be taken into account that over years of daily use, cell phone radiation exposure will accumulate as we have yet to see. Our subsequent generations could experience some biological difficulties related to the vast exposure of cell phone radiation in their ancestors. <br><br> This experiment revealed that the first, second, and third generations of Drosophila that were radiated had no changes in eye color from the control group or the previous generation. Eye color never varied in any of hte Drosophila tested. <br><br> However, changes in size were noted, though they were subtle and inconsistent. More notable were the changes in the development and growth of wing structure, and even leg mutations. <br><br> Vulnerabilities to the DNA and eggs of this species will not directly equal that of humans, but it is intended that this project will address the issues and hand and lend insight about exposure to radiation.

DETERMINING COLOR PREFERENCE FOR EGG - LAYING IN MILKWEED INSECTS
Kari Abraham Jackson
Benjamin E. Mays High School, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

One serious problem facing farmers is destruction of crops by members of the insect order Hemiptera. These insects are pests to a variety of crops, and there is currently no effective way to control their population or inhibit their reproduction. In this experiment, however, it was hypothesized that these insects might have a color preference for where they choose to lay their eggs. If such a preference exists, it could potentially be exploited to limit reproduction. In this experiment, twenty large milkweed insects were placed in a plastic arena with access to green, yellow, red, and blue pieces of cotton on which to lay eggs. Milkweed insects were chosen as subjects because while they are not plant pests, they have many characteristics in common with insects that are, including similar “tastes” for plants. The number of eggs that the milkweed insects laid on each color of cotton was monitored daily for ten days, and they appeared to prefer yellow and green. They laid an average of 149 eggs on these colors, while they laid an average of 100 on blue and red. Insects also appeared to have a directional preference, as they laid the most eggs in the northeast corner of the plastic arena. Future experimentation might explore the reasons for these preferences and their possible application to agricultural techniques.

VULNERABILITY OF NEWBORN FRESHWATER PORPOISE IN CHINA'S YANGTZE RIVER
Wanyi Zhang
No.1 Middle School Attached to Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China

The Yangtze finless porpoise is an endangered freshwater porpoise which is endemic to China's Yangtze River. The high mortality among newborns is a concern for scientists trying to conserve the species. The aim of this study was to determine and understand the factors that reduce newborns chances of survival and use this information to aid the development of an effective conservation strategy for the species. <br><br>To begin understanding this process, I observed social behaviors and the development of echolocation of a newborn in captivity. Changes in the calf's breathing rate and proximity to its mother were monitored when the individual was played ship traffic noise recordings. <br><br>The mother-calf distance was 0-40cm in the first month and gradually increased to 105cm in the fifth month. The frequency of mother-calf eye contact was 133-84 times/hr in the first month and gradually decreased to 57 times/hr in the fifth month. No exploratory behavior was observed until the 21st day and no echolocation was recorded until the 27th day. When the calf was exposed to ship traffic noise its breathing rate and distance from its mother increased by 79.2% and 392.1% respectively.<br><br>My data suggest that the first month for a calf is the most vulnerable period. Given the calf's physical reaction to the recordings, I can infer that ship traffic noise has the potential to adversely separate the calf from its mother during the period. A future conservation strategy should consider trying to reduce ship traffic noise in the porpoise nursery grounds.

DISPERSAL PATTERNS OF RELOCATED THREE-TOED BOX TURTLES (TERRAPENE CAROLINA TRIUNGUIS)
Alex Brendan Heeb
Heeb Homeschool, Chaffee, Missouri 63740

Much evidence shows declines in populations of three-toed box turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis), a terrestrial species whose range includes Southeast Missouri. Relocation of turtles has been considered for stabilizing declining populations and for reestablishing extirpated ones.<br><br> This study, the first to examine movement in box turtles relocated from different distances and habitats, was conducted at two large wooded areas of 56 and 179 hectares in Scott County, Missouri. I compared movements of a group of resident turtles and three groups of relocated turtles. Movements were recorded by radio telemetry or incidental capture. The relocated turtles were collected from turtle races in Oran (6 km. S. from point of release), New Hamburg (6 km. ESE), and Washington (200 km. NW). <br><br> On average, turtles collected at Washington traveled twice as far as the relocated turtles from Oran and New Hamburg (statistically significant). Resident turtles moved considerably less than relocated turtles (statistically significant).<br><br> The resident turtles have home ranges of a few hectares. Some relocated turtles showed signs of home range establishment, but most wandered in a certain direction and continued in that direction until brumation. <br><br> Both Washington and Oran turtles appeared to show some non-random directional movements. No homing movement was detected in relocated turtles.<br><br> Results suggest that relocation must be done carefully to prevent turtles from leaving the site or crossing hazards. While relocation may be useful for reestablishing extirpated populations, it is likely that other measures to preserve existing populations would be more effective than supplementing them with relocated turtles.

TROPHOTAXIS BEHAVIORS OF HIRUDO NIPPONIA AND THEIR USE IN SELECTING VEGETAL REPELLENTS
Li-Yan Xie
The First Senior Middle School of Loudi,Loudi 417000 Hunan China

<br><br> The Japanese leech Hirudo nipponia is an invertebrate species living in paddyfields; its development and reproduction depend on biting human and domestic animals and sucking their blood, and it is thus responsible for the spreading of many human and animal<br><br>diseases. The study focused on its behavior ecology; trophotaxis reactions to different plant macerating solutions were observed so that to find out the best repellent against Hirudo nipponi. The study also found that water wave, animal body temperature and blood smell exhibited obvious attraction to Hirudo nipponia, but sound itself did not. For different plant macerating solutions, Camellia oleifera, Allium satioum,Polygonum flaccidum, and Nicotiana tabacum (leaf and stalk) were selected and tested. Camellia oleifera and Nicotiana tabacum (leaf and stalk) were proved to be best candidates as repellents against Hirudo nipponia. They are economical,practical and environment friendly.

AGONISM BETWEEN TWO EPIBENTHIC FRESHWATER DECAPODS
Alexander Mee-Woong Kim
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Fairfax, Virginia, USA

Agonism and shelter competition between red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii Girard) and bigclaw river prawns (Macrobrachium carcinus Linnaeus) were examined under captive conditions. Experimentation, in two segments, aimed to define interspecies trends of competitive and behavioral dominance. Segment I established for both species a baseline of shelter usage under noncompetitive conditions. Segment II entailed allowing two specimens, one of each species, to compete for possession of a single shelter. The organisms in such pairings were placed on opposite sides of a divided aquarium to acclimate prior to removal of the barrier and allowance of interaction. In addition to shelter occupancy exchanges, the outcomes of all agonistic incidents during the experimental phase were recorded, as were the frequencies of certain behavioral sequences: meral spread, chela wave, chela grasp, lunge, slow retreat, and rapid retreat. M. carcinus was found to exhibit a significant overall advantage over P. clarkii in terms both of agonistic victory and of shelter retention (as compared against the expected occupancy established in Segment I). These data suggest that M. carcinus may be capable both of resisting P. clarkii invasion in its native range and precipitating faunal displacements as an introduced species elsewhere, with notable implications for the aquaculture of both species.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF A COMMON CORN CRIMINAL PHASE 4: A FOUR YEAR STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF HETERORHABDITIS NEMATODES ON THE CARPOPHILUS, LUGUBRIS DUSKY SAP BEETLE
DJ Ray Horton
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss Colorado, USA

The aim of this project has been to develop a practical application for applying nematodes as a biological pest control to a crop. Phase 4 of this project aimed to test the “T” trap, a biological control aid, in two field test situations. <br><br>In experiment 1, colonies of five hundred, second-generation, laboratory-reared sap beetles were placed in traps in a simulated cornfield environment. A separate group of five hundred beetles was then exposed to nematodes and released into the experimental area. After a six-day period the number of dead beetles in the colonies was counted. <br><br>It was found that the mean number of dead beetles in the experimental group was 593 higher than the control group. These results supported the hypothesis that that a small number of nematode-infected sap beetles could result in a mass colony infection.<br><br>In experiment 2 local sweet corn plots were chosen at random to be either an experimental site or a control site. One modified trap was placed at each site before and after experimentation. A count was taken of the number of beetles in each trap. This count served as an estimate for the beetle population in each field before and after experimentation. Experimentation consisted of placing “T” traps containing nematodes in the fields. <br><br>The “T” trap decreased beetle population in the fields by almost 97 percent, or 4311 beetles, on average, which supported the hypothesis that nematodes in “T” traps can control sap beetle populations.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF IMIDACLOPRID RESISTANCE ON THE IMMUNOCOMPETENCE OF LEPTINOTARSA DECEMLINEATA
Bushra Wazed
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing New York, United States of America

The current study examined immunocompetence of resistant and susceptible Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to determine whether immunity is a cost of imidacloprid resistance. Immunity was assessed in two different ways: resistance to Beauveria bassiana and encapsulation response. Resistant larvae had higher mortality when exposed to B. bassiana. The significant mortality data analyzed by the Likelihood Ratio Test (p=0.0208) and Wilcoxon Test (p=0.0031) indicate that resistant beetles have a weaker immunity. Analysis of the encapsulation response by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests provided contradictory but nonsignificant results (p1=0.1391, p2=0.0735). There was no significant difference in the encapsulation response between resistant and susceptible Colorado potato beetles. The methodology used in the encapsulation test calls into question those results and requires that this experiment be repeated to resolve the difference.

SEX DETERMINATION OF SAROTHERODON BY OFFSPRING RATIO, MASS, AND LENGTH; YEAR THREE
Gabriel Heath Miller
Lefors High School, Lefors, Texas, United States of America

<br><br>Sarotherodon (Tilapia) are one of the largest cultivated aquatic species. Researchers and producers face problems when sexing Tilapia; manually sexing may present stress to the fish when proper precedures are not followed. This project is an experimentation to determine a less stressful form of sexing Tilapia by use of offspring ratio, mass, and length. After researching Sarotherodon reproduction and growth patterns, I hypothesized that the male to female ratio would be 1:1, and male Tilapia would have a greater mass and length than female.<br><br> <br><br>Two tanks were divided into four sections in set-up. Four hundred Tilapia were used with 200 in each half of the project. Each tank division housed 25 Tilapia, which were fed three times daily, with water added to keep tank levels equal. Observations were made daily. At maturity, the Tilapia were identified as male or female. For the next month, the fish remained undisturbed except weighing and measuring weekly. The fish were then moved to a new section for later comparison. This was repeated two times. <br><br> <br><br>Out of 200 fry, the male to female ratio was 12:13. Male Tilapia outgrew female Tilapia an average of 52.4 percent in mass, and 36.8 percent in length. <br><br> <br><br>This project finds a less stressful method of sexing Tilapia. During sexing, males are generally larger in mass and length when compared to female. Offspring ratio is an ineffective technique of sexing Tilapia. Usage of mass and length comparison is not only less stressful, but also increases profit for producers and test subjects for researchers.<br><br>

HOW OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AFFECTS THE SURVIVAL RATE AND SHELL MASS OF SITKA PERIWINKLES (LITTORINA SITKANA)
Jurgen Mitchell Rieselbach
Juneau-Douglas High School. Juneau, AK, USA

Increases in atmospheric CO2 over the next century are predicted to cause significant reductions in ocean pH. This will change the solubility of calcium carbonate in seawater, a cause of concern because animals with calcium carbonate-based skeletons constitute a vital part of marine ecosystems. Currently, little is known about the sensitivity of marine invertebrates to changes in ambient pH. <br><br> The sensitivity of Sitka periwinkles to decreasing pH was examined by measuring their mortality rates after exposure to different pH levels for 24 or 48 hours. The effects of decreasing pH on shell mass was determined by soaking large and small shells in seawater with different pH levels for 7 days and recording the mass loss. <br><br>The 24-hour assay resulted in an exponential relationship with a statistically significant increase (P < 0.0001) in mortality around a pH of 6.0. For the 48-hour assay, there was a similar relationship though not statistically significant, likely due to a smaller range of pHs assessed. There was an inverse linear relationship between pH and mass loss for both shell sizes and pH (r^2 > 0.8296). Significant reductions of small shell mass occurred at pH < 6.0, while mass losses in large shells were not statistically significant despite a similar trend. <br><br>Ocean pH is projected to decline by 0.5 units from the current global average of 8.1 this century. My project indicates that intertidal mollusks are sensitive to pH changes. Pending decreases are likely to have dramatic effects on the structure of intertidal communities.

INTEGRATING HIRUDIN FROM HIRUDO MEDICINALIS INTO AN ANTICOAGULATIVE MEDICATION FOR EQUUS CABALLUS; PHASE I COLLECTION AND PURIFICATION
Alexandra Leigh McIe
Brewster High School, Brewster New York, USA

The protein hirudin acts as an anticoagulant and mild anesthetic. It is secreted in the saliva of Hirudo medicinalis, the medicinal leech, while feeding to act as a thrombin inhibitor in its prey. Although already commonly used for humans, this study investigates the possibilities of hirudin's pharmaceutical usages for Equus caballus, the domestic horse. Four specific areas of the study have been outlined; collection of the hirudin sample, purification, mass production, and delivery method to Equus caballus. The first two were the main focus of this phase of the study. A saliva sample was successfully taken from the medicinal leech. The protein within it was then purified through column and thin layer chromatography. Beaded and powdered silica gel and sol-gel were compared for effectiveness as the column. Also tested were silica gel, alumina and paper chromatography plates, as well as two different solvents; ethanol and methanol. Results from the thin layer chromatography confirm the extent to which the column purified the sample by showing the ranges of mass and density in the remaining particles. Through this system, a sol-gel column was the most effective purifier, and silica gel chromatography plates provided the clearest means by which to visualize results. There was no significant difference between solvents. Plans for future research include plasmid transformations into multiple strains of E. coli, and testing a method by which to administer the medication. Possible methods have already been designed for trial.

CLASSIFICATION AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF SHIELD SHRIMP (NOTOSTRACA: LEPIDURUS SP.) IN PLAYA LAKES OF THE CENTRAL GREAT BASIN
Jed Wade Bradley
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek Nevada, U.S.A

The purpose of this study was to classify and learn about a small crustacean living in playa lakes in Northern Nevada. These crustaceans are commonly known as shield shrimp. When I was informed of these critters I gained immediate interest. I wasn’t able to find very much information about the species, especially inhabiting this geographical area. It caused me to believe that I might have been working with a new species or subspecies, or five new species for that matter. I decided that I wanted to perform morphological comparisons and possibly DNA comparisons on the organism. This led me to the idea of studying the biogeography of the species (to work with geographic isolation leading to possible evolution.) I used a scientific collection permit to collect shield shrimp from five different playa lakes in Northern Nevada, specifically Elko, Eureka, and White Pine counties. I took the specimens home and performed various measurements and extensive research on the topic. I compared my measurements and other information to those in research I had compiled. Due to what I believe is a significant amount of evidence, I classified the species as (Lepidurus lemmoni.) Unofficially, I believe I have been the first scientist to document this species in Northern Nevada. This research has succeeded in describing the biogeography of Notostraca in an area of the Great Basin, largely unknown to science. I have also preserved all specimens in hopes of sequencing their DNA to prove or disprove my findings.

STUDIES ON SOUSA CHINENSIS POPULATION IN SANNIANGWAN, GUANGXI PROVINCE PRIMARY ANALYSIS OF POPULATION SIZE AND AGE STRUCTURE
Kai-Jun Lu
Beijing NO.5 High School, Beijing, China

Chinese White Dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a rare and endangered species in China. Recently, public attentions have been raised more and more and studies are conducted on the protection of this animal all over the world. Nevertheless, few studies have been focused on the investigation of its population size. In my study a new method has been developed: the analogous mark-recapture (AMR) method. With this I investigated the natural population size and age structure in the studied area, namely in the sea of San Niang Wan (108 37 55 -108 51 49 E, 21 28 36 -21 41 16 N), Guang Xi Province, South China. I also used the direct-count method for small groups. During the 30-day field observations (in January 2006, February 2006, April 2006 and August 2006), 8948 photos of S. chinensis were taken which formed the basis for the following analyses. Of all the photos, 1572 were selected as valuable and used in AMR analyses. Some special body characteristics detected by the photos were effective in distinguishing individuals of different ages or stages of development; there included body color, dorsal fin shape, dorsal edge pattern of head, and caudal fin shape. Based on these, I attribute successfully recognized 43 different dolphin individuals. Meanwhile, the population sizes in summer, winter, and spring were estimated based on the AMR method. The results showed that 124 Chinese White Dolphins live in the area, of which 36.5 % may be adults. Furthermore, the dolphins¡¯ inbreeding rate is estimated to be 1.09 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hand written formulas<br><br>

THE ROLE OF TBX5 IN CHICK FORELIMB DEVELOPMENT
Tessa Grace Montague
The Camden School for Girls, London, United Kingdom

The gene Tbx5 codes for a transcription factor essential for the development of the forelimb in vertebrates. Mutations in human TBX5 are associated with Holt-Oram Syndrome – a disorder characterised by limb and heart malformations. The aim of this study was to analyse the function of Tbx5 and how mutations in TBX5 cause the limb abnormalities found in Holt-Oram Syndrome.<br><br>I undertook a gene misexpression strategy in my experiments using the chick embryo as an experimental model system. Avian retroviruses can be engineered to carry a gene of interest and the resulting viral particles can be used to infect cells of the limb. This causes targeted ectopic expression of a chosen gene. I misexpressed a truncated form of Tbx5 (Tbx5Ä) that is predicted to disrupt the function of the endogenous protein in the limb bud of chick embryos. At a later stage of development the muscle morphology of injected forelimbs were compared with wild-type control forelimbs. Whole Mount Immunohistochemistry was used to characterise the phenotypes, and the results were analysed with Optical Projection Tomography (OPT). OPT produces 3D datasets of specimen without physical sectioning.<br><br>The results of my experiments show that the injection of Tbx5Ä causes a disruption in the muscle patterning of the forelimb. There appear to be fewer muscle bundles and no muscle formation in the distal region of the mutated forelimb. This suggests that downstream targets of Tbx5 play a role in the muscle formation of the forelimb.<br><br>

THE DETERMINATION OF GENDER IN PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC SALMON FOR IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF THREATENED AND ENDANGERED STOCKS
Susannah Lee Clary
Los Lunas High School, Los Lunas, New Mexico, USA

Purpose: To determine if there are morphological characteristics of Pacific Chinook, Pacific Coho and Atlantic salmon which can be used in the field to determine gender without harming them.<br><br>Hypothesis: It is possible to determine the gender of Pacific and Atlantic salmon with morphological characteristics.<br><br>Procedures: The data in this study were obtained from salmon raised in aquaculture operations in British Columbia during routine management procedures. Measurements of head length, total length, fork length and body length were obtained from 800 salmon. <br><br>Methods: The means, standard deviations and standard errors of the head length to body length ratio (H.L. / B.L.) for each species were calculated using MS Excel. The two-sample t-Test was used to calculate the probabilities of significance. Graphs were generated with OriginPro 7.5 software.<br><br>Results: The ratio of head length to body length between the gender classes and all age groups is significantly different. The t-Test analysis of this ratio yielded a p < 0.0001 that the differences were a result of chance. Field identification cards for each species were prepared.<br><br>Conclusions: My hypothesis was correct. The head length to body length ratio can be used to determine the gender of Chinook, Coho and Atlantic salmon. Because of research from this study, fisheries biologists can now modify their population models relative to the dynamics of individual populations (stocks) and more accurately predict the number of harvestable fish and salmon-escapements. This will permit a more accurate assessment of the endangered and threatened stocks of Pacific and Atlantic salmon in North America.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS: DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCE OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: PHASE III
Zoe Elizabeth Teague
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro Arkansas, United States

Previously, experiments were conducted to determine the preference of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) for sweeteners. It was determined that they prefer 10% W/V aqueous solutions of sucrose or aspartame as opposed to 10% W/V aqueous solutions of sucralose or saccharin. This continuation study investigated whether a higher population density of flies in differing volumes of feeding chambers would alter the preference for the available sweeteners. Sucrose and sucralose (10% W/V) were dyed with red and blue food coloring respectively and presented to the flies on saturated 1 cm3 sections of floral foam in order to determine the sweetener preference of the fruit flies. This was accomplished by counting their dyed fecal specks on filter paper after 15 hours of exposure to the sweetener in a room set at 82ºF (27.78ºC) and 65% relative humidity. In previous studies, 7-10 flies were aspirated into a two-sectioned petri dish and were provided with a choice of a dyed test substance. This study placed 50 flies in the following volumes of feeding chambers: Petri dish; 0.4 L beaker; 3.75 L jar and a 16 L pot. The bottom of each vessel was covered with filter paper and the sweeteners were places on plastic coasters at opposite sides of the chamber. The dyed fecal specks (red, blue, or purple) were counted to determine preferences under increased numbers and space. The flies showed no change in preference under the increased pressure of larger population densities in the varying sized chambers. The flies still preferred the 10% solution of sucrose in all cases when compared with sucralose.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DIET, GUT FLORA, AND EQUINE LAMINITS: A PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY
Annemarie Chikondi Thomas
Dominion High School, Sterling, Virginia, United States of America

Laminitis is an ailment in equines that causes the tissue connecting the pedal bone and inner hoof wall to deteriorate. When this happens the pedal bone can sink through the hoof. Barbaro, the famous late racehorse, developed acute laminitis after shattering multiple bones in a race and undergoing multiple surgeries. Carbohydrate overload may play a role in the development of laminitis. The purpose of this research was to study glucose levels in common grass and hay to determine the better feeding regimens for horses to perhaps deter the development of laminitis. Two different types of grass were cultivated. Samples of grass were blended and added to cultures containing E. coli, gastric juice, and a combination of both. Glucose levels were determined using anthrone analysis in both fresh and frozen samples, which were allowed to incubate for 4 and 24 hours. Statistical analysis via a t-test showed there was a significant difference in the amount of glucose released in four testing situations. In the E. coli samples, frozen white clover released much less glucose than frozen bluegrass. In the E. coli and gastric juice samples, frozen white clover grass released much less glucose than alfalfa hay, frozen bluegrass and unfrozen white clover. This research can help provide information to assist in protecting horses from developing laminitis and offer insight into the treatment of laminitis.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRICITY ON PARALYZED WORMS
Mustafa Mohammed Iqbal
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio,TX, USA

The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the effect of electricity on healing in nerve-damaged earthworms. The hypothesis was that applying electric current to an injury will speed recovery. In this experiment earthworms were separated into four groups of thirty worms. The worms in two groups had their ventral nerve chords severed at the approximate mid-point of the worm by means of an incision on the ventral side. <br><br>One of these two incised groups received an electric current (7.2 V, 0.0169 Amps) at the time of wounding; the other was left to heal without the application of an electric current. <br><br>A third group received only the electric current and the control group received neither injury nor electricity.<br><br> <br><br>The motor capabilities of all worms were measured once a day over four days, the first observation being taken immediately after treatment. Each worm was tapped on the anterior end to determine if the entire length of the worm responded. A second method used was to place the worms individually on a platform under a strong light, observing the time it took for each worm to crawl off of the platform.<br><br>Electricity alone had no effect on the movements of uninjured worms. All incised worms suffered a loss in motor abilities subsequent to wounding. Treatment with electric current significantly (p<0.05) speeded recovery times of injured worms relative to those injured worms which did not receive electricity. In conclusion, the results supported the hypothesis that electricity does help nerve-damaged worms recover faster. <br><br><br>

NATURAL MOSQUITO PESTICIDES; PLANT EXTRACTS AS A SAFER ALTERNATIVE ON NON-TARGET SPECIES, YEAR V
Taylor Paige Wood
Sam Houston High School, Lake Charles, Louisiana, USA

Mosquitoes develop a resistance to currently used pesticides. This stresses the need to research and develop new methods of treatment that are environmentally safe and target specific. The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of extract derived from two insect repellent plants; Mexican Marigold and Lemon Grass, as a natural mosquito pesticide alternative on three non-target mosquito predators.<br><br> The first steps in the experiment were to develop the test sample extracts. Leaves from each plant were cut and weighed into 1, 3, and 5 grams. The leaves were then washed, diced up thoroughly, and 30 milliliters of bottled water were added to each sample. The samples were filtered into separate containers, covered, labeled, and allowed to sit for 24 hours, then filtered again. Afterwards, each sample was placed into labeled spray bottles. Eight of each specimen; damselfly, dragonfly, and wolf spider, were placed into individ-<br><br>ual labeled rearing cages, two used as the controls for each plant type, three for each gram sample of Mexican Marigold, and three for each gram sample of Lemon Grass. Specimens were then sprayed three times with sample extracts every twelve hours during the forty-eight hour exposure time.<br><br> The data recorded revealed that the 1 gram concentration of Mexican Marigold and the 1 and 3 gram concentration of Lemon Grass had no adverse affects on the specimen. The benefits of using these plants may provide a natural source for mosquito control along with it being an environmentally safer alternative.

AN EVALUATION OF THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE BEHAVIORS OF A LITTER OF WEANED PIGS WHEN EXPOSED TO NO TOYS, A FREE TOY AND A SUSPENDED TOY.
Sarah Louise Cordova
Kings Park High School, Kings Park, New York, USA

<br><br>The current living conditions of domestic pigs are widely found to be dark and constricting and this type of environment has been found in past research to have a detrimental effect on their behavior. Pigs are highly intelligent and social creatures who exhibit a wide range of behaviors. Thus the purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of different types of toys, (a suspended toy, a free toy) and no toys at all on the negative and positive behaviors displayed by pigs. Typical negative pig behavior is associated with ear biting, shrieking, eating alone, and bar biting because they indicate aggression and boredom. Positive behaviors are associated with nuzzling, running and chasing, eating in groups, back jumping, and grunting. The pigs were observed under the control condition (no toy) and the two toy conditions (suspended and free) and these behaviors were observed and recorded. It was found that the positive behaviors were exhibited in the highest degree under the toy conditions, particularly the free toy condition and the negative behaviors were shown in the lowest degree under that same condition The control condition showed the opposite, with the highest degree of negative behaviors and the lowest degree of positive behaviors. The results of this study indicate that domestic pigs in captivity would benefit from the addition of toys to their pen. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE STATUS OF ADULT FEMALE MICE ON COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE DURING THE POSTPARTUM WEEKS
Sonika Tyagi
William Dickinson High School, Jersey City, NJ, United States of America 

Enhanced or positively altered cognition may cause survival-enhancing behavioral modifications in the mammalian progenitor (Kinsley et al., 2005). This project sought to ascertain whether significant differences in cognitive and behavioral performances exist between primiparous and age-matched virgin female domestic mice during the late postpartum weeks. <br><br> The 1st experiment initiated on postpartum day 4 and tested reference memory after lengthy time intervals through an object recognition task. Testing on reference memory of late postpartum weeks began on postpartum day 38 as the mice recollected the locations of baits during 4 perceptual stimuli-specific test phases. From postpartum days 69-78, reference and working memories were tested compositely as errors made in retrieving baits from the 10-arm radial maze were recorded. Boldness was assessed using the fear-evoking open arms of the elevated plus maze from postpartum days 79 to 88. <br><br> The null hypotheses for all experiments were rejected. The primiparous mice displayed enhanced reference and working memories and more boldness in the late postpartum weeks, suggesting that primiparity and its effects on cognition are long-lasting, and contributing to the improved quality of care portrayed by nonhuman mammalian mothers towards subsequent offspring. Fluctuating reproductive hormones of postpartum are noted to enlarge neuronal cell bodies, and encourage synapse formation in brain regions involved in maternal responses. Offspring are also factors responsible for reinforcing maternal behavior. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF 17 BETA-ESTRADIOL AND ETHINYLESTRADIOL ON THE GENDER DISTORTION AND FERTILITY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTOR
Kahla Nichole White
Latta High School, Ada Oklahoma, USA

Increasing levels of Ethinylestradiol, from overuse of birth control pills, have been found in drinking water. 17, Beta-Estradiol is the most potent natural animal hormone. The purpose of this project was to determine if elevated levels of EE2 and E2 affect the gender distortion or fertility of Drosophila melanogastor. The research hypotheses for this project were: (1) As the concentrations of both E2 and EE2 are increased the male to female ratio will shift toward an increased percentage of females; (2) As the concentration of both E2 and EE2 are increased the fertility will decrease; (3) Continuous exposure to both estrogens will cause a decrease in fertility during further generations; (4) E2 will cause a greater gender distortion and a decrease in fertility than EE2. <br><br> Stock solutions were created for both estrogens and three different concentrations were prepared. Triplicate vials were made for each estrogen concentration and added to the food mixture. Each generation was monitored over 20 days.<br><br> Female percentages were higher in generation 1 after exposure to E2 and EE2 as compared to control sets. Low and mid range concentrations showed stronger estrogenic responses in both estrogens, while the highest concentrations produced weaker responses. The generational gender distortion was significant from generation 1 to 2 with a 21.3% increase in feminization for the 20 ng/L EE2 and a 12.2% increase in feminization for the 1000 ng/L E2. An ANOVA indicated significance in generation 2 female fly percentages (Pr>F=0.0039) but not in type of drug treatment.

ENVIRONMENTAL CORRELATES OF CALLING OUTSIDE OF THE BREEDING SEASON IN FROGS
Robert Michael Tenreiro
The Fox Lane High School, Bedford, New York, United States

Numerous frog species in New York State vocalize during the breeding season to both advertise to prospective mates and defend their territory, however out of season calling has also been documented in these amphibians. It is believed that this anomaly in the frogs’ annual calling trends has a direct correlation with seasonal climatic conditions. This study documented calls from a sample community of frogs, occurring around a specific breeding pond, on a nightly basis for a total of five weeks in early fall, 2006. Frogs were identified by call, and the key aspects of the call. Consideration was given to frog species, call type, frequency of each call. After the findings were analyzed, a correlation between the frogs’ calls and the environment was noted. The study suggests that climatic trends similar to those occurring during the spring and summer breeding seasons, induced the frogs to vocalize as they would during the breeding season.<br><br>

DO BUMBLEBEES BASE FORAGING DECISIONS ON THOSE OF OTHERS?
Rachel Ellen Sitts
Croton-Harmon High School, Croton-on-Hudson, NY 10520 USA

Bumblebees are known to rely on members of their colony to provide them with valuable information about foraging. The goal of this experiment was to discover whether bees base their foraging decisions on the choices of other bees. In the field, bees (n=130) were offered a choice between a vase in which half of the flowers were occupied by demonstrator bees (dead conspecifics) and a vase in which all flowers were unoccupied. The first landing of each bee was recorded and each bee was marked. In the lab, bees were presented with a twenty-square grid on an arena floor, half of which contained a conspecific, to examine whether bees were attracted to conspecifics in a non-foraging and foraging context. The first ten landings of each bee were recorded. In the field, 57% of the bumblebees chose to land on an occupied vase. 64% of the bees preferred an unoccupied flower within the occupied vase (0.01<p<0.025). In the lab, all bees landed on an occupied square at least 70% of the time. A Chi-Squared test produced a p-value less than 0.005, indicating significance. These experiments suggest that the fact that bees often follow conspecifics is not necessarily an adaptation specifically to improve foraging; it is more likely a result of bees’ general attraction to one another. Future experiments should explore the reasons behind this tendency, compare results between subspecies, and investigate causes of the current decline in bee populations.

CHICKEN EGG STRENGTH FREE RANGE VS. CAGED
Carson Vaughn Wray
Blevins Junior High School, Fort Collins Colorado, USA

The experiment identified a problem: Do the affects of a free range chicken’s life style present stronger eggs opposed to the restricted life style of a caged chicken? This experiment was selected in response to observing the chickens I own.<br><br>I believe that free range chickens have stronger eggs because they live a better life style. This assumption is based on the natural environment free range chickens experience. Free range chickens have the ability to roam freely, which provides exercise, a natural diet, including insects, worms and other living organisms. Also, they generally experience a reduced stress living situation.<br><br>Based on research, most eggs available for the general public and found at local supermarkets are massed produced. These chickens live their lives in cages, and in many cases consume growth hormones and steroids.<br><br>To assess the strength of an egg, I constructed a method of testing. I placed an egg in an egg container on end, and then place a plastic tube over it. A series of weights were placed into the tube stacked on top of the egg until the egg finally broke. This would be repeated with both free range chicken eggs and caged chicken eggs. I then documented the results for each series of tests. <br><br>After performing the experiment, the results showed that my hypothesis was correct. The free range chicken eggs used for this experiment did hold up to more weight before ultimately breaking as opposed to the caged chicken eggs bought in the store. <br><br><br>

ATHLETIC CONDITIONING OF THE HORSE
MaryBeth Capell
Fremont High School, Plain City, Utah, United States of America

Sub- cardio exercise and cardio exercise are needed to obtain an ideally conditioned horse. The purpose of this project was to find the ratio between sub-cardio exercise and cardio exercise to achieve optimum conditioning. During cardio exercise the heart rate is doubled the resting heart rate. Sub-cardio exercise increases the resting heart rate but it never reaches double the resting rate.<br><br> Six horses were used within the scope of this project, making three pairs. The first pair was worked at a ratio of 75% sub-cardio exercise vs. 25% cardio exercise. The second pair was worked at a ratio of 50% sub-cardio exercise vs. 50% cardio exercise. The final pair was worked at a ratio of 75% cardio exercise vs. 25% sub-cardio exercise. Blood samples were drawn at the beginning and end of the trial period and then run through a machine which measures the hematocrit, hemoglobin, number and type of white blood cells.<br><br> It was found that the optimum ratio of cardio exercise and sub-cardio exercise was the ratio of 75% cardio exercise vs. 25% sub-cardio exercise. These findings were indicated by the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and number of white blood cells counts in each of the horse’s blood samples. <br><br>

Gamete cryopreservation can play an important role in conservation strategies for at-risk abalone species. Objectives of this study were to continue investigating red abalone egg cryopreservation protocols by determining whether eggs which exhibit normal phenotypes after thawing could be successfully fertilized with live sperm, and by evaluating propylene glycol (PG) as an alternative cryoprotectant agent (CPA) to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). <br><br> After induced spawning and egg collection, eggs were frozen using DMSO or PG at 8 and 16 mins stepwise cooling, before plunging into liquid nitrogen. 26 stepwise thawing protocols using 1.25g or 2.5g non-permeating sucrose/80ml water (as an aid in rehydration), and 20 in vitro fertilization tests were conducted. <br><br> Protocols using PG at 8 or 16 mins stepwise cooling, and stepwise thawing at 5 mins with 1.25g sucrose, yielded 90% to 100% (8 mins) and 75% to 80% (16 mins) intact round eggs with clear chorion. PG protocols using 2.5g sucrose during thawing yielded less than 10% such eggs. DMSO stepwise cooling (8 and 16 mins) and stepwise thawing (1.25g or 2.5g sucrose) protocols yielded 10% to 25% intact round eggs displaying little or missing chorion. Sperm orientation towards eggs during in vitro fertilization attempts occurred only in PG trials. No cell division occurred. <br><br> PG appears to be the more effective CPA, as chemical signaling between sperm and eggs, with release of egg chemoattractant (L- tryptophan), remained bioactive after cryopreservation. CPA toxicity, ice crystallization or other factors may have caused egg damage and prevented fertilization. Further research will involve refining protocols.<br><br>

CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ETHANOL-INDUCED DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY
Michael Kapps
Thornhill Secondary School, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada

The leading cause of mental retardation, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) results from fetal exposure to ethanol during pregnancy. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this disorder are not well understood. This project therefore aimed at improving our understanding of the biological basis of FAS by utilizing zebrafish embryos as animal models. <br><br> Embryos exposed to ethanol exhibited developmental defects in the heart, tail and in craniofacial and neural structures. Increased levels of cell death and reactive oxygen species were predominantly found in neural tissues, supporting previous observations that developing neural cells are particularly susceptible to membrane damage by free radicals. Known small molecules were tested for their developmental-protective effects, and three antioxidants (N-acetyl cysteine, choline, ascorbic acid) were found to attenuate malformations in embryos exposed to ethanol. Preliminary analysis of gene expression using RT-PCR indicated that embryos exposed to ethanol showed increased levels of Smoothened (part of the Sonic Hedgehog development pathway), suggesting that cells may be compensating for ethanol-induced loss of Hedgehog protein by up-regulating Smoothened. Morphology and gene expression phenotypes of ethanol and antioxidant-treated embryos were analyzed using two different genetic strains of wild type zebrafish. Results suggested that genetic background could, in fact, control some of the defects induced by ethanol, which can be correlated with intracellular production of antioxidants and/or the up-regulation of Smoothened. <br><br> The discovery of genetic susceptibilities and preventative treatments can be used for genetic screening tests and drug therapies, respectively, for women at higher risks of delivering babies with FAS. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF HERBAL TEAS ON THE ABILITY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER TO WITHSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
Barbara Shinaver
Sanger High School, Sanger, California, United States

The purpose of my science project is to determine if Drosophila Melanogaster bred on herbal teas are able to withstand environmental stress such as heat and cold. I used two different teas: Green Tea and Ginseng. I chose these teas because they yielded the best results of extending the flies’ longevity in my previous experiment. <br><br>I hypothesized that flies raised on teas would endure stress tests more successfully than the control; Green Tea more than Ginseng. I allowed a generation of flies to reproduce on the specific liquids, and used the newly emerged flies after aging two weeks for my tests. I placed ten males and ten females each in twelve vials for each treatment and stress. I tested vials of each treatment at higher than normal temperatures, ranging in even increments from 40 C to 46 C in ten minute trials, and at a constant freezing temperature for 35 and 45 minutes. After I removed the flies from their stress tests, I observed and recorded the number of living and dead flies. All flies tested were not reused. After collecting all data, I performed statistical analyses to determine the significance of the data. Using the ANOVA and S-N-K tests, I discovered that Green Tea helped flies survive both freezing tests and the 42 C heat test. These analyses also showed that Ginseng flies survived more than Green Tea flies in 44 C, and that Control flies thrived at 40 C. The variable high temperature test results warrant further research.<br><br>

WATER TEMPERATURE IMPACT ON FRESHWATER MACROINVERTEBRATES A COMPARISON OF AQUATIC LIFE IN FLINT CREEK ABOVE & BELOW SILOAM SPRINGS CITY LA
Carter Henrey Londagin 
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, United States of America 

In this experiment there are four sites (A, B, C and D) in the stream known as Flint Creek with three areas at each site. Macroinvertebrates are the identifiers for the quality of the stream in this experiment; they are susceptible to temperature variance. This project is to determine if the temperature variance in the lake known as City Lake causes harmful effects on the aquatic life living downstream from the lake in Flint Creek. <br><br> The hypothesis for the experiment was that the macroinvertebrate diversity below stream will be significantly less than that of upstream because of the naturally warmed water downstream from City Lake, and it was further hypothesized that the less tolerant macroinvertebrates will be more abundant upstream from City Lake than downstream.<br><br> To collect the macroinvertebrates I collected them in jars one from each site, took temperature readings while I was collecting, and took a sample of water from each site. Then the jars were taken back to a lab where the macroinvertebrates were counted and put into jars, and the water samples were until there was only one jar for upstream and one for downstream, then they were taken to a colorimeter and tested for Ammonia, Phosphate, and Nitrate. <br><br>The results from my experiments showed that the downstream sites had the diversity of macros as upstream, but the Biota Index Scores were vastly different with upstream having good ratings and downstream having fair ratings on a scale from poor-excellent. <br><br>

MACROINVERTEBRATES AS WATER QUALITY INDICATORS IN THE NORTH BRANCH OF THE CHICAGO RIVER
Eva Ruth Feldman
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois, USA

This project studied how populations of aquatic macroinvertebrates vary along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Four test sites were chosen. Two test sites, 1 and 2, were upstream of the junction of the North Shore Channel with the North Branch of the Chicago River and the other sites, 3 and 4, were downstream of this junction. It was hypothesized that there would be lower diversity and fewer pollution-sensitive species below the junction of the two branches as compared to above the junction.<br><br><br> One apparatus containing three multi-plate macroinvertebrate samplers at was used at each test site. The entire apparatus was submerged in the river for two weeks, then removed, the macroinvertebrates living on it counted and identified, and the pollution tolerance calculated.<br><br><br> The hypothesis was supported by the data. Sites 1 and 2 had average pollution tolerances of 3.00 and 3.04 (4 being the best) with 6 and 8 distinct species respectively, while Sites 3 and 4 had average pollution tolerances of 2.13 and 2.11 with 3 and 2.33 distinct species respectively. The differences in both the pollution tolerance and species diversity of Sites 1 and 2 compared to Sites 3 and 4 were statistically significant according to the Two-Sample T-Test.

AN ECOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY APPROACH TO DETERMINING PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS OF STREAMSIDE ANIMAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
Puja Jagdish Umaretiya
Chandler High School, Chandler AZ, U.S.A

Surface water flows in arid and semi-arid environments have declined worldwide due to excessive groundwater pumping (Groundwater Foundation 2003). The base flows of the San Pedro River have declined by sixty-six percent in the past ninety years. Organisms receive hydration in water-stressed environments by eating lower trophic level prey (Hadley 1994), thus the declination of base flows on the San Pedro may alter streamside animal community structure. Though traditional compensation hypotheses predict that wolf spiders compensate for the loss of surface water by increasing consumption of crickets, ecological stoichiometry suggests that consumption is dictated by water:nutrient (C:N:P) ratios of prey (Sterner and Elser 2002). This experiment sought to substantiate ecological stoichiometry theory by manipulating the water:nutrient ratio of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) and noting consumption by water-stressed wolf spiders (Arctosa littoralis). Crickets were dehydrated for 4, 8, and 12 hours to manipulate hydration states (ANOVA p=0.001) and there was significant variance between treatments (ANOVA p=0.006). Post-hoc comparisons showed that consumption of crickets at the MEDIUM hydration state was significantly higher from consumption at the LOW hydration state (TUKEY p=0.01). Consumption at the HIGH hydration state was not significantly different from either. The Threshold Resource Ratio suggests that predators seek out prey of an optimal water:nutrient ratio to reduce digestive, metabolic, and excretive costs during assimilation. The crickets of the MEDIUM hydration state were likely close to this ratio. This disproves the linearity of traditional conservation hypotheses and reveals a new bell-curve model for determining predator-prey interaction that could be used to predict organism abundance in riparian ecosystems.

EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT MODALITIES ON SPINAL MECHANICAL NOCICEPTIVE THRESHOLDS IN HORSES
Kayleigh Anne Sullivan
Valley Central High School, Montgomery, New York, United States

Back pain severely limits competition horses. Owners turn to alternative therapies to treat their horses, because Phenylbutazone (PBZ), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is illegal during competition. Chiropractic and massage are two prevalent alternative therapies, but controlled scientific research is limited. The objective of this study was to measure spinal mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) and evaluate the therapeutic effects of treatment compared with two different exercise-control groups. Thirty-eight adult horses were used to assess baseline mechanical nociceptive thresholds, which were measured at seven bilateral thoracolumbar sites in asymptomatic horses. The horses were assigned to three treatment groups consisting of instrument-assisted chiropractic treatment, massage, and PBZ. Two control groups consisted of either maintained ridden exercise without any treatment or routine paddock turnout without any ridden exercise. MNTs were repeated at 1, 3, and 7 days post-treatment. The percent change from baseline values were calculated within each group. At Day 7, the overall MNTs increased 22.9% in the chiropractic, 8.9% in the massage, and 6.5% in the PBZ groups. Minimal changes in MNTs were see in the active and inactive control groups across days. Chiropractic treatment and massage therapy were more effective than PBZ at increasing spinal MNTs in asymptomatic, actively ridden horses.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN KNOWN PORK QUALITY TRAITS AND THE SHELF LIFE STABILITY OF BERKSHIRE PORK
Emily Katherine Arkfeld
Lourdes Central Catholic, Nebraska City, Nebraska, USA

Quality is what ultimately drives a consumer to buy a specific meat product, but what exactly is quality? <br><br>The ultimate goal of my research was to find a superior category of meat by color, odor, and microbial growth. Six categories of meat were classified by standards set by the National Pork Producers Council for color and marbling. <br><br>My hypothesis was that the meat categories that were 1 to 2 (pale) in color would have the poorest meat quality, as determined by the consumer, and have the highest microbial growth pH. I also hypothesize that the meat 4 to 5 (dark) in color would have the best meat quality, as determined by the consumer and will also have abnormally high microbial growth. My procedure consisted of sorting through over 800 purebred Berkshire pork loins to find ten chops for each category. The samples we tested objectively by consumers on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10; they then were tested objectively for pseudomonas and lactobacillus. <br><br>In conclusion, the paler samples were the poorest in subjective measurements. No pseudomonas was detected in any of the samples. At the end of day ten the consumers liked the darker samples the best. As pH was taken, it also seemed that the pH readings were not only dependent on color but also on marbling. In conclusion, my hypothesis was proven partially incorrect and partially correct. <br><br>

HEAL THE EEL
Julie Ann Smoke
Salmon River Central, Fort Covington, New York, USA

This projects purpose was to determine if man's attempt to increase American Eel (Anguilla rostrata) populations are successful. The American Eel's decline is of great concern and is presently being addressed on all government levels. On August 9, 2006 the New York Power Authority, federal and state officials joined to formally mark the start of operation of the Power Authority's $2 million eel passage facility at the St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project. Therefore, I believe man's attempt to assist the eel's migration route will have a positive impact on the eel population.<br><br> Man is providing eel ladders to allow better access to their natural migration route. Stricter guidelines are being instituted for commercial fisherman and local industries are adhering to stricter pollution standards.<br><br> I researched the American Eel and obtained facts about their cycles and migratory behavior. After interviewing environment scientists from the St. Regis Mohawk Environment office and the New York Power Authority, I learned about the causes of eel decline in the St. Lawrence River System. By analyzing past and present data I observed the effectiveness of the eel ladder. I compared the data from the past commercial fishing and eel ladder counts and found that the eel ladder seems to be making some improvement.<br><br> My initial hypothesis was not really proved or disapproved. Other factors need to be explored such as: ocean floor activity and other environmental factors. At this time there does not seem to be enough information on whether or not man is making a positive impact.

LABORATORY EVALUATION AND FIELD EFFICACY OF CYCLOPOID COPEPOD SPECIES MESOCYCLOPS ASPERICORNIS ON AEDES POLYNESIENSIS MOSQUITO LARVAE IN AMERICAN SAMOA
Tuvale James Polu
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, American Samoa

Copepods, aquatic crustaceans, have been reported to possess predation on mosquito larvae. Studies were undertaken to test the effectiveness of an indigenous copepod species on Aedes polynesiensis mosquito larvae in American Samoa. Experiments were conducted under laboratory and field conditions. The collection of copepods utilized during this study was identified and confirmed as Mesocyclops aspericornis. This is the first report of this species in American Samoa. Results from different sets of lab experiments showed difference in predation rates, likely is linked to various factors such as, larvae size, copepod size, and container size. Field trials with copepod treatments showed a deduction in mosquito larvae as compared to control with only tap water. A relationship between number of copepods and survival of mosquito larvae were observed. Results from both experiments suggested that M. aspericonis is a promising biocontrol agent against Ae. polynesiensis larvae.

TOOTH STRUCTURE FUNCTIONALITY OF TYRANNOSAURUS REX VS CROCUTA CROCUTA
Nathan Robert Carroll
Carter County High School, Ekalaka, MT, USA

Unlike other carnivorous dinosaurs of its time, Tyrannosaurus rex had long conical shaped teeth, opposed to flatter, knife-like teeth more suited for shearing off flesh. This, combined with their high bite-force estimation (6672- 1330 Newtons), has led to the general consensus that Tyrannosaurus rex tooth impact on bone tissue was that of a crushing or fracturing nature. Crocuta crocuta (spotted hyena), is a unique carnivore that has adapted a bone-crushing style of scavenging, using a high bite force combined with short, sturdy teeth. The purpose of this experiment is to compare the crushing ability of Tyrannosaurus rex teeth to the crushing ability of hyena teeth. This was done using exact replicas of hyena jaws and sections of T. rex jaws cast in bronze and mounted on a hydraulic mechanism. Predation marks were re-created using bovine bones as a matrix. It was hypothesized that spotted hyena teeth are better adapted to crushing bone than Tyrannosaurus rex teeth. Of the 20 tests conducted on both sets of teeth, 17 crushing results were obtained from the hyena teeth and 4 crushing results were obtained from the T. rex teeth. Because the data are nonparametric and there were not at least five successes and five failures in each of the samples, statistical methods to determine if Crocuta crocuta teeth produced a greater amount of crushing than T. rex were not employed. It appears that the sample data supports the hypothesis that Crocuta crocuta teeth are better adapted to crushing bone than Tyrannosaurus rex teeth.

EWES SHOULDN'T REUSE NEEDLES
Mallory Gabrielle Wall-Tweten
Sumner High School, Sumner Wa, USA

Ovine Progressive Pneumonia is a retrovirus with a long incubation period and striking similarities to other viruses such as HIV in humans and CAEV in goats. In all 3 viruses the RNA of each virus becomes incorporated into the DNA of the animal’s cells, so once infected the animal remains infected for life. I believe OPP can be transmitted through needle reuse. HIV is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, so it seems probable that OPP would be as well. It is important to determine if OPP has a correlation with needle reuse because almost every sheep producer reuses needles until they are too bent to function. I contacted sheep producers to obtain blood samples and past data. Then I ran the cELISA test to determine if there were any OPP positive ewes. The data I received from one flock was particularly helpful, as it tracked the animals over three testing cycles, and I tested a selection of animals as a fourth cycle. There are a few ewes over three years of age who originally tested negative for OPP, but then tested positive over the next one or two tests. This suggests that they did not become infected from their mothers because of their age at the time of testing. Although my results indicate that there is a correlation, I cannot be positive. I intend to continue monitoring this flock as well as individual ewes.

THE ROLE OF FEED ADDITIVES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF SUS SCROFA
Adam Lee Hubrig
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND, USA

Purpose: To compare the use of an antibiotic (chlortetracycline), a probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus), and an herbal (derived from the yucca plant) feed additives on feeder hogs.<br><br>Procedures: Separated 40 Hampshire Landrace pigs into four groups of ten. The first group received chlortetracycline, and the second group received lactobacillus acidophilus, and the third received the standard feed as a control, and the fourth group received an herbal supplement. <br><br>Weight Analysis: From the outset of the project, and every two weeks thereafter, each hog was weighed, during an eight week testing period. The amounts of feed that each test group received were also recorded.<br><br>Parasite Study: Every two weeks monitored the number of parasites found in three milliliters of a mixture produced from the feces of each group.<br><br>Bacteria Colonization: Weekly monitored the number of bacterial colonies on four types of agar plates, two of which were impregnated with tetracycline. <br><br>Pathogen Study: Tested the additives and feed for inhibitory properties on eight pure cultures of bacteria. <br><br>Conclusion: Statistically, the feed additives had no significant impact upon weight gain. However, the antibiotic test samples seemed to have negative results on bacterial growth. The feed additive that was most beneficial in financial terms proved to be the probiotic, and did not have negative effects in other aspects of the study.<br><br>

TO DIET OR NOT TO DIET THE EFFECTS OF ASPARTAME ON MORTALITY RATE AND MEMORY RETENTION IN PLANARIA
Nathan Paul Marquez
Miami High School, Miami Oklahoma, United States

Miami High School States “By State Law Students are not allowed to buy sweetened beverages during the school hours.” This leaves only diet beverages, containing ASPARTAME, to be purchased. Aspartame is an artificial non-carbohydrate sweetener, common substitute in most diet beverages, and has been known to cause memory loss and death in humans. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of aspartame on memory retention and mortality rate in Dugesia tirigini, planaria. It is hypothesized that aspartame will inhibit memory retention while increasing mortality rate in planaria, and that as the concentration of aspartame increases the percent of planarian with memory retention will decrease and the mortality rate in planaria will increase. The null hypotheses are that there will be no difference in the memory retention or mortality rate among the experimental groups compared to the control group. During the investigation, Planaria were trained to travel one direction and then given an aspartame treatment. After the allotted timeframe, the planaria were tested for mortality rate and memory retention with directional choice. It was determined that the aspartame solutions tested increased the mortality rate of planaria, while the memory retention in planaria decreased.

THE EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN IN CRAYFISH
Jordan C Beck Kitchen
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, United States of America

Currently, the regulation and effects of hormones are being researched in depth. Some studies have concluded that estrogen has beneficial implications, while others show the effects of estrogen are devastating. My research, with injecting estrogen into crayfish, has yielded both results. Weekly, I would inject crayfish with a specified concentration of estradiol, perform at least one half-tank water change, record general observations, measure the exerted force, and video movements. The effects of estrogen followed a standard bell curve. Moderate levels of estrogen (50% of LD50) helped the crayfish live longer, exert a higher maximum force and a greater total integral of force; however, they had an increased amount of necrosis and decalcification of the carapace. Extreme amounts of estrogen (100% distilled H2O and 100% LD50) caused the crayfish to not live as long and exert a weaker force compared to moderate levels. To measure the effects of estrogen, I initially made a strage gauge and preformed dissections of the neural ganglion. Much of the force was lost, however, and the dissections showed little, if no change. So, I used an Newton meter and Logger Pro instead. To measure the decalcification, I used an electronic caliper. Moderate levels of estrogen (50% and 75% LD50) showed a decrease in carapace thickness compared to that of no injection. One explanation is that the true effects of estrogen could not manifest themselves in the higher concentration. I strongly believe this is due to the fact that most of the high concentration crayfish died before the long-term effects could take place. As to the extreme concentration of no estrogen (100% distilled H2O), I believe the solution was too hypotonic. Instead of masking the effects of the estrogen, it actually caused more devastation. My hypothesis was correct: moderate levels of estrogen are in fact beneficial for the crayfish. They increase their lifespan and allow them to exert a stronger and more constant force.<br><br>

CALLS IN THE WILD: VOCALIZATIONS OF THE RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER
Michael Tyler Wham
Sterling Ridge Homeschool, The Woodlands, Texas, USA, 77382

The endangered Red-Cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) is a keystone species; more than 30 other species use nesting cavities created by the RCW. Management of the RCW affects the use of more private and public land in the Southeast than any other endangered species.<br><br> <br><br>There are limited examples of this bird’s calls, and limited documentation of the contexts of the calls. The purpose of this study was to record the calls of the RCW simultaneously with the corresponding behaviors or environmental stimuli, so that the degree of similarity in calls could be objectively compared. It was hypothesized that a computer-generated spectrogram analysis of RCW vocalizations could objectively identify and distinguish between vocalizations. <br><br> <br><br>Video cameras with directional microphones were positioned around an active cluster of trees and over 50 hours of audio/video recordings were made. “Greeting”, “begging”, and “distress” calls and the corresponding contexts were recorded. These calls were captured with a video-editing application, then a time-frequency browser and spectrum analysis tool was used to plot the data, including frequency in Hz, duration in milliseconds of notes and of the intervals between notes. A detailed spectrogram of each call was produced and the calls were compared and analyzed.<br><br><br><br><br>The hypothesis was confirmed: the context of each call could be objectively determined. A computer program was then developed to record and identify the call type and to notify wildlife managers of significant events, such as the presence of nestlings or attacks by predators, in order to assist in the management of this endangered bird.<br><br> <br><br>

MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF APLYSIA NEURONS' ELECTRIC SIGNALS DEPENDING ON PERIODIC TEMP CHANGE
Kwangbum Hyun
Jeju Science High School, Jeju, South Korea

This project demonstrates how firing patterns of Aplysia neurons change on the stimulus of periodic temperature change. By using automatically recording and computing programs, I measured the state change of action potentials continuously firing and also I calculated the specific membrane conductance depending on temperatures. <br><br> Electrode was pinned on Aplysia neuron, whose action potential was measured. By using resistance temperature detector of Pt 100, both action potential value and data of peridically changing temperature were automatically recorded on the computer. Out of 30 large abdominal ganglions, six neurons whose four cells were beating and two bursting at room temperature displayed data over 1,000 minutes. And on those six cells, action potential signals were saved at the ratio of 3,000 samples per one second in hard disk. <br><br> In beating cells, as temperatures increased, spike frequency and average specific membrane conductance of Aplysia neurons went up. However full width at half maximum, average spike height, and resting potentials decreased respectively. In bursting cells, interburst interval and average spike amplitude went down, but spike frequency and conductance rose.<br><br> I found that the temperature change stimulus made Aplysia neurons display various electric signals. The results came from data saved at high speed. Existing papers on Aplysia neurons delt with data by using pen writer, so that data on heat change stimulus and analyzed variables resulted in a few. But when these programs were used for result analyses, precise quantitative analyses of data got to be obtained. I trust this project can contribute to the developement in neurobiophysics. This project is to be extended to acquire more data on various cells. Then such an approach as this to biology will disclose biological phenomena, and we may glance a secret of physiological systems. <br><br><br><br><br>

GENE EXPRESSION DURING FIN GROWTH IN ZEBRAFISH: THE ROLE OF THE GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN CONNEXIN43 IN VERTEBRATE BONE DEVELOPMENT
Isha Himani Jain
Freedom High School, Bethlehem, PA, USA

Direct intercellular communication in vertebrates is primarily modulated through gap junction channels, which are composed of connexin proteins. Of these, connexin43(cx43) is the most widely expressed in humans. However, its specific function in different tissue types remains elusive. Mutations in human cx43 cause the genetic disorder oculodentodigital dysplasia, characterized by pleiotropic defects, including craniofacial bone deformities and syndactyly. For this reason, understanding the role of cx43 in bone growth is essential. Interestingly, the zebrafish mutant shortfin(sof) is also defective in cx43 and therefore serves as an excellent model system. In fact, the cx43 gene is ~80% conserved between zebrafish and humans. <br><br> Previous studies in mammals and chick indicate that cx43 regulates osteoblast differentiation. A similar function during zebrafish bone growth was hypothesized. Extensive quantitative reverse transcription PCRs were performed to detect gene expression levels in sof and wildtype tissues. An ~80 fold lower cx43 expression was observed in sof. Next, candidate genes were tested in pathways for bone patterning, early/late osteoblast differentiation, and the fgf signaling pathway. Surprisingly, expression of sonic hedgehog(shh), sprouty4(spry4), runx2a, fa95f02 and collagen(col1) was not affected, indicating that cx43 was involved in a process upstream of osteoblast differentiation. Subsequently, cx43’s role in mesenchymal cell proliferation was considered. In-situ hybridizations detected cx43 mRNA, and H3P staining detected cells in mitosis. Cryosections showed that proliferating mesenchymal cells expressed cx43. In conclusion, a new role for cx43 in the induction of mesenchymal cell proliferation was discovered. Future work will employ a microarray analysis to determine comprehensive gene expression. <br><br>

The Iguana iguana is an invading specie in Puerto Rico. It has proliferated in all of the island’coasts and has been considered a threat for endemic species of birds. This investigation was to study the demography, the nesting ecology and the eating habits of the iguanas in the town of Toa Baja. The hypothesis established that if there is a high population density of iguanas it will endanger and reduce the native birds population and mangrove trees. The transect technique in rowboat was designed and the observation stations technique was adapted so that the detection of iguanas was more accurate. It was observed that the iguanas used to destroy the birds’ nest to feed on their eggs and it also ate the leaves of mangrove and fruit bearing trees. Twenty two Iguana iguana nests were observed and there was an average of 52-68 eggs. The data was analyzed with the Distance 5.0 (Bucklan et. al. 2000) Program. The obtained statistical values evidenced a high abundance index (84.3 – 168.0) and a density estimate of 86. 0 to 264.0 Iguana iguana per 1.6 km. The proportion of adult by sex was one male for three females (1:3). There is a high correlation between the population density and the index of abundance. A management plan was designed to solve this ecological problem. It consisted of exporting the frozen meat of iguana to countries in Central America where it is the main source of food and it is in danger of extinction.<br><br>

HOLD YOUR HORSES DO NEW SCENTS STIMULATE HORSES' RESPIRATORY RATES?
Kimberly Ann Hope
Metcalfe County High School, Edmonton, Kentucky, USA

Does a novel scent affect the respiratory and pulse rate in horses? I hypothesized that exposure to various scents will alter physiological parameters such as respiration and pulse rate. I tested eleven horses of varying sex and ages ranging from one to twenty-nine with four novel scents: cinnamon, vanilla, dried lavender, and fresh cut onions. I monitored respiratory and pulse rates before and after introduction of each scent. During various trials, scent presentation was altered. Between trails animals were given time to recover from the previous scent. Reactions to the new scents varied. Numerous studies have linked increased heart rate and respiration to stress in horses. An application for this study would be to identify scents that have a calming effect and thus an anti stress effect on horses. This could help horses adjust to a new environment or to a new mode of transportation.<br><br>

DETECTING EVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN POPULATIONS OF WHITE-TAILED DEER
Ethan Douglas Sperry
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN, United States of America

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are considered a ubiquitous species throughout North America; however, they were once reduced to 100,000 individuals. Through conservation efforts, the species has recovered to nearly 30 million and has been reintroduced to many locations, providing a unique opportunity to study how evolutionary processes have shaped their genetic variation. I am investigating how these processes affect the genetic structure of a managed and isolated population of deer in Maryland (PAX). This population was originally founded from 15 deer in 1964 and grew to 400 individuals at which point it has undergone annual harvesting of approximately 50%. The first year of this study (134 individuals analyzed across six microsatellite loci) confirmed the presence of a genetic bottleneck. Analysis of the founder event was inconclusive. In the second year of this study, I have added 66 individuals to the original study and 53 deer from another location in Maryland (WFA). Additionally, I analyzed two additional microsatellite loci and genetic sequence from a subset of individuals from both locations. Microsatellite analysis has confirmed a bottleneck that results from the annual harvesting of the PAX population as well as from the WFA population. DNA sequence analysis was used to test three models of genetic variation as an indicator of gene flow. Results indicate a model that represents either high ancestral diversity or dispersal. Congruence between microsatellite and sequence analysis indicates that the relocation and rapid expansion of deer populations may result in a deviation from the genetic expectations for the populations.

RED SEA FRINGING CORAL REEF IN DISTRESS - ASSESSMENT OF RECENT CHANGE - YEAR THREE
Zaki Daniel Moustafa
A.W. Dreyfoos High School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida, United States

In summer 2006, the third year of data was collected from a pristine, fringing Red Sea coral reef (29°32' N, 32°24' E) that lies at the northernmost limits worldwide. Surveys of this one-kilometer long reef included photo quadrats and video transects, supported by a suite of environmental measurements including temperature, water quality, and sediment biogenic composition. To assess this reefs survivalship and post-spill impacts from a nearby oil spill in August 2005, video surveys from annually sampled ten-meter transects were collected and a random photo quadrat survey was conducted. Results were compared to 2004 and 2005 measurements.<br><br> <br><br>Although statistical tests do not indicate a significant change in overall coral populations, results from 2006 do show a significant increase in fish bite marks, disease, bleaching, sedimentation, algal smothering, and mottling / discoloration to the coral; all signs of ill health and reef degradation. A decline in fish abundance and diversity was observed, and oil remained on the reef just below the surface sediment, and on semi-sessile organisms.<br><br> <br><br>Since 2004, Staghorn, the dominant coral, has decreased 11%; more than the noted combined growth of the 2nd and 4th most abundant corals, Neptheidae and Anemone, respectively. Changes in species diversity indices from transect data are mixed depending upon their location, and suggest that multiple environmental factors are influencing this community. Collected accessory environmental measurements are being examined to extract relationships to observed reef health. As monitoring continues, the fate and resilience of this delicate community to survive man-made and natural stresses remains uncertain.<br><br>

SHOO FLY SHOO YEAR 6: THE CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN THE PUPACIDAL EFFECT OF COMPOUNDS IN MINT ESSENTIAL OILS ON DIPTERANS
Howard Malcolm Tomlinson
Brenham High School, Brenham, Texas, United States

The purpose of this project was to determine if compounds found in pennyroyal and peppermint essential oils such as á-pinene, methyl acetate, menthone, and limonene would be effective in inhibiting the emergence of various Dipterans such as Musca domestica and Sarcophaga bullata. Fly pupae was used in a transparent cylinder which contained a sample of the mint compound being tested. The pupae were observed for several days to determine the number of emerged pupae compared to non-emerged and partially emerged pupae. Of the compounds tested, 100% inhibited the emergence of flies to some degree. <br><br> The pupacidal effect of various mint compounds on dipterans are as follows: Musca domestica was inhibited 5.0% by methyl acetate, 12.0% by á-pinene, 22.0% by limonene followed by menthone at 99.0%. The average percentage of Musca domestica that failed to emerge in the control was 6.0%. Sarcophaga bullata was inhibited 20.0% by methyl acetate, 24.0% by limonene and 32.0% by á-pinene, followed by menthone at 91.0%. The average percentage of Sarcophaga bullata that failed to emerge in the control was 12.0%. I conclude that menthone was significantly more effective as an inhibitor on the emergence of Musca domestica and Sarcophaga bullata than any other compound tested. <br><br> Menthone was an effective pupacide in inhibiting the emergence all dipterans tested. The natural emergence rate of dipterans was 81.0%. The pupacidal effect of various mint oil compounds on dipterans was 87.5% by methyl acetate, 79.0% by á-pinene, and 77.0% by limonene followed by menthone at 5.5%.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF IMIDACLOPRID SOIL DRENCHING ON TERRESTRIAL TARDIGRADA OF THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, TN: A MICROFAUNAL RESPONSE TO A. TSUGAE INSECTICIDE CONTROL
Ana Marie Lyons
Mecosta-Osceola Math/Science/Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI, United States

The purpose of this study was to determine if imidacloprid soil drenching used to combat the invasive Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae) affects the population dynamics of local soil-inhabiting tardigrades. A field study was conducted at a highly infested stand of Eastern Hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN, where treated and untreated trees were equally present. A total of 40 soil samples were extracted from the bases of 20 trees that had either been soil drenched with the systemic insecticide imidacloprid or left untreated. Soil samples were processed with the Ludox method and were searched for microscopic life under low magnification. Amounts of tardigrades and other notable microscopic organisms were recorded, and tardigrade specimens were mounted on slides for later identification. Total numbers of tardigrades and all other soil microbiota were compared between treated and untreated groups with the use of a two-tailed equal variance t-test (alpha level 0.05) which generated no significant differences. Once identified to species, Simpson’s Concentrations, the Shannon’s Index, effective number of species, species richness, mean biodiversity indexes, and the Chao 1 mean were calculated for the contrasting tardigrade populations with the use of the software program EstimateS. Untreated samples were found to be an average of 2.287455 times more diverse in tardigrade species distribution than samples collected around trees that had been treated with imidacloprid. Additionally, a pending new species of eutardigrade, Murrayon n. sp., was discovered exclusively from an untreated sample, further indicating that treated soils offer less opportunity for biodiversity than untreated soils. These results suggest that imidacloprid soil drenching may influence non-target soil microorganisms by affecting their diversity characteristics and likewise impact the overall health of the greater ecosystem.

AN EXAMINATION OF DENSITY DEPENDENT SETTLEMENT ON BARNACLE SPECIES OF THE GENUS BALANUS
Christopher Ryan Peterson
Ocean Springs High School, Ocean Springs, MS, USA

Barnacles are a type of crustacean that is common to the United States Gulf Coast. Based on the results of previous experiments, this year I tested to see if there was a density-dependent effect on the recruitment of barnacles. I hypothesized that there would be a negative density dependence, meaning that fewer barnacles would settle in a given time on a crowded surface. I had two series of boards consisting of four replicates each. I collected water temperature, salinity, and water clarity measurements every other week for 8 weeks when I counted the settlement and measured the diameter of the largest 10 barnacles. After each count, I removed all barnacles from one series (the Scraped group), while leaving them on the other (Control group). At the end of the 8 weeks, I left the boards in the water for 2 months to allow the barnacles to grow large enough for easy identification. Balanus eburneus and B. improvisus were found. There was a strong correlation between the overall density of barnacles and the salinity. Statistical analysis showed there to be a significant difference between the densities of the two series in weeks 2 and 3 of the experiment. This supports the theory of density-dependence, although this effect was not apparent during periods of high salinity. This project contributes an increased understanding of the settlement and growth patterns of barnacles in estuarine waters.

BACTERIA'S LUMINESCENCE AS MECHANISM OF RECOGNITION OF THE EGGS' LAYING ORDER BY BIRDS
Anna A. Pahlevanyan
Private school "New Education", Moscow, Russian Federation

The published data suggests that cuckoo birds throw out host’s eggs from the nest when they place their own egg to host’s nest. The thrown egg is usually the first one laid.<br><br>Purpose: identify a possible mechanism cuckoo bird uses to identify the eggs laying order. <br><br>Hypothesis: the photoluminescence under the ultraviolet radiation of sunlight of continuously growing population of bacteria on egg surface allows birds to approximate the eggs laying order. <br><br>The radiation of a mercury lamp with wavelength of lyambda=360*10^-9m was directed through a narrow slit on the reflective grating. The UV line can be observed on the camera display as a purple-lilac line. <br><br>We photographed the eggs in UV range (delta lyambda=340*10^-9 - 400*10^-9m). The part of the shell without presence of bacteria reflected UV radiation, while parts of the shell with bacterial presence showed photoluminescence confidently observable to the human eye (blue light). <br><br>We were the first to obtain the colored pictures of hen’s (Gallus gallus domesticus) and quail’s (Coturnix japonica) eggs removed from the nest for a short period of time. While photoluminescence was barely detectable on the freshly laid eggs (dots), the pictures obtained after 3-5 day period depicted noticeable blue spots. After another week elapsed, the concentration, area and intensity of luminescent spots increased. <br><br>Conclusion: the dynamics of development of bacteria’s photoluminescence on the egg shell under the sunlight radiation can be used by birds to detect the eggs laying order by birds, due to the higher sensitivity of birds’ retina to the short wavelength radiation. <br><br>

ON THE LUMINESCENT PROPERTIES OF MNEMIOPSIS LEIDYI
Dmitri Viktor Skjorshammer, Thomas Burr
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL, USA

Mnemiopsis leidyi is able to luminesce. Knowing that Mnemiopsis leidyi is abundant in our local area, we decided to investigate what causes and what factors affect the luminescence of these invertebrates. <br><br> We approached the problems posed by experimenting with the effect that electricity, temperature and color have on Mnemiopsis leidyi and then explaining the luminescent properties using the gathered data.<br><br> Using electric shock, we discovered that light travels only from the umbrella to the tail, not in the opposite direction. In addition, using the effects of temperature and the data we gathered, we concluded that the reaction behind luminescence is spontaneous. Several small experiments with comb rows gave us the ability to explain the chemistry of the luminescence. The inhibition of luminescence through different colors of light showed us that blue inhibits the luminescence the most. Finally, we determined that Mnemiopsis leidyi was able to refract the light we directed toward it. <br><br> In conclusion, the luminescent properties of Mnemiopsis leidyi stem from the light organ located in the umbrella part of the jellyfish. The light travels through the comb rows, in which the protein aequorin reacts with calcium ions to form apoaequorin and light. The light travels from the umbrella to the tail, and the reaction behind the luminescence is spontaneous. The inhibition of luminescence through different colors of light suggests that only certain wavelengths inhibit the reactants. Finally, Mnemiopsis leidyi was observed having refracting properties.<br><br>

INVESTIGATING THE MOLECULAR VARIANCE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CELLANA EXARATA FOUND ON GARDENER PINNACLE, MOLOKAI, AND HAWAII
Romelynne Fernandez Lamosao, Sheryl Acidera
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI, USA

Many people have mistakenly assumed that all Hawaiian Limpets, opihis, have the same life size. According the biotechnology and DNA, there are many types of limpets or opihis. In fact there are about four known species on the Hawaiian Island Chain itself. If scientists or student researchers looked into this a little more than just observing the daily life of an opihi by observing the molecular DNA of an opihi, there may be a possibility that the living opihi populations may survive a faze near extinction. <br><br> In this experiment, we took several samples of opihis found on Gardener Pinnacle, Molokai, and Hawaii. We put each sample into a solution that digested the DNA tissue, and left only the pieces of DNA. We extracted the DNA from the solution, and then made a PCR recipe to attach primers to each DNA sample. With the primers attached to each DNA sample, the DNA samples to the sequencing lab. The sequencing lab then returns us with sequences of each DNA sample with A, T, G, and C nucleotides. Then we analyzed the data through Arlequin 3 program and determine whether there is a difference or similar characteristics between the assumed species of opihi found on Gardener Pinnacle, Molokai, and Hawaii. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CELASTROL ON THE ACTIVATION OF HEAT SHOCK RESPONSE AND LONGEVITY IN C.ELEGANS
Lusine Galoyan, Chandrika Sridharamurthy
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills New York, USA

The experiment was conducted to increase the amount heat shock proteins (HSPs) produced in N2 strain C.elegans. HSPs are molecular chaperones that promote proper folding of proteins, and ensure that those proteins reach their designated locations within the cell. Celastrol is a constituent of the Chinese Thunder of God vine (Tripterygium wilfordii). It was hypothesized that treating C.elegans with celastrol, will increase the induction of HSPs, due to their cytoprotective abilities. It was also hypothesized that celastrol will aid in increasing the lifespan of C.elegans due to its possible activation of the heat shock response, and prevention of certain types of apoptosis. Wild type (N2) C.elegans were treated with celastrol, and were subjected to an increase in temperature (environmental stress) to induce the heat shock response. The results of the experiment indicated that an increase in lifespan and the amount of heat shock proteins induced did occur in the specimens treated with celastrol. These changes were noted at both temperatures compared to the untreated control groups. Lifespan assays determined length of larval stages in all groups. Qualitative morphological changes in treated worms were noted. Therefore, celastrol may have the potential to be used as a chemical inducer of the heat shock response. The favorable implications of celastrol on C.elegans will open new pathways for experimentation of celastrol on humans as well. Additionally, as the C.elegans genome is similar to that of humans, identifying the mechanisms of lifespan in C. elegans will help in understanding the process of aging in humans.<br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CELASTROL ON THE ACTIVATION OF HEAT SHOCK RESPONSE AND LONGEVITY IN C.ELEGANS

The experiment was conducted to increase the amount heat shock proteins (HSPs) produced in N2 strain C.elegans. HSPs are molecular chaperones that promote proper folding of proteins, and ensure that those proteins reach their designated locations within the cell. Celastrol is a constituent of the Chinese Thunder of God vine (Tripterygium wilfordii). It was hypothesized that treating C.elegans with celastrol, will increase the induction of HSPs, due to their cytoprotective abilities. It was also hypothesized that celastrol will aid in increasing the lifespan of C.elegans due to its possible activation of the heat shock response, and prevention of certain types of apoptosis. Wild type (N2) C.elegans were treated with celastrol, and were subjected to an increase in temperature (environmental stress) to induce the heat shock response. The results of the experiment indicated that an increase in lifespan and the amount of heat shock proteins induced did occur in the specimens treated with celastrol. These changes were noted at both temperatures compared to the untreated control groups. Lifespan assays determined length of larval stages in all groups. Qualitative morphological changes in treated worms were noted. Therefore, celastrol may have the potential to be used as a chemical inducer of the heat shock response.

SEARCHING THE GENE ESSENTIAL FOR DROSOPHILA DEVELOPMENT: IDENTIFICATION OF ESCARGOT
Hung-Jen Chen, Lai Tsai-Ta
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Using the Drosophila model, we studied how overexpression of genes induced a certain phenotype of shorter antennae and defects in the anterior equatorial region of eyes. Five strains with these phenotypes were obtained from 1,800 strains by molecular screens between the P-element lines (EP lines) and the pattern lines overexpressing a gene dll, abdA, or Ubx under the leading of promoter eq, or pattern lines expressing GAL4 under the leading of one specific promoter eq, ey, or dpp.<br><br> In this study, we used plasmid rescue and inverse PCR to check the insertion site of the P-element and get the flanking sequence of a gene responsible for the defective phenotype. Finding that EP was inserted in the upstream of gene escargot (esg), we identified the involvement of esg in the developmental control.<br><br> To understand the spatiotemporal control of Esg protein in Drosophila development, we performed the staining of imaginal discs of "wild type", "eq>esg cross with UAS-GFP", "eq>GFP (control)" and other strains with antibodies (anti-Dll, anti-Caspase3, anti-Esg, etc.) The results showed that protein Esg cannot be detected in the eye disc of three-instar larvae in normal. Overexpression of Esg caused the defects of distal antennae and the anterior equatorial region of eyes, indicating its expression level needed to be controlled for cell status and cell destiny.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF FLUID MECHANICAL PRESSURE ON THE REGENERATION IN PLANARIA
Matthew Adam Woo, Austin Chang
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, New York

Over 6,000 people died last year waiting for organ transplants (United Network for Organ Sharing). Stem cells are the key to help solve this problem. Some scientists believe that physical pressure might have some effects on stem cell differentiation (Tang, 04). The purpose of this experiment is to see what effects fluid pressure has on Planarian blastmea cells regeneration. The experiment had 6 dorsal ventrally cut planarian put into microcentrifuge-tubes; and observed their growth daily at pressures of 1.0 x10^5 N/m^2(control), 1.10 x10^5 N/m^2(3ft), 1.19 x10^5 N/m^2(6ft), and 1.28 x10^5 N/m^2(9ft). The tubes were fastened at depths of 3 feet, 6 feet, and 9 feet on strings, and lowered into a 10-foot water column. For each trial, planarian were observed and given a ranking from 1 to 6, based on a scale developed by Sarraf (05). These ranking represented how far along the planarian were in the regeneration process. This process was repeated 6 times for all groups, totaling 576 planarian. Photos of the planarian development were taken at each stage. Results indicate that at the lowest depth, the regeneration process was slower and poorer in quality than the control. There was a significant difference in the quality and rate of regeneration of the planarian, between the control and 9ft variable group. A One Way ANOVA test followed by a Sheffe post hoc found a p<.01. A Kruskal-Wallis test also found a p<.01. Greater fluid pressure seems to degrade rate and quality of stem cell regeneration.

OH, WHERE HAS MY MEMORY GONE? (A PLANARIAN'S PERSPECTIVE)
Rose Yee, Victoria Yum
North Park Collegiate and Vocational School, Brantford, Ontario, Canada

The question addressed in this project was whether the memory of a learned behaviour that was taught to a whole planarian (Dugesia tigrina) would be retained by only the head region (where a “rudimentary” brain is located) or by the tail region as well (after cutting the whole planarian in half). The hypothesis was that both the head and tail regions of the planarian would separately retain the memory of the learned behaviour. It is thought that memories in planaria are not just stored in the brain but in the form of molecules that can be found throughout its body.<br><br> <br><br>To conduct the experiment, a “task” (to turn “left” in a modified t-maze) was taught to an experimental group of 25 planaria. Once the planaria had learned the task, they were cut into anterior (head) and posterior (tail) halves, allowed a period of “adjustment”, and then the head and tail regions were tested separately to see whether the “memory” of which way to turn had been retained. <br><br> <br><br>Data were collected on the number of trials it took each planarian to initially learn the task and then, after cutting the planaria in half, on whether the separated head and tail regions could individually remember the task. It was found that tail regions “remembered” the direction to turn in the t-maze as well as the head regions. Memory does not appear to require the planarian’s “brain”. <br><br>

UV-B RADIATION AND APHID-PARASTOID INTERACTIONS: THE INFLUENCE OF UV-B RADIATION ON VARIATION IN RESISTANCE TO PARASITISM IN ACYRTHOSIPHON PISUM (PEA APHID) POPULATIONS.
David William Charles, Colleen Quigley
Salpointe Catholic High School, Tucson AZ, USA

Recently there has been a proven reduction in the stratospheric ozone layer and increases in UV-B radiation. Environmental change affects factors such as populations and genetic diversity of insects. Pea Aphids have been proven to genetically respond to environmental changes with infection by facultative bacterial endosymbionts like Buchnera(5a) and Hamiltonella defensa(A1A-5A) which confer resistance to parasitoid wasps. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if exposure of Pea Aphids to UV-B radiation would affect the symbiont-mediated resistance to parasitism by A.ervi. <br><br>We Built two UV-B radiation chambers. One radiated a low level of UV-B (200 cW/cm2), one a high level (310 cW/cm2). We exposed the aphids to A. ervi (wasps) for parasitism and then 6 hours of UV-B per day. After ten days we counted parasitized aphids, live adults, and offspring. We assessed the degree of effect by analyzing the data using logistical regression (Oneway Anova Analysis).<br><br>We analyzed for both aphid code and UV-B exposure. Results indicated the greatest number of parasitized adults occurred in the high UV-B, 5a aphids ( mean 6.000), low UV-B, 5a aphids( 3.6000 mean), low UV-B A1A-5A aphids (1.86667) and the lowest number of parasitized aphids occurred in the high UV-B A1A-5A aphids, (3.60000 mean).<br><br>Natural enemies are important to the ecological balance and adaptive change in insects. The contribution of this experiment is establishing that of the two variables, aphid code and UV-B radiation exposure, the aphid code was a significantly stronger indicator of resistance to parasitism than exposure to UV-B radiation.<br><br>

TEMPERATURE & SAND FLY (LUTZOMYIA VERUCARRUM) DEVELOPMENT
Amanda Mary-Ruth Davenport, Christine Elisabeth Danielson
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA

Lutzomyia verucarrum is a strain of phlebotomine sand fly that is a vector of numerous parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and bartonellosis. Leishmaniasis (in its different forms) is a problem in over 88 countries with unprejudiced transmittance. Although leishmaniasis is not prevalent in the United States, soldiers overseas are still subject to infection. There is no efficient cure for either disease so prevention is the key component in stopping the spread of these maladies. This strain typically thrives at 22°C while the others prefer a warmer temperature of 26°C. In order to study the effect of temperature on the life cycle of the L. verucarrum colony, two assemblages of isolines were kept at the two temperatures. If the only variable is temperature, then the cohort at 26°C will have an accelerated mean generation time compared to that of the 22°C cohort, and the same survival rate. <br><br>In order to compare the effect of temperature on sand fly development, a control group was reared in an incubator at 22°C while the experimental group was reared in an incubator at 26°C. Each group consisted of 50 blood-fed females that were captured from a mating cage into individual vials. These vials were studied daily upon the completion of the pre-oviposition phase to monitor the life cycle of the larvae. <br><br>The results showed that the mean time of each developmental stage was shorter at the higher temperature which contributed to an overall accelerated life cycle. Both cohorts had similar survival rates however, the number of adults that emerged varied by approximately 400 percent. <br><br> <br><br>

THE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN AND ITS MIMICKER ON MALE CALLOPLESIOPS ALTIVELIS
Mykal A Eden, Joanita Mathews
Billings West High School, Billings, MT, USA

The amount of fresh water on our planet is limited while the world’s population is consuming more and more each year. Human induced pollution is a very significant concern. Among the water pollutants increasing worldwide is Estrogen Sulfate and a number of its mimickers. One such mimicker is Bisphenol-A (BPA), a runoff pollutant from plastic factories that falls into this category. While estrogen has been extensively researched in reproductive studies (Krishnan et al), the mimicker BPA has not. The purpose of our study is to show that BPA mimics the estrogen compound E1S1 and has the same effect on male Calloplesiops altivelis’ aggression. Our hypothesis states that the BPA will have the same effect as the E1S1 by reducing the aggressive behavior of the treated fish. To determine aggression we counted the number of gill flares and charges each fish made in response to its reflection during a two minute trial period. We determined that BPA has a statically significant (t-stat= -11.98 at a 95% confidence) effect on aggressive behavior in this fish by reducing gill flare activity within the treated group.

Biological control agents, such as parasitoids, are now widely used to control the population of agricultural pests. These parasitoids find their host according to various chemical compounds. Most of these compounds come from volatile plant extracts especially those obtained from aromatic plants. The potential use of these chemicals in the biological control of pests led to the use of Coleus amboinicus Loureiro (oregano) as attractant of the parasitoid, Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead.<br><br> <br><br> This project aimed to test the effect of oregano extract on the orientation and stimulation activity of the parasitoid, Trichogramma japonicum. Specifically, it aimed to determine which concentration of the extract (5 mL extract to 500 mL distilled water, 10:500, 15:500 or pure oregano extract) is the most efficient attractant of the parasitoid.<br><br> <br><br> The effect of the Coleus amboinicus extract on the attraction response of the parasitoid was determined by the amount of time the Trichogramma japonicum spent inside the treated filter paper during the petri dish bioassay, while its effect on the parasitization of the parasitoid was determined through the number of Corcyra eggs parasitized by the Trichogramma japonicum in a vial still containing treated filter paper.<br><br> <br><br> The study showed that Treatment 3 (15:500) was the most attractive concentration for the parasitoid, and Treatment 5 (control) as the least attractive. Treatment 3 also yielded the most significant effect on the parasitization of the Trichogramma japonicum. Thus, the researchers conclude that Coleus amboinicus extract, specifically the third treatment, has the ability to attract the parasitoid and stimulate its oviposition.<br><br>

SEROTONIN GIVES YOU A GOOD SHIVER
Neel Pandit
Westview High School, Portland, OR

The temperature of the environment around us is constantly changing and our body has to adapt constantly to maintain homeostasis. Shivering in skeletal muscles is our last strategy to defend our body temperature against cold challenges from the environment. There is still much to be known about this mechanism. Although it is known that serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in the central nervous system mechanisms that regulate several homeostatic responses, how 5-HT contributes to the basic mechanism for producing a shivering response to cold stimuli remains unknown. In this project, I found that 5-HT, acting through 5-HT2A receptors in the spinal cord, has a stimulatory role in the central neural process that evokes involuntary muscle contractions in response to environmental cooling. Cooling of the rat’s trunk skin increased the electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the neck muscles. I found that the skin cooling-evoked activation of EMG was reduced by 63% following an intravenous injection of katanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor blocker (antagonist). In a separate set of animals, a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), produced an EMG activition similar to skin cooling-evoked subcutaneous muscle contraction, which was maintained even after an interruption of the neuronal pathway. These results indicate that 5- HT potentiates the neuronal signals transmitted from the brain to the spinal cord that facilitates involuntary contractions in skeletal muscles in response to reduced environmental temperatures.

THE EFFECTS OF FEEDING AVIAN ANTIBODIES SPECIFIC TO CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGEN A TO PREVENT PORCINE CLOSTRIDIAL INFECTIONS
Brady John Welu
Marshall High School, Marshall, MN

Our farrowing barn has been affected by moderate scours for quite some time. I took fecal samples of some piglets and they were diagnosed with having Clostridium perfringens A for which there is no commercial vaccine available. I decided to try avian antibodies. My hypothesis was that I should be able to get a 100 to 250 grams of weight gain per day difference when the piglets are on avian antibodies. <br><br> I grew up two liters of Clostridium perfringens A in an anaerobe chamber. Then I centrifuged the bacteria out and took the broth and the packed cell volume and made an immunogen with both the bacterin and the toxoid. I injected 25 chickens with this immunogen once a week for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks I took 6 of their eggs and did an E.L.I.S.A. test on them. The test proved that the antibodies bound to the bacteria. I made two products out of the chicken eggs, one for sows and one for piglets. I separated our farrowing barn into four separate groups: sows get product, sows and piglets get product, just piglets get product, neither get product (control). I took litter weights every 3.5 days.<br><br> Due to the heat, I had trouble getting sows bred in August for this test. Clinical signs and data on 12 of the sows and piglets proves my theory this far, but am still collecting data on another 8. When I get a big enough sample size I will statisticlly analyze my data.

FIELD STUDIES OF THE CIRCADIAN MIGRATION PATTERNS OF ARGOPECTEN IRRADIANS
Molly Helen Reichert
Columbia High School, Lake City, FL

Argopecten irradians, the Florida bay scallop, is a bivalve that possesses a simple ocular system and a method of movement. If scallops use vision to direct movement, is there a circadian pattern to their migration? A hypothesis was made that scallops would travel farther in daytime than at night because their ocular system works better in light. To study this in the field, scallops were collected and tagged using cyanoacrylate glue and fluorescent surveyor's tape. They were returned to the water near a marked buoy and after twelve hours they were located and their migratory distance and direction were recorded. The first two experiments focused on the distance and direction of the scallop's movement in the day versus the night (n=62). It was discovered that the average migration distance during the day was 8.0 feet while at night it was 8.7 feet. There was no statistical difference in the distance during the day than during the night (p=0.05). Additional experiments were performed to find out if there was another reason for the distance and direction of the scallop’s movement. The next four experiments studied the affect of the sea floor topography on scallop migratory patterns. A number of scallops were placed in sand while other scallops were placed in grass (n=47). The average distance traveled when placed in grass was 4.7 feet, while in sand the average distance was 12.4 feet. This time there was a statistical difference, and scallops placed in sand migrated farther than those in grass (p=0.05). The probable explanation is that scallops preferred to stay in the relative protection of the grass and therefore did not migrate very far. But when placed in sand, scallops naturally migrated farther to reach the grass and its protection. Argopecten irradians represents a multi-million dollar renewable resource to the Florida economy. This experimental procedure offers scientists a valuable tool to study the affects of ecosystem changes on Florida bay scallop behavior.

VITAMIN A: THE SUPPLEMENT'S AFFECT ON THE MINDS OF FANCY MICE
Chelsea Noel Kenny
Franklin W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to try and find an answer to the medical debate on whether or not vitamin supplements are beneficial to the mind. Thirty-two Mus Musculus (fancy mice) were used in the experiment, sixteen receiving a Vitamin A supplement and sixteen not. Half of each group were male, the other half female. Once a week, after the cages where cleaned the mice would be tested by showing each mouse a treat, letting them smell it but not eat it. Then the treat would be hidden in one of three different shaped boxes. The mice where placed in an enclosed area 120cm back from the boxes. Once the mouse started going after the correct box, the test would start over and be repeated until the mouse knew to run directly to the correct box, recording each time it takes. The mice where given fresh food, water, and vitamins (for those receiving them) daily as well as being talked to for one minute a day. The project was done over a one month period, and the mice were kept as pets. The mice on Vitamin A did not have a smaller average than the mice not taking the supplement, so the hypothesis was proven correct. Using statistical tests, the data was proven to be statistically insignificant (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test only yielded a difference of one).

THE COMPARISON STUDY OF CENTRIFUGATION VS. PASSIVE FLOTATION IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF INTESTINAL PARASITISM IN CANINES
Kayla M Dunn
Cape Coral High School, Cape Coral, FL

Parasitic infections are a common problem in domestic canines. When these infections go untreated severe health risks and even death can occur. Most private veterinary clinics use only one method of examination. The two methods of parasitic analysis are centrifugation and passive flotation. This experiment observed whether centrifugation was more effective than passive flotation when testing for intestinal parasitism in canines. <br><br>Fecal samples were collected from various breeds of canines at Baywood Veterinary Hospital in Cape Coral, Florida. The samples were taken by a skilled veterinarian technician and were divided and tested using the two methods of parasite analysis (centrifugation and passive flotation). Once tests were complete, all fecal solutions were examined under a microscope at a magnification of 10x. Samples were examined and compared to one another using intestinal parasite counts. 65% of the trials demonstrated an absence of parasites. However, the results of centrifugation provided significantly more positive results when compared with the positive flotation method. <br><br>In conclusion, this experiment demonstrated centrifugation as the most effective procedure for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitism in canines. All canines should be tested with this method although they are not. When visiting a local veterinary office one should ask their vets what method is used for the welfare of their companions.

THE EFFECT OF HABITAT LOSS ON SURVIVAL POTENTIAL AND DECREASING SALINITY ON TENACITY OF THE FOOT IN THE MARINE SNAIL, NERITA ATRAMENTOSA: POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL WARMING?
Nina Imalka Pinto
Hornsby Girls High School, Hornsby, NSW, AUSTRALIA

Habitat destruction and decrease in salinity have been predicted as consequences of global warming. This study assesses the comparative survival potential of the inter-tidal snail Nerita atramentosa, and the effect of decreasing salinity on the tenacity of its foot. The survival potential was assessed using a quadrat in five replicates on gully, rock pool and plateau habitats at La Perouse, Australia. Nerita atramentosa had an intermediate survival potential as it occurred in two habitats compared to Nodilittorina uinfasciata in three habitats and Morula marginalba in one. Tenacity of N. atramentosa was determined using acclimatized organisms attached to the sides of a glass aquarium. A looped wire was glued to the snail shell and hooked to a string that passed over a pulley with a weighing pan on the other end. Weights were added systematically to the pan till the snail lost its grip. Tenacity was measured in 10 replicates each, at 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% sea water and without water. The average tenacity ranged from 52g in 100% sea water to 8g in freshwater. The highest average tenacity of 55g was for the un-submerged snails. Since decreasing tenacity would dislodge snails and expose them to predators, this experiment shows another potential effect of global warming.

THERMOREGULATION OF THE ZEBRA (EQUUS BURCHELLI)
Zoegne du Preez
Hoerskool Waterkloof, Pretoria, Gauteng, SOUTH AFRICA

Literature research shows that black and white stripes of zebras are for identification, social interaction and camouflage against predators. Mention is made of a possible role in thermoregulation, but no research reports and possible reason could be found. This research focuses on whether the unique black and white stripes also play a role in possible thermo regulation of zebras, by causing small vortex-like air movements all around the body of zebras. <br><br>The temperatures of black and white striped carton, the stripes of a zebra hide (trophy skin) and the stripes of a live zebra were recorded. Black stripes were constantly warmer than white stripes: ( 8, 66°C in the carton; 2, 83°C in the trophy zebra hide and 1,88°C in a live animal). Black and white striped carton were left in the hot sun for more than two hours. Smoke from rocket-fuel and colored smoke bombs were used to demonstrate upward flow of hot air above the heated black stripes and downward flow of cooler air above cooler white stripes. Photos were taken to visualize vortex effect.<br><br>Results clearly showed that black stripes absorbed more radiation energy, and consequently emitted more heat, warming up the air above the black stripes. This resulted in an upward flow of warmer air above the black areas, while the cooler air above the white areas circulated downward. This results in hundreds of circulating air turbulences (vortex effects) all around the body of the zebra to help cool it down during very hot days.

THE EFFECTS OF SEROTONIN ON CIRCADIAN PATTERNS AND BEHAVIORS IN DROSOPHILA
Ann Simone Cooper
Lafayette Senior High School, Lexington, KY

It is established that adult Drosophila show circadian patterns that are regulated by gene expression. Circadian cycles in adults can be induced and set by exposure to light as early as the embryo stage without any circadian patterns evident throughout the larval stages. I hypothesize the maintenance of the circadian pattern throughout the larval stages can be modulated by altering the serotonin expression levels in the larvae. This in turn will then affect the adult circadian pattern. To approach this I exposed larvae, at various stages, to a drug (p-CPA, 10mg/ml of food) that blocks the synthesis of serotonin and then examined circadian patterns in adults. Adults were tested on 12:12 light:dark cycle and in continuous darkness. I also assayed whole animal adult behaviors (i.e. response to light and righting reflex) in controls and larvae that were fed p-CPA. In order to measure circadian patterns I built a device to measure activity of adults as individuals and groups. The fundamentals of the device are an IR light source with a detector monitored by an online program. The results of feeding larvae p-CPA led to a more distinctive circadian pattern, which was contrary to my hypothesis. As adults, the p-CPA fed larvae showed a slower climbing response to light (p<0.05, n=15, T-test). Associative learning assays showed that the p-CPA fed larvae showed a more pronounced learning. The p-CPA fed larvae had a compromised immune system. In summary, p-CPA fed larvae had altered circadian patterns and behaviors as adults.

A MOSQUITO'S QUEST FOR SUGAR: A NOVEL APPROACH IN THE DETECTION OF PLANT SPECIES AFFECTING MOSQUITO SUGAR FEEDING BEHAVIOR AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN ADULT MOSQUITO CONTROL
Joseph Concepcion Roney
Clay High School, Green Cove Springs, FL

This project in its present form is the result of a study of eight plant species that were targeted as possible nectar sources for the mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes aegypti, in order to aid in the research and development of future residential and commercial pesticide products relating to mosquito control and, indirectly, control and prevent arthropod-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus, dengue fever, malaria, and encephalitis. Both male and female Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus had high survival rates of 53.5 and 78.9 % respectively on Pentas lanceolata and 55.9 and 48.1% on Quercus virginiana. Aedes albopictus also had high survival rates on Asclepias curassavica and Persea borbonia with 55.5 and 52.5% respectively.<br><br>Nectar sources were determined through the collection and isolation of plant species, aspiration of select mosquito species, percent mortality observations in 24 hour increments within mosquito species grouped by the plant species, and fructose readings from Cold Anthrone Testing. Chemical isolation and verification utilizing Degenerate Polymerase Chain Reaction and performing a choice-box chamber test is ongoing.<br><br>The contributions of this study are twofold. First, there is a strong correlation between flowering plants and high survival rates within mosquito species, further demonstrated through the presence of sugar detected from Cold Anthrone Testing. Secondly, all mosquito species used in the experiment yielded unexpected survival rates on Quercus virginiana and Persea borbonia providing statistically significant evidence which supports further investigation of these plant species as nectar sources for mosquitoes.

EVALUATION OF ARTIFICIAL DIETS FOR REARING METAMASIUS CALLIZONA (COLEOPTERA: DRYOPHTHORIDAE)
David Arthur Pick
Olivet Private School, Port Saint Lucie, FL

The Mexican bromeliad weevil, Metamasius callizona (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae), is threatening 12 species of native Florida bromeliads to extinction. Presently, M. callizona and its natural enemy, the parasitic fly Lixadmontia franki (Diptera: Tachinidae), are being reared in a biological control program using the unreliable resource of pineapple crowns from local supermarkets. Investigating other diet resources could increase the production of L. franki for field release in south Florida. This project aims to study the use of 7 oligidic diets for rearing M. callizona: 1) fresh pineapple leaves (control); 2) fresh and 3) lyophilized pineapple core; 4) fresh and 5) lyophilized ball moss; 6) fresh and 7) lyophilized Spanish moss. Weevils on every diet except fresh and lyophilized pineapple core diets developed to adulthood. Weevils fed pineapple leaves had the highest mean female and male, pupal weights (132.65±5.65 mg and 131.48±7.79 mg, respectively) and female and male adult weights (80.17±5.85 mg and 69.33±1.71 mg, respectively). Weevils fed pineapple leaves also had the shortest mean developmental time from egg to pupa (38.7 days)for males and (57 days)for females. Larvae on Spanish moss had a higher survivorship rate than larvae on other diets. An emergency plan can be developed using this data since M. callizona and L. franki could continue to be reared using both Spanish and ball moss in the event of a pineapple crown shortage.

PROVIDING HABITAT FOR THREATENED DRYMARCHON CORAIS COUPERI UTILIZING SIMULATED GOPHERUS POLYPHEMUS BURROWS
David Brown Futch
Winter Haven High School, Winter Haven, FL

This longitudinal study provided threatened Eastern Indigo snakes a secondary habitat, modeled after gopher tortoise burrows. It was hypothesized that Eastern Indigo snakes would inhabit simulated burrows if environmental conditions were similar to natural burrows and that during the fourth year study a larger percentage of burrow inhabitation would be observed due to the burrows commingling with nature over time. Four years of research with additional observation and analytical research on annually selected factors were conducted to evaluate and determine inhabitation.<br><br> During the fourth year study, two additional burrows were installed. Based upon previous year’s results, all vented burrow caps were replaced with solid caps. Relative humidity and temperature were investigated more extensively, analyzing and comparing both variables during summer and winter with two-week trials to determine simulated burrow’s conditions changing with seasons. During the summer months, the simulated and natural burrows provided a constant average temperature of 27°C and 96% relative humidity. During the winter, temperature averaged 20°C and 92% relative humidity. This year’s study has seen an increase in inhabitation as compared to previous years. This year, 87.5% of the simulated burrows were inhabited compared to 50% during previous year’s studies. This included the sightings of four indigo snakes and ten opossums. After close analysis of these factors, it was concluded that conditions were highly correlated with the interior of a natural burrow.

HISTOPATHOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF CARCINOGENESIS IN PLANARIANS SECONDARY TO ULTRAVIOLET C, B & A EXPOSURE, YEAR TWO
James Edward Fichtelman
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, FL

Planaria, free-living hermaphroditic flatworms, propagate asexually by binary fission, regenerate from small fragments, and culture easily in the laboratory environment. The presence of pigment phenotypes including black, brown, and white (Dugesia dorotocethala, Dugesia trigina, Phagocata morganii, respectively) make planaria an attractive model for studies in pigment cell biology. Sub-epithelial glandular cells, rhabdoids, produce and transfer pigment granule-containing rhabdites through the basement membrane to the overlying epidermis and influence the gross pigment phenotype. For this study, these different pigment phenotypes were treated with UVC, UVB, or UVA to ascertain the relevance of using planaria for studies of UV-induced changes in pigmentation. <br><br> Effects of UV induction include changes in terms of survival, tissue damage, suggestive tumor formation, and pigment production. Light and electron microscopy reveal a tanning response to the radiation insult. The planarian pigmentary system reacts to ultraviolet radiation with the increased production of rhabdites. Confocal laser scanning microscopy identifies the rhabdites and rhabdoids as fluorescence quenching factors. In addition, transmission electron microscopy illustrates morphological differences in rhabdites and rhabdoids after radiation exposure. <br><br> UV-induced tanning and carcinogenic responses establish the planaria as a model system for studies of pigment cell and cancer cell biology.

CAN DIFFERENCES IN FAT-PROTEIN RATIOS IN THE MILK OF DAIRY COWS INDICATE KETOSIS? A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Joy Lynn Burnham
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, FL

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if fat-protein ratios, taken by the AFILAB Milk Analyzer System, could be used to indicate ketosis, a metabolic condition. I hypothesized that the ratios could be used to indicate ketosis based on research I had read.<br><br>To test my hypothesis, I used data from 420 Holstein cows at the Dairy Research Unit at the University of Florida. When these cows were milked, the fat and protein percentages were calculated for each cow at each milking. These measurements were recorded by the AFILAB computer system and sent to me weekly. When I received data, I calculated fat-protein ratios of each cow at each milking.<br><br>To analyze the data, I composed a spreadsheet of all the ketosis negative cows and the ketosis positive cows. I developed a base line ratio of 1.50 and considered cows with ratios of 1.50 and over "flagged" for ketosis. Specificity was 99% and sensitivity was 34%. A data change calculation showed that cows that tested positive for ketosis had statistically higher fat-protein ratios than cows that tested negative for the disorder.<br><br>My hypothesis was proven correct by specificity and a data change calculation.

CHICKEN EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT AFTER EXPOSURE TO MMT, A FUEL ADDITIVE, YEAR TWO
Tess Linnea Peterson
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) is an organometalic compound that works as an octane booster in gasoline. MMT contains the hard metal manganese. Researchers at Iowa State University found that acute MMT exposure triggered apoptosis in PC-12 cells. Researchers at Tsinghua University found that Mn triggered apoptosis in yeast cells. With this information, it was hypothesized that exposure to MMT triggers manganese induced apoptosis in stem cells, causing retardation and possible deformation in chicken embryo development.<br><br>To test this hypothesis, fertilized chicken eggs were exposed to concentrations of 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1% MMT on one of the first six days of incubation/embryonic life. Each of the 6 days of exposure, 3 eggs were exposed to pure ethanol. These eggs created the + control group. Three eggs were exposed to no substances. These eggs created the – control group. The eggs incubated for 16 days total. At the end of 16 days, the eggs were removed from the incubator and placed in a freezer to terminate embryo development. The eggs were removed from the freezer and let thaw. Parameters of growth of the embryos were measured. A second trial was performed. In both trials, embryos exposed to a 0.01% MMT solution on day one of embryonic life experienced the most growth retardation- 37.60% in trial 1 and 37.38% in trial 2. This was proven statistically significant using a t-test. Tissue samples were taken from the embryos in this group. Corresponding samples were taken from embryos in the + and – control groups. An atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed on the tissue samples to measure the concentration of Mn in the tissue. Zero Mn was detected in any samples. DNA fragmentation was observed in an agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA had degraded so that no conclusive results were obtained. With this information, the tentative conclusion was made that Mn induced apoptosis does not cause growth retardation in chicken embryos, which did not support the hypothesis.

NON-INVASIVE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY OF SMALL LABORATORY ANIMALS
Garik A. Melkumian
School No. 42, Lugansk, Luganskaya Oblast, UKRAINE

Current project is dedicated to the development of non-invasive instrumental complex for determination of the cardiac rhythm of small laboratory animals (rats and mice). Project is focused on the reduction of stress to the animal according to the 3R strategy (Replace, Reduce, and Refine). Non-invasive ECG that is performed on human subjects is impossible for the laboratory animals due to the size, necessity to shave certain areas and associated stress. Motional activity of the animal also impairs registration of cardiac electric potentials. Current measurement methods involve immobilization, anesthesia or implantation of the electronic sensor devices that cause severe stress and subsequent morbidity for the animal and giving unreliable ECG readouts. <br><br>Suggested instrumental complex for cardiac rhythm variability measurement in small animals consists of a special insertion on to the cage with series of conductive readout electrodes that register electrocardiac activity through its feet. Observational studies indicated that animal is motionless during drinking; therefore specially designed insert with walls and wire electrodes that are positioned at 45-degree angles was placed under the water nozzle. Such setup ensures that all neighboring feet are in contact with alternating electrodes that are connected to the preamplifier of the electrocardiograph and provides good steady readout. In order prolong the time animal spends drinking, special water nozzle with smaller aperture is implemented. Electrical signals are routed via preamplifier to the computer sound card input and analyzed by pickup tool of MATLAB software. Suggested measurement method provides good reliable readouts and no animals are hurt during procedure.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ORGANIC METHOD TO COMBAT VARROA DESTRUCTOR BEE MITES, YEAR III
Ernest G Wright
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

The importance of bees to our economic welfare can not be over emphasized.<br><br>They not only provide honey and wax, but serve as pollinators for some of major crops worldwide. Parasitic mites are a common and serious pest of bees. Various treatments have been developed to rid hives of these parasites, but many of the treatments harm the bees and reduce queen production and longevity. This paper reports on the use of sassafras roots as a smoker fuel to fumigate hives. The results were promising with 61% more mites killed by this method as compared to the control. Last year, the active ingredients of the sassafras smoke were tested to determine whether they have any adverse effects on the honey bees and how much effect the chemicals, individually, had on the bee mites. Three major chemicals of sassafras were tested—safrole, limonene, and camphor. Initial tests have shown that camphor is the most lethal to varroa mites. This year I made extractions of sassafras root. I ran the extractions through a gas chromatogram mass spectrometry in order to determine what method of extraction is most efficient. This is important because industrial beekeepers would like a pure product instead of a “home remedy” sort of treatment. The ideal procedure would extract a high volume of safrole and camphor. I am also working on developing a procedure of testing the treatment on mites that are isolated from honeybees, as there is currently no practical method of culturing or isolating bee mites. I would also like to figure out whether sassafras smoke leaves any harmful residue in honey and develop a practical method for isolating many varroa mites from bees in order to verify my initial results.

DNA GENDERING OF SAW-WHET OWLS (AEGOLIUS ACADIUS)
Catherine Elizabeth Ishitani
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

Current gendering of most non-ratite bird species is performed using physical characteristics such as weight and wing chord length. Using specific ratios derived from these measurements, bird gender can accurately be determined within certain size ranges. However, a significant portion of birds cannot be labeled male or female, because of borderline male-female ratio results.<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to determine the gender of non-ratite birds, specifically Saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadius), using non-invasive DNA molecular gendering techniques combined with physical measurements.<br><br>Under the supervision of Quarry Hill Nature Center naturalists, Saw-whet owls were caught in standing mesh nets. Physical measurements of the owls were taken, including weight, wing chord length, and culmen and halix length. Next, buccal swab DNA samples were collected, suspended in TE Buffer, and frozen in microcentrifuge tubes. The DNA from the swabs was then isolated using a Qiagen DNeasy DNA extraction kit. After elution, the DNA was concentrated and underwent PCR and gel electrophoresis. Gel results were used to gender the owls based on DNA fragment band placement techniques. DNA fragments were sequenced, confirming correct gene amplification.<br><br>Data suggests female owls have larger wing chord lengths and greater weights than males. Culmen length was determined to be a strong marker of gender differentiation. A procedure for molecular sexing of Saw-whets using buccal swabs was optimized. The success of this experiment proves the hypothesis to be correct: noninvasive buccal swab DNA can be used to gender non-ratite birds, and Saw-whet owl gender correlates with physical characteristics.

ACTUAL VS. EXPECTED: A TWO YEAR STUDY OF CHAROLAIS BULL STATISTICS
Abbey Elaine Thiel
Isabel High School, Isabel, SD

My research this year included two objectives. Both objectives were designed to compare traits and EPDs to price of a purebred Charolais bull. The goal of my first objective was to find the percentage of bulls within certain parameters of their predicted price, using a formula derived from last year’s project. The goal of my second objective was to find which type of data more accurately predicted price, EPDs or actual traits. <br><br>I began my project by gathering data from Charolais breeders around the country. After receiving the data, I used Microsoft Excel to enter the data. For objective 1, I found the percentages of bulls within certain dollar amounts of their predicted price. For objective 2, I used simple regression and the Pearson Product Moment Correlation to find the coefficients of each trait to price. I then used multiple regressions and the Data Analysis Toolpak on Excel to come up with multiple regression coefficients, from which I derived two formulas. One formula included only EPDs; the other formula included only actual traits. <br><br>In objective 1, I found the greatest percentage of bulls were within $251 to $750 of their predicted price. In objective 2, I found that the actual traits formula was more accurate in predicting price. Greater numbers of bulls were closer to their predicted price when applied to the actual traits formula than the EPD formula. <br><br>I hope from this project, bull producers will better understand the traits desired by their customers when purchasing seed stock.

DO WILD BIRDS HAVE A SCENT PREFERENCE?
Elizabeth Anne Salvaterra
Bishop Donahue High School, McMechen, WV

My project’s purpose was to determine if the scent of wild bird food will effect how much of it is consumed. I wanted to determine if it is worth purchasing more expensive bird seed mixes that have special scents. Manufacturers charge more money for special blends like this, but it is known that birds have a very poor sense of smell. My hypothesis was that the scent would have no effect on how much food was consumed.<br><br> As my procedure, I sprayed five different scents/flavorings on batches of seeds. I placed identical bird feeders, each with a different scent and a control with no scent, outside. Every third day I weight what remained in each of the feeders and added a suitable amount. I recorded all of this data. After twelve days, I repeated the experiment with double the amount of flavoring to determine if the concentration of the scent changed the results.<br><br> After I had calculated my data, I discovered that for the first run of the experiment, the totals showed no correlation because some scented seeds were consumed more, and others less. The second run, with double the amount of flavoring, resulted differently. Every one of the feeders with scented seeds had a higher total consumption by at least 2.2%. From this I concluded that the birds could use their weak sense of smell to distinguish the different smells of the seeds. I also concluded it is not worth it to purchase the commercially sold scented blends.

DETERMING ODOR-PREFERENCE IN LARGE MILKWEED BUGS
Kari Abraham Jackson
Benjamin E. Mays High School, Atlanta, GA

Based on the current research of Johnson (2007), many species of insects that are in the Order Hemiptera the sub – order Heteroptera are responsible for millions of dollars in damage to fruit and vegetable crops. Despite the widely use of insecticides to control these pests, Miller (2007) research revealed that insecticides are ineffective in controlling many of the insects of the Order Hemiptera. The problem of this study was to understand what odors could serve as attractants or deterrents in Oncopeltus fasciatus’ odor sensory the most frequently. Oncopeltus fasciatus were the subjects used to conduct this investigation despite the fact they are not pest. Nevertheless, the Oncopeltus fasciatus were selected because there are commonalties with those insects who are pests and have similar plant preferences. The hypothesis of this study was that Oncopeltus fasciatus were most likely attracted to odors that resemble their natural attractants: sunflower seeds, contact pheromones, and scent glands. The methodology was conducted by placing Oncopeltus fasciatus in glass t-tubes that were laced with different odors in the opposite arms of the tubes, and monitored for movement. The research revealed that Oncopeltus fasciatus were not attracted pure Hexan, a chemical used to extract contact pheromones from insects, and extract odors from sunflower seeds. Also, this study demonstrated that females Oncopeltus fasciatus were slower in their movements, unlike males, who were quicker to respond. The data from this study should be utilized to identify more effective ways of exterminating insect pests, particularly those of the order Hemiptera.

REPELLING SHARKS THROUGH THE MAGNETIC STIMULATION OF THE AMPULLAE OF LORENZINI
Brooks Daniel Ruder
Keystone Upper School, San Antonio, TX

People have long searched for safe, reliable ways to repel sharks from beaches and commercial fisheries. Repellants are often harmful or fatal to sharks. This project’s goal was to move towards creating diving and fishing gear with magnetic properties that repel sharks by utilizing their ampullae of Lorenzini. This project examined the reaction of Whitespotted Bamboo Sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) to high strength neodymium iron boron magnets (NIBMs) in both territorial and feeding situations. Because these sharks hide in tubes, two types of tubes (magnetic and non-magnetic) were placed in the shark pools. The number of times the shark swam into each tube was recorded. To simulate a feeding situation, dishes with or without magnets were placed in a feeding apparatus with four pieces of food. It was hypothesized that in both situations, the NIBMs would slow, if not completely stop, feeding or territorial behavior. In both tests, one shark was never tested with magnets as a control. The sharks swam into the non- magnetic tubes 286 times, and the magnetic tubes 31 times. The probability of this happening by chance is less than 0.0001%. The feeding test data appears inconclusive, although there may be a small deterrent effect. In conclusion, NIBMs strongly repel sharks in territorial, although not in feeding, situations. If strong magnetic fields can repel sharks, the goal is to eventually incorporate magnets into aquatic activity gear as a repellent, which could provide a cheap and strong barrier to recreational divers, sport fishermen, and tribal fishermen alike.

ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY THEORY AND SPECIES EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF FRAGMENTED FORESTS
Christina Marie Brinster
Kent Island High School, Stevensville, MD

The Wilson and MacArthur (1967) Theory of Island Biogeography proposes that the number of species on an oceanic island is a stable equilibrium resulting from the opposing rates of colonization and local extinction. I have attempted to apply their model to bird species found in five terrestrial forest fragment “islands”. <br><br> Each fragment was censused annually over 4 years. A hand-held GPS unit was used to determine the area of each forest fragment and to navigate a census transect created by mapping software. I determined the average number of species on each, annual rate of immigration and extinction, and the total species pool able to colonize these “islands.” Each fragment held a different, but constant (equilibrium) number of species set by the loss of some species and the introduction of new ones between censuses. I constructed an equilibrium model of each “island” by plotting rates of immigration or extinction (y-axis) against species number (x-axis). The extinction rate line connects (0,0) and the equilibrium point. The immigration rate connects (species pool, 0) and the equilibrium point. The lines intersect at each “island’s” equilibrium number of species. <br><br> Similar to Wilson and MacArthur’s prediction, my models indicate the extinction rate declined as forest “island” size increased. Unlike their prediction, my models indicate the immigration rate increased slightly with larger forest fragments. This may be attributed to habitat diversity or forest configuration which were not factors in their study of oceanic islands.

EFFECTS OF LARVAL AGGREGATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ASCIA MONUSTE
Bruna Favetta
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, SP, BRASIL

Ascia monuste is a common butterfly of the family Pieridae, occurring in urban areas in Southeastern Brazil. They are usually found feeding on plants of the family Brassicaceae. The present study aims to investigate the effects of larval aggregation on A. monuste performance. The hypothesis is that aggregated larvae should have a superior performance than the larvae in smaller groups or isolated. A total of 104 butterfly larvae were reared, with food ad libitum (host plant is collard greens) in 6 boxes with ten larvae each, six boxes with five, and 14 boxes with one larva. After emerging, all butterflies were killed. For each treatment, it was recorded larval development time and adult size (right anterior wing length). The average wing length was of 3.31 cm for butterflies in groups of ten, 3.42 cm for butterflies in groups of five; and 3.37 cm for isolated larvae. There was no strong difference between average wing lengths among treatments. In contrast, the isolated larvae took longer to develop when compared to the other treatments. The conclusion is that the degree of larval aggregation affected the performance of this species. In addition, isolated larvae remained more time in the host plant, being more exposed to predation than aggregated larvae.

REFINING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LEFT/RIGHT ASYMMETRY IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Pukar Hamal
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills, NY

Left/Right asymmetry has been quite an age old topic in science; much research has been done on different animal species to understand this asymmetric phenomenon and its long-term developmental roles. This study endeavored to refine the established understanding of left/right asymmetry in the nervous system exemplified by the two ASEL (left) and ASER (right) gustatory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. The FOZI-1 protein is a crucial regulatory factor involved in proper development of the ASE neurons. To further study the generation of asymmetry among both ASE neurons the transcription factor FOZI-1 was labeled with YFP (yellow fluorescent protein). The labeled FOZI-1 was introduced into the worms as an extrachromosomal array containing DNA sequence encoding for the fusion protein FOZI-1::YFP, which then was genomically integrated. This integrated strain of fozi-1 was run through various tests using advanced microscopes and genetic crosses with mutant strains to further understand the importance of this gene regulatory factor. Based on expression of previous gene regulatory factors in the ASE neurons it was inferred that FOZI-1 exhibits a biased and dynamic expression pattern. It was discovered that FOZI-1 does indeed have this dynamic expression pattern in the context of the ASE head neurons; thus raising further questions about the role of FOZI-1 in the development of the ASE. This research will further the understanding of asymmetry generation/development of the ASE neurons and the true implications of fozi-1 into this process. Studying such complex neuronal pathways could potentially answer further questions about our own neurological and developmental anatomy.

THE SECRET LIFE OF THE PREPUPAL EMERALD ASH BORER
Martin Daniel Bobb
Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Delaware, OH

This project was developed to answer the question, “how are the mass, length, and head diameter of prepupal emerald ash borer larvae related?” The purpose of the project was to study the physical characteristics of Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) larvae. EAB, an exotic pest in North America, is a threat to native ash trees. This experiment tested the hypothesis that mass, length, and head diameter of EAB prepupae collected from heavily infested ash trees in Delaware, Ohio, would be related and normally distributed. To test the hypothesis, 1m logs of infested ash trees, measured and peeled by the US Forest Service, were examined for larval plugs. Prepupal chambers were opened with a drawknife to expose larvae. Larvae were removed and physical characteristics were measured as previously described. Results showed a positive linear relationship among the three measurement types. It is concluded that the hypothesis was supported; there is a relationship between EAB mass, length, and head diameter. After sampling 77 prepupae, it is difficult to determine whether the data was normally distributed. Measuring head diameter was difficult and inaccurate, contributing to the large distribution of values in that data set. While extracting prepupae, two plugs were consistently found associated with all prepupal chambers, with one larger than the other. This suggests that after pupation, the adult beetle will exit through the second, larger hole made as a prepupal larva.

NATURAL MOSQUITO REPELLENTS: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOTANICAL EXTRACTS AS REPELLENTS AGAINST AEDES AEGYPTI MOSQUITOES, YEAR VI
Taylor Paige Wood
Sam Houston High School, Lake Charles, LA

Insect-borne disease is of growing significance around the world. Personal protection from mosquito bites are currently the most important measures to control these diseases. This research investigated the potential of different concentrations of extract from Mexican Marigold, Lemon Grass, Rosemary, and Citrosa plants for their repellency effect against adult female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.<br><br>Plant sample extracts were made from the leaves of each plant into 1, 3, and 5 gram concentrations. The twelve plant extract samples and two commerical plant based repellents, used as a comparison, were tested by means of arm in cage studies, in which the treated arm was inserted into a cage with a fixed number of unfed mosquitoes, and the elapsed time to the first bite is recorded as the duration of protection time.<br><br>The results of the tests conducted revealed that all twelve sample extracts were effective. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used and showed significant differences, P=0.001. A Tukey's mulitiple comparison test was then run to determine specific pairwise differences. The higher concentrations, 5 grams, in each plant exhibited longer protection times. When comparing the commerical plant based repellents with the four plants Rosemary, Mexican Marigold, and Citrosa, 5 grams, provided a longer protection time between 34 minutes to 1 hour 54 minutes.<br><br>The obvious benefits of these plant extracts would provide a natural alternative for public health protection. The significant impact could be worldwide because of existence and substainability of these plants located in various countries where production would possibly be done simply and affordably.

THE BEST BUG BARRIER
Kyle Anthony Kandilian
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the best barrier for containing 3rd and 4th instar Madagascar hissing cockroaches <br><br>(Gromphadorhina portentosa) which relate to the size and weight of most pest species and other climbing species of cockroach. The problem my experiment solved was the discrepancy between the containment abilities of the commonly used cockroach barriers. Ten pieces of the most commonly enclosure materials, acrylic and glass, were coated with a 2.5 cm band of the selected barrier, and 10 cockroaches were tested on each pane of material. The cockroaches were poked in the abdomen and directed toward the barrier until they were 1.25 cm away and either crossed or slipped on the barrier. Pam spray, Crisco, and Bug Stop allowed no cockroaches to pass on acrylic, while Pam spray, Crisco, and Vaseline did the same on glass. In conclusion, the experiment determined which barriers work best and will allow any one working with cockroaches to successfully contain their subjects.

SALINITY TOLERANCE OF THE NEW ZEALAND MUDSNAIL (POTAMOPYRGUS ANTIPODARUM) COLLECTED FROM YOUNG'S BAY, OREGON
Matthew Antony Nugent
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

This study examined the salinity tolerance of the invasive New Zealand Mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) living in Young’s Bay in Astoria, Oregon. By examining which salinities this snail can tolerate, it may be possible to predict locations of future inhabitance. The parthenogenic reproduction of this species is rapid. The independent variables in this project were the different salinities being tested and the dependent variable was the population of New Zealand Mudsnails being tested. The results of the data showed a gradual decrease in the number of snails out of their shells as the salinity level was increased. Over the 35-day testing period, the percentage of snails out of their shells remained high in 3, 5, and 8‰ salinity levels. In 15‰, by day 21, 50% of the snails were out of shell. In 20‰, on day 21, 40% were out of shell and this downward trend continued overall from 25‰ through 35‰ with the exception of 30‰. Salinity level appeared to affect the reproductive output. Reproduction was at its highest level in 8‰ salinity. 72 hours was the maximum tolerance of snails in ocean-level salinity (35‰) in the time trials conducted. Future experimentation could include finding techniques for controlling the spread of this invasive species, genetic analysis of snails to determine origin of the North American population of snails, or examining the growth and survival of offspring.

COLONY EMIGRATION IN APHAENOGASTER OCCIDENTALIS
Sebastian Luke Scofield
Sacred Heart Home School, Hillsboro, OR

The purpose of this project was to discover whether ants of the species Aphaenogaster occidentalis have a consistent pattern of colony emigration, and if so, what that pattern is. The experiments involved inducing emigrations between two artificial nests and counting the number of workers performing several different types of behaviors at five minute intervals as the move was made. These behaviors were: carrying brood to the new nest, returning to the old nest, moving to the new nest, carrying other workers to the new nest, and staying in the new nest. In addition, the time at which the queen moved to the new nest was recorded. Aphaenogaster occidentalis was found to have a definite emigration pattern, which may be divided into three stages: the exploration stage, the brood transport stage, and the adult movement stage. The queen is always moved during the brood transport stage. However, this pattern is slightly different from what I hypothesized: the queen is not as well protected as I expected and adult transport plays a very minor role in colony emigration.

A NOVEL EXTRACTION OF THE PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS FROM PETASITES HYBRIDUS TO CREATE AN ANTISPASMODIC SUPPLEMENT FOR EQUINE COPD
Alexandra Leigh McIe
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY

The root of the plant Petasites hybridus has shown promise in the medical field through its natural production of petasin and isopetasin, which inhibit the synthesis of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase. However, the presence of the naturally occurring pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a hepato-toxin and carcinogen, has hindered the widespread use of Petasites hybridus. A successful method for extracting these alkaloids was developed in order to create an equine supplement targeted at the prevention of COPD and relief of its symptoms. Soxhlet extractions using ethanol as the solvent removed the alcohol- soluble alkaloids, and electrophoresis confirmed retention of petasin and isopetasin. The results of column chromatography were compared to those of the Soxhlet extraction. The chromatography was enhanced with a novel silica sol-gel column that also successfully removed the pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Compared to the Soxhlet extraction, recovery of petasin and isopetasin was significantly reduced in chromatography, suggesting Soxhlet extraction is a preferred purification process. A nebulizer for administering the supplement in severe cases has also been designed.

EXTERNAL SOFTENING OF FOOD MEDIUM BY EXCRETED SALIVA OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER LARVAE
Honami Sakaguchi
Urawa Daiichi Jyoshi High School, Saitama, JAPAN

The surface of the food medium where Drosophila melanogaster larvae are kept gradually becomes wet and softened, while it remains solid in the vial of adult flies. To explain this softening when larvae are present, I carefully observed the behavior of fly larvae and noticed that the larvae vigorously devoured food. I wondered if larvae secrete saliva outside their bodies to soften the food. Experiments were therefore conducted to detect saliva excreted by larvae in the medium and to elucidate its role on digesting food materials in vitro.<br><br> The Iodine Starch Agar Method (ISAM) was first devised. Briefly, the liquid starch-agar gel medium was made violet by adding iodine solution. When larvae were kept on this medium, the color faded gradually and disappeared completely in a few days. It is thus evident that saliva was excreted by larvae on the medium and the amylase in it acted as a catalyzer of starch into simple sugars. <br><br> The ISAM was used again to find out whether fly larvae controlled the secretion of saliva to digest media of varying hardness. It was found that the softer agar media took longer to fade than harder ones. The result strongly suggests that larvae secrete more saliva to feed on harder food. <br><br> The thin layer chromatography further revealed the presence of proteolytic enzymes in the excreted saliva.<br><br> These results suggest that D. melanogaster larvae excrete and control saliva to feed on food efficiently.

PROBIOTIC BACTERIA AS A POTENTIAL CONSERVATION TOOL FOR ENDANGERED AMPHIBIANS
Tara Anjali Adiseshan
Ramana Academy, Charlottesville, VA

Amphibians all over the world are being killed by chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of applying probiotic bacteria to the skin of amphibians to help ameliorate chytridiomycosis, this study has two objectives: (1) visualizing the interactions among amphibian skin, probiotic bacteria, and Bd, by using fluorescent imaging techniques; and (2) studying the long-term survival of probiotic bacteria on the skin of the endangered amphibians, the frog Rana muscosa, and the salamander Plethodon cinersus<br><br> It was hypothesized that probiotic bacteria could be detected on the skin of amphibians two months after application, and interactions between bacteria, Bd, and skin can be visualized. Specimens, such as skin sloughs and foot webbings of amphibians, were stained with propidium iodide (to stain bacteria red) and calcofluor white (to stain fungal cell walls blue), in order to identify the interaction between bacteria and Bd. The ventral skin of amphibian specimens that were exposed to probiotic bacteria, were swabbed two months post-exposure. DNA was extracted from these swabs and amplified by PCR to detect presence of bacterial DNA.<br><br> Both the techniques are new and are on the cutting edge of disease ecology. The fluorescent images distinctly show the interactions between probiotic bacteria and Bd. The presence of bacterial DNA was identified in the exposed specimens. The results from both techniques support the study that probiotic bacteria can be used as a potential conservation tool for amphibians at risk of disease.

RECUSING OUR LAND: FIGHTING INSECT INVASIONS THROUGH A NATURAL REPELLENT
Christopher Alexis Bustos
Uniondale High School, Uniondale, NY

Currently, there is no environmentally safe, cost effective, organic product that will eliminate invasive ant pests and the overuse of synthetic pesticides. This study’s purpose was to obtain alarm pheromones, from the head extracts of Carpenter ants, and utilize it as a repellent on Harvester ants and termites to determine the effect of one alarm pheromone on different social insects. As a result, a “universal” repellent was established that targeted various pests, including termites. Due to the antifungal properties of 4-methyl-3-heptanone, the alarm pheromone also served as a natural “fungicide” on Rhizopus, Erysiphe and Saccharomyces species. <br><br>This year, separate body extractions were performed on Harvester ants to determine the source of their own alarm pheromone and to establish a separate repellent for this colony. Physical observations indicated that the Harvester ants reacted best to their “head” extraction since alarm responses were triggered. Different spectrophotometric readings indicated that the Harvester ants had unique reactions towards each extract as they recognized common chemical compounds found in their alarm pheromone. Therefore, all social insects were repelled by the Carpenter head extracts, as they detected the 4-methyl-3-heptanone found abundantly in their own alarm pheromone. Kirby-Bauer Method tests revealed that the fungi were susceptible to the alarm pheromone, as the zones of inhibitions, in each group set, increased, throughout a five day trial of colony diameter measurements. Data collected supported the idea that ant pheromones can be utilized as an alternative form of pest control and a natural “fungicide” in the near future.

THE WIN-WIN SITUATION IN NATURE: THE MECHANISM OF THE COTTON BOLLWORM COPE WITH THE PLANT DEFENSIVE RESPONSE
Yuan Si
The High School Attached to Shanghai Nomal University, Shanghai, China

Objective: People may consider that plants are too weak to protect themselves. But it is not true, when attacked by insects, plants produce the chemicals harmful to insects, or release the volatiles as signals to warn adjacent plants of the danger. I want to know how the insects cope with the plant defensive response. Method:Using the cotton bollworm, damaged and undamaged tomato and tobacco as the experimental materials, the activity of glutathione(e) S-transferase (GST) and the GSTs gene expression level in cotton bollworm midgut were examined, respectively. Results:1) After being fed on tobacco for 12h and 24h, cotton bollworm midgut GSTs activity was increased 1.5 and 1.9 times, respectively as compared with the control. 2) When fed on the plants that had received the defensive volatile signals from conspecific plant, insect GSTs activity was increased 3 to 7 times, and if fed on heterospecific plants, GSTs activity was increased 2 to 4 times. 3) After receiving plant defensive signals for 12h, insects GSTs activity were increased 1.5 times. 4) When fed with tomato or tobacco pretreated by the exogenous compounds, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and methyl salicylate, GSTs activity was increased 6 to 7 times. 5) The profile of GSTs gene expression in the midgut basically agrees with the changes of the enzyme activity in different treatments. Conclusion:The insects can cope with the plant defensive response by upregulating detoxifying enzyme activity. Both insect and plant benefit themselves from the win-win strategy of co-evolution.

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF SLUG, BI-DAILY AND TRI-DAILY TMR FEEDING ON FIBER OUTPUT OF LACTATING BOVINE FECAL MATTER?
Kadee Sara Esplin
Orion Junior High, Harrisville, UT

Each year dairy farmers are forced out of business due to increased economic and financial pressures. Changing feeding management can help increase the productivity, health and profitability of the dairy cows can help dairies make it in these difficult times. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of slug total mixed ration (TMR) feeding verses bi-daily TMR feeding on the fiber output of lactating bovine fecal matter. The research was conducted on two small operating dairy farms in close proximity in Northern Utah, with similar ration feeding. Feed samples were analyzed for weight and size using a Penn State shaker box. Feed left uneaten was analyzed in the same manner. Fourteen cows from each dairy were randomly selected. Manure samples from each of the cows were taken three times per day at 8 hours intervals. Manure samples of the same volume were washed to harvest the fibrous material. The manure samples were then weighed again. <br><br>Results showed that there was more fiber variation in the cows that were slug fed compared to the cows fed twice a day, implying less consistency in digestion and less nutritional benefit. Based on these results one dairy changed their feeding to three times per day. Upon analysis the data showed that there was much less fiber variation in the manure samples when the cows were fed three times as compared to twice a day. In addition, the percent of fiber by weight decreased as feeding increased implying more efficient digestion.

SEARCHING FOR A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN REPRODUCTION AND STRESS RESISTANCE IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS BY USING LITHIUM CHLORIDE TO INDUCE LONGEVITY
Vipin Tyagi
William L. Dickinson High School, Jersey City, NJ

ABSTRACT<br><br><br> The purpose of this project is to ascertain whether a trade-off exists between reproduction and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans when lithium chloride is applied to induce longevity. When life span is increased, there will be a trade-off present in which there will be a decrease in reproduction rate and an increase in stress resistance in the nematode C. elegans. <br><br> A life span assay was conducted where survival was assessed daily for an increase in life span due to lithium chloride. The reproduction assay tested for any change in reproduction rate where progeny was recorded for all worms in each group at 24 hour intervals. Stress resistance was tested by exposing C. elegans worms to 37ºC (heat stress) and the number of worms living, dead, or lost was recorded every 2 hours. <br><br> An uncorrelated t-Test was conducted at the 0.001 level of significance for life span (t=5.77>3.787; p>0.001) and at the 0.0025 level for stress resistance (t=2.95>2.93; p>0.0025) and reproduction (t=3.41>3.28; p>0.0025). The life span of lithium chloride treated worms was increased to about 37 days. Survival of worms under heat stress was increased from 48 to 60 hours due to treatment. Reproduction rate decreased for the lithium chloride treated worms as mean total progeny production was only 21 while the control group was 60. <br><br> The research hypothesis was fully supported by the data. The results suggest that an increase in life span does come with a price due to the trade-off that occurs and that there is indeed a negative association between longevity and reproduction.

THE EFFECTS OF BOTANICAL COMPOUNDS ON WOUND HEALING AND CELLULAR REGENERATION OF PLANARIA AND PHASMIDS
Jacob Michael Brandvold
Sunnyside High School, Sunnyside, WA

Since the discovery of penicillin by Louis Pasture, society has drifted further and further from the use of natural forms of health care. ? Could it be that our fear of using anything “natural” on our bodies is irrational? After all, the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used honey for wound care for centuries. The purpose of this project was to determine if clover honey, manuka honey, grape seed extract, and ginseng can be used to increase wound healing rates and regeneration in invertebrates. Grape seed extract, ginseng, manuka honey, and clover honey was applied to the leg joints of missing leg of walking sticks and the percentage of leg re-growth and the leg/body growth ratios were recorded. Injured planaria were placed in individual Petri dishes containing distilled water, manuka honey solution, clover honey solution, ginseng extract solution, or grape seed extract solution and the number of days it took for the planaria to heal were recorded. The walking sticks treated with grape seed extract had the highest average leg/body growth ratio, 2.181, as well as the highest average leg re-growth percentage, 85.56%. The planaria treated in the manuka honey solutions healed in an average of 8 days, faster than any of the other planaria. A lot of research is being done right now on manuka honey’s use on wounds in the United States and was recently passed in the United Kingdom and Australia for use by hospitals and doctors as a form of wound treatment.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: A ROBOTIC SIMULATION OF PREDATOR-PREY CO-EVOLUTION
Carlie Alexandra Scalesse
London Central Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

Behavioural evolution has been a topic of much interest within the scientific field. However, difficulties that arise during the study of the biological evolution of complex organisms, namely its duration, have made studying this an unwieldy process virtually impossible to study in real time. As such, science has turned to artificial life in order to simulate this lengthy process in a shorter time frame. This project aims at determining the efficiency of evolutionary robotics in reproducing the behavioural evolution in a predator-prey co-evolutionary dynamic. Analysis of the results demonstrates that, as hypothesized, an arms race has developed between the predator and prey populations. This arms race lead to the development of actual behaviours used by various species of biological predators. Using evolutionary robotics, a realistic simulation of predator-prey co-evolution has been created. This process can therefore be applied to the study of macro and micro evolution either to better understand evolution, or even to predict it.

PHOCA HISPIDA FEEDING ECOLOGY AND CONTAMINANT UPTAKE: INSIGHTS FROM ELEMENTAL ANALYSES OF CLAWS
Elizabeth Olson Ferreira
Fort Richmond Collegiate, Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA

Phoca hispida (ringed seal) claws contain up to seven visible annular growth rings (annuli) that reflect a longer timeline of contaminant exposure compared to visceral tissue. This study assessed the potential of analyzing sections of Phoca hispida claws (n=12) to determine total mercury body burden in relation to muscle tissue. Mercury concentrations in the claws and muscle tissue were analyzed using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). Stable isotopes of nitrogen (15N/14N) were determined using continuous flow ion mass spectroscopy (CFIR-MS). Positive linear relationships were detected between log10[Hg] in the base of the claws versus d15N values in muscle tissue; and d15N values in the base of the claws versus log10[Hg] in the muscle tissue. This study confirmed the use of claws as a tool in communicating overall mercury body burden in Phoca hispida.

Tuvale James Polu
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

Two phases of study were undertaken to determine the efficiency of three methods of mosquito biocontrol: copepods, plant extracts, and salt tolerance.The first phase included the use of copepods, or aquatic crustaceans that have been reported to possess predation on mosquito larvae. Experiments for copepods were conducted under laboratory and natural conditions. The collection of copepods used during the present study was identified and confirmed as Mesocyclops aspericornis. This was the first report of this particular species in American Samoa. Results from different sets of lab experiments in this phase showed a difference in predation rates, which is likely linked to various factors such as, larvae size, copepod size, and container size. Field trials with copepod treatments showed a deduction in mosquito larvae as compared to the prepared control. A relationship between the number of copepods and survival of mosquito larvae was observed. <br><br> The second phase included the use of Century Plant (Agave americana) aqueous leaf extracts and salt tolerance. A combination of both test materials was also tested. Century Plant concentrations included 156.25 ppm, 312.5 ppm, 625 ppm, 1250 ppm, 2500 ppm, 5000 ppm, 10000 ppm, and 20000 ppm. Saline concentrations included 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, and 0.7% salinity. Field experiments were also carried out for Century Plant aqueous extracts. All experiments for Century Plant and salt tolerance were replicated at least 5 times. High mortality rates were produced for the highest concentrations of Century Plant extract, and saline solutions. The combination of both test materials of Century Plant leaf extracts and saline solutions produced high mortality rates as a synergistic effect.<br><br> It was evident from the present study that the first phase proved that copepods were a clear predator to Ae. polynesiensis mosquito larvae. The second phase provided evidence of the efficacy of Century Plant and salt tolerance in combination against Ae. polynesiensis. The present study provided that copepods, Century Plant extracts, and salt tolerance are promising biocontrol agents against Ae. polynesiensis.

MORPHOLOGICAL VARIANCES BETWEEN CEUTHOPHILIS CONICAUDUS AND CEUTHOPHILIS CARLSBADENSIS IN EDDY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO
Sabrina Christine Jerlean Michael
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

Using two previous years' data, I continued observing Ceuthophilis conicaudus and Ceuthophilis carlsbadensis. My purpose was to test for speciation by using physical characteristics. In an effort to determine whether or not speciation was likely, I conducted an analysis of morphological features to determine if further DNA analysis was warranted. I went to six different caves and collected two different cave cricket species. I went in the same month, during daylight, and I used a caliper and ruler to measure their antennae length, head capsule width, hind leg length, body length, and ovipositor (if female.) I observed around the same time, within one months' time period, same amount of crickets measured (30 of each species, 15 female and 15 male,) and same measuring methods. My variable was distance (how far apart the caves were.) Statistical analysis reveals a significant difference in Ceuthophilis carlsbadensis lengths of hind leg, antennae, ovipositor, body, and head capsule width, supporting my hypothesis and indicating possible speciation for Ceuthophilis conicaudus, statistics support a significant difference in body, hind leg, and left antennae length. However, for Ceuthophils conicaudus, the head capsule width and ovipositor length had possibilities of being similar. DNA analysis will be done to verify that speciation is occurring, seeing that evidence points towards that.

RODENT RHYTHMS: THE EFFECT OF LIGHT DEPRIVATION ON CIRCADIAN CYCLES
Breann Marie Pinley
Latta High School, Ada, OK

Circadian rhythms are contributing factors in determining sleeping and feeding patterns of animals. Rodents contain unique circadian rhythms due to their nocturnal nature. The purpose of this project was to investigate whether the circadian rhythms in rodents shift from their innate customary 24 hour light/dark cycle when exposed to extended periods of absolute darkness. The null hypothesis was no change in the circadian rhythm of rodents will occur while subjected to extended periods of complete darkness. The research hypothesis was that when rodents are placed in continual total darkness there would be a shift in the rodent’s circadian rhythm from the original 24 hour sleep/activity patterns to longer sleep/activity cycles. <br><br> After being acclimated to 12 hour alternating light/dark cycles, experimental rodents were placed in darkness for 14 days and their activity recorded with a computer-linked sensor. Control rodents remained in the 12 hour alternating light/dark conditions. To analyze rodent activity periods, blocks were shaded on a spreadsheet that represented wheel-running episodes. In each of the animals their periods of activity shifted forward, but some shifted more slowly than others. The shift change ranged from 0.63 hours/day to 1 hour/day. In addition, greater hours of activity were observed as the time of darkness progressed. Due to the observed shift and increase in the hours of activity, the research hypothesis was supported. This project verified that light is very important in the establishment of an organism’s internal biological rhythms.

AROMATIC EFFECTS ON CALORIE-RESTRICTED GRYLLUS BIMACULATUS
Jeannie Nguyen Tran
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Caloric restriction, limiting an organism’s calorie consumption, can increase certain organisms’ lifespan. Many scientists hope that understanding caloric restriction may provide clues to slowing the aging process in humans, but recent studies in fruit flies have shown that olfactory stimulants may diminish caloric restriction’s life-lengthening effect. Some scientists believe that only the odors of foods that the particular organism enjoys will harm the effect of caloric restriction. The objective of this experiment was to test a set of olfactory stimulants and their effects on caloric restriction in Gryllus bimaculatus (a species of field crickets) and deepen the understanding of when and how caloric restriction might prolong lifespan. The hypothesis was that the odors of foods that crickets are regularly attracted to would diminish caloric restriction’s life-lengthening effect. <br><br> In this experiment, crickets under various conditions were raised over a period of four months. Crickets on a calorie-restricted diet and not exposed to any of the tested olfactory stimulants were found to have a lifespan that was 22 days longer on average when compared to the control group. Most of the olfactory stimulants tested dramatically shortened the average lifespan of crickets on calorie-restricted diets. This experiment provides data that odors may have a significant effect on caloric restriction. Further study of the olfactory system could lead to underlying mechanism that causes lifespan extension in calorie-restricted organisms and could answer the question as to how caloric restriction can be used for humans’ advantage.

COPING WITH COPEPODS: PREY PREFERENCE AND THE FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE TO SUBOPTIMAL LIGHTING AND TEMPERATURE BY THE OMNIVOROUS COPEPOD MACROCYCLOPS ALBIDUS
Madeleine Amanda Ball
Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Dallas, TX

Macrocyclops albidus were evaluated for predatory preference and functional response under adverse lighting and temperature conditions such as those occurring during spring and fall with a goal of assessing copepod’s viability for use in year round mosquito abatement, with an end goal of West Nile Virus vector control. The hypothesis was that when copepods are exposed to sub-optimal environmental conditions they are less likely to select mosquito larvae as prey, thereby reducing their effectiveness as year round mosquito control. <br><br> Static bioassays were performed exposing mature, non gravid, copepods to 1st instar Aedes aegypti larvae, algae and leaf litter. Tested variables included, prey density, temperature and lighting. Bioassays were also performed under optimal conditions for comparison purposes. A chi squared test was used to determine if variations in results were statistically significant. <br><br> Results partially supported the hypothesis; copepods consumed fewer larvae under adverse light and temperature conditions, but still preferred larvae over other food sources. Temperatures 10-20° below optimal reduced prey encounter, attack and consumption rates by 15-19% overall. Adverse light reduced consumption 14-30%. However when offered a multi-prey diet copepods killed 85% of available larvae within 48 hours regardless of temperature or light. Further as prey decreased over time, rates of consumption slowed up to 12% under adverse conditions. Results demonstrated that copepods prefer larvae despite sub-optimal environmental parameters, however the deviation between copepod performance under optimal vs. suboptimal conditions was statistically significant. Copepods, while useful for larvae bio-control, will take longer to manage larvae populations.

BIOCONTROL POTENTIAL OF FIVE FRESHWATER DECAPODS FOR A POLYSPECIFIC TREMATODE VECTOR SNAIL (THIARIDAE: MELANOIDES TUBERCULATA)
Alexander Mee-Woong Kim
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

This project quantified predation rates by three species of freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium amazonicum, Mac. carcinus, and Mac. crenulatum) and two of Cambarid crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Orconectes rusticus) on three size divisions of the widely invasive trumpet snail, Melanoides tuberculata. It was hypothesized that increased concentrations of these snails would result in a diminution of consumption rates, that the smallest snails would be preferentially consumed, and that snail aperture length would be positively correlated with shell strength and snail mass.<br><br> Phase I: Mel. tuberculata snails were divided on the basis of shell aperture length into small (0-2 mm), medium (2-4 mm), and large (4-6 mm) size divisions. At initial density, two snails from each division were acclimated to each predator's individual aquarium, and mortality rates were compared against those of no-predator control setups after 24 hours. Phase II: Mortality rates were analyzed for snails similarly provided to Phase I's most effective predator (Mac. carcinus) at twice and five times original density. Phase III: The relationship between snail shell strength, snail mass, and aperture length was analyzed.<br><br> It was determined that consumption rates varied significantly amongst the assessed species (in order of decreasing predatory efficiency, Mac. carcinus, O. rusticus, Mac. crenulatum, Mac. amazonicum, P. clarkii). Selective preference for the smallest snail size class was detected for all species but the highly efficacious Mac. carcinus, for which snail consumption remained essentially total despite doubling and quintupling of snail density. Snail aperture length was positively correlated with both shell strength and snail mass.

EFFECTS OF INFUSION DURATION ON THE ACQUISITION OF COCAINE ADMINISTRATION
Kevin Thornton
Miller Grove High School, Lithonia, GA

Purpose: Studies have shown that the rate of drug onset does alter the subjective effects of cocaine and morphine in humans as well as non-human primates during maintenance. Previous studies in rats have shown little evidence of duration effects due to cocaine self-administration. The goal of this study is to investigate a procedure in rats that might be more sensitive to duration effects. We hypothesize that rats prefer shorter, to longer, injections.<br><br>Results: Most rats were sensitive to the duration of infusion. Once rats acquired their responses, duration had little influence on their decision between the cues associated with fast and slow pumps. <br><br>Conclusions: Rats preferred the faster infusion during the acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Rats consistently chose the cue associated with the fast pump. These results indicate that, like primates, rats are sensitive to the infusion duration, with self-administration being more rapidly acquired with shorter infusion duration. The failure to observe this effect in previous studies may be related to the use of maintenance, rather than acquisition, procedures in those studies. This research will provide answers about drug-related environmental cues and basic behavioral processes in rats that can be applied to alternative models. The findings of this research will ultimately provide various treatments in combating drug addiction such as a step down drug which will mitigate most of the withdraw effects of addictive subtances.

THE EFFECTS OF CAMELLIA SINENSIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOMBYX MORI PUPAE
Peter Bau
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

The main purpose of this experiment was to test if the tea brewed from the Camellia sinensis plant would have a positive effect on pupae development. Many hypotheses were formed, but the two main hypotheses formulated stated that the tea would decrease the time it took to reach pupation, and that the mortality of the silkworms will be higher than the control. Green, oolong, and black tea were brewed from the Camellia sinensis, and groups of 50 silkworms each were exposed to one particular tea. One group of 50 silkworms that were not exposed to tea acted as a control group. The 40 mL of tea were dropped into their respective groups. This process was repeated until they began to pupate. There were many results obtained from this experiment. Both of the stated hypotheses were able to be accepted, since the silkworms that were exposed to tea reached each instar (molt) faster than the control. Also, four silkworms in the control group died, as opposed to the tea group which experienced no losses. This was a surprising result because all of the silkworms grew under the same conditions, and human contact was kept to a minimum as bateria could have spread, even though latex gloves were being used. An interesting result that was obtained was that 14 of the silkworms that were exposed to black tea experienced a slight color change in pupae color from the normal bright white to a off white/light tan color.

CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE BIOENERGETICS MODEL FOR CHINOOK SALMON (ONCORHYCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA)
Nicholas Wolf Parker
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

In winter, juvenile salmon reduce food intake and hide to avoid predators. I hypothesized that basic metabolism would utilize the highest proportion of chinook energy consumption. I created a comprehensive bioenergetics model for chinook salmon. Fish use energy in three ways: growth, activity/metabolism, and waste. To calculate energy allocated to growth I measured the energy (Joules) consumed by the fish each day (260.8 J/g/day). Using a preexisting coho model, I calculated the energy put into growth in J/g/day. The energy consumed divided by the energy allocated to growth gave the amount of energy ingested being used for growth, 14.8%. To analyze the amount of energy used for activity/metabolism I withheld food from the fish and measured weight loss. This displayed the routine metabolism over wintering chinook salmon. The observed average was 58 J/g/day. I calculated standard metabolic cost (SMR) by examining oxygen consumption. The cost was 11% of it's daily intake. Dividing the J/g/day left over after subtracting off the SMR displayed the daily amount needed for activity, around 11.2%. Waste must then account for 63% of energy consumption. This data does not support my hypothesis. <br><br>This Bioenergetics model allowed me to show that in winter when salmon feed there growth efficiency is very low. Other applications of bioenergetics models allow researchers to calculate how much prey Chinook consume, or how much they will grow on a fixed diet. Researchers could also determine the amount of days without food salmon could survive before they began using up muscle for energy.

TRAIT OF LADYBUG'S ELYTRA PROTECTED LADYBUG FROM TIGER BEETLE
Ye Muk Choi
Chungnam Science High School, Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do, Chungcheongnam-do, SOUTH KOREA

The purpose of this research is to find the reason why tiger beetles can't eat lady bugs, through the visual observation of the surface of the elytra and size of ladybugs and its body shape.<br><br>It was hypothesized that; <br><br>There is a little microstructure which makes friction in the ladybug's elytra compared to other insects. Punctate in the ladybug's elytra size is small and frequency is low. The structure of seta in the ladybug's elytra cause low friction. The size of ladybug's elytra is not too small that the tiger beetle can easily bite it. The body shape of the ladybug is so round that the tiger beetle can't bite.<br><br>I observed the relationship of beetles and I found that tiger beetle can't eat ladybugs I think it is because friction of ladybug's elytra. The test this I measured the friction and I found that the friction of ladybug's elytra is low. I observed the microstructure with SEM, which can cover a wider surface, and AFM which can measure depth. As a result of this observation I confirmed that there is no punctate striae and interstice in the ladybug's elytra while all others have them, confirmed that the ladybug's elytra has small size and low frequency, and I found that the height of seta of ladybug's elytra is smaller than the depth of punctate because it is lying.<br><br>I considered another reason because some of the ladybugs were eaten by tiger beetles even though the friction of its elytra is low. I decided to observe the size of these ladybugs' body. Most ladybug's size is not too small that tiger beetle can easily bite, but some of them is not. I observed the body shape of ladybugs. The body shape of ladybugs is round and makes it difficult fot most tiger beetles bite.<br><br>From this research, I know that tiger beetles can't eat ladybugs and I found that the friction of ladybug's elytra is low because it has no punctate striae and interstice. I also learned its microstructure has low frequency and small size and its seta is lying sideways. I found that the size of ladybug's elytra is not too small that tiger beetle can easily bite and body shape of ladybug is round so that tiger beetle can't bite. So tiger beetles can't bite ladybugs because the mandible of tiger beetles slide on the elytra surface.

NO FEET, NO HORSE!
Estelle Simon
Ecole Secondaire Fernand-Lefebvre, Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, CANADA

Traditional horseshoes installation was invented to minimize the wear on horse’s hooves. This method however has some limitation and risks besides requiring the needs of a professional. The goal of my project was to create a composite horseshoe that will not require nailing through the hoof and that anybody could install in an emergency.<br><br>The first prototype was fabricated of polyurethane/ fiberglass/epoxy horseshoe, but it was not a good combination of materials because the polyurethane proved to be too flexible under the weight of the horse. This prototype was replaced by one model made of biaxial Kevlar/epoxy which was more rigid. The result was a 0.090 kg rigid Kevlar/epoxy horseshoe that was bounded to the outside of the hoof with epoxy resin. This is a major improvement since a traditional metallic horseshoe for the same horse weighted 0.416 kg. <br><br> Four Kevlar horseshoes with studs were installed on November 17Th, 2007 on my horse. Daily routine inspections were performed and noted in my project data book after each regular exercise. The horseshoes performed well until the beginning of the fifth week where the horseshoes started to show structural failures. The Kevlar horseshoes started braking at the stud’s area where Kevlar material was removed to thread the studs and therefore weakened the horseshoes. <br><br>I was able to succeed in the construction of an efficient, light and safe composite horseshoe with unique characteristics and which does not require nailing for its installation. A horsemen once told me “no feet, no horse”!

EFFECT OF PROTEIN ON GRYLLIDAE DEVELOPMENT
Emily Victoria Simmons
Xavier College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

Gryllidae, or “true crickets”, affect the condition of ecosystems. They serve as nutritious and essential prey to many carnivores, but may also lead to economic destruction through damage to crops. This makes it essential to understand how the consumption of different nutrients affects their survival. This experiment sought to determine the impact that an increase in protein in a cricket’s diet would have on the metamorphic cycle (in particular weight gain and molting) of pinhead crickets. It is believed that if protein influences the average weight of a cricket, then a difference would be observed in the weight of crickets exposed to 80% soy protein powder.<br><br> In the experiment, six cages with ten pinhead crickets were fed carrots and lettuce, three of which received supplemental protein. Every two days, the average weight per cricket and the number of moltings were determined. In the experiment, it was determined that the crickets with extra protein in their diet gained 97.82% more of their original weight as compared to the crickets fed solely on vegetables. In fact, the control group stopped gaining weight for the last six days while the experimental group continued to gain weight. The experimental group exhibited eight more moltings than the control group. Overall, protein appeared to increase cricket activity level, growth, and development. If crickets were to be exposed to large supplements of protein, it could be disastrous. Crickets may be able to eat more than an ecosystem, or an artificial system such as a cropland, could sustain.

OPTIMAL FROG SIZE, BAR POSITION AND CENTER SULCUS CORRECTION FOR THE HOOVES OF EQUUS CABALLUS
Megan Angeline Strube
Trinity High School, Dickinson, ND

One of the most important parts of movement for Equus caballus is its hoof. Traditional methods of trimming suggest that the hoof wall should bear the weight of the animal. However, a new theory suggests that the whole foot should bear the weight in a mthod devised to mimic wild mustang feet. The purpose of this experiment was to observe the affects of different trimming methods. The goal was to find the method that corrects frog size, bar position, and opens the center sulcus as these parts of the hoof are critical to function, comfort, and health of the animal.<br><br>12 animals/48 hooves were observed. The animals were split into three groups. The Traditional Group contained 4 horses trimmed using the traditional method. The Natural Group contained 4 horses beginning the natural method; measured at 0 weeks and 6 weeks. The Natural Maintained Group contained 4 horses that have been trimmed in the natural method for at least 6 months. Measurements and photos of frog size and bar length were taken for all of the hooves in all of the groups. The center sulcus was also recorded open or closed. Terrain, feed, climate, and nutrition were constant for all animals.<br><br>Based on the data, the Natural Maintained Group had more proportionate frog size, the bar length was correct, and the center sulcus was open in almost all of the hooves when compared to the Traditional Goup. The horses in the Natural Group showed positive progress after only 6 weeks. After analyzing results based on measurement, visual correctness, and behavior, it can be concluded that the natural method of trimming corrects errors in frog size, bar position, and the center sulcus.

In my project, I was trying to find out which substance repels pheasants from corn seed. I tested four chemicals on the corn seed which includes: BirdShield, garlic spray, generic grape pop, one hundred percent grape juice.<br><br>I set out the corn seed in piles, and then I sprayed them with each of my substances. I weighed each pile of corn seed. Then I weighed them after a few days to see how much corn had been eaten. I also set out two game cameras, which would take pictures to help give evidence to my results.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF POULTRY GROWTH ENHANCERS & DIGESTIVE BY-PRODUCTS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Adam Lee Muehler
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To determine which feed supplement enhances the growth rate of turkeys. Secondly, investigate the bacterial content of the turkey's fecal matter. Next, ascertain the effects of turkey feces on the overall growth of two corn cultivars. Finally, to see if turkey manure could be deemed an all around fertilizer for agricultural use.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Randomly selected 75 tom turkeys out of a 10,000 bird flock and separated them into three 25 bird groups (Control Feed, BioSupreme G, DiaMune Se)<br><br>BI-MONTHLY WEIGHTS: Monitored the weight gain of each bird, once every two weeks, during an eight week testing period. Then completed a feed conversion to feasibly evaluate the study.<br><br>BACTERIA COLONIZATION: Weekly monitored the number of Escherichia coli and Salmonella colonies found in the feces of each group.<br><br>TEST PLOT STUDY: Compared two cultivars of corn for plant height, corn cob circumference, corn cob length, seed count, test weight, bushels per acre, moisture content, protein content, oil content, and starch content, while using turkey manure as a natural fertilizer to compare it against commercial fertilizers.<br><br>SOIL TESTING: Analyzed soil samples from each of the three plots (Control, Turkey Manure, and Commercial) before and after the fertilizers were applied.<br><br>CONCLUSION: After observing all aspects of my study, I found that DiaMune Se was the most superior supplement, and that the Turkey Manure was the most economically efficient fertilizer. Based upon these findings, I believe natural growth enhancers can be used as effective poultry supplements and that turkey by-products can be used as a progressive alternative in agricultural production.

THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIBIOTICS IN MARINE SPONGES ON NON-PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
Bernadette Ann Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

New antibiotics need to be discovered because modern bacteria are developing resistance to established antibiotics. The number of cases of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, has risen each year indicating a need to develop other antibiotics. Natural antibiotics have been discovered in marine sponges. I designed an experiment to test the antibiotic properties of three species of marine sponges: Pink Sponge, Darwinella mulleri, Blue Sponge, Dysidea camera, and Yellow Ball Sponge, Cinachyra alloclada, on commercial non-pathogenic and marine bacteria. I performed this experiment by extracting marine bacteria and natural antibiotic from sponge tissues. To test the antibiotics, I cultured the marine bacteria, and commercial non-pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis with the prepared antibiotic discs. <br><br> <br><br>This experiment proved that natural compounds from the marine sponges inhibited the growth of both the marine bacteria and the non-pathogenic commercial bacteria. The extracts from all three sponges affected both bacteria, demonstrating visible zones of inhibition. It is probable this inhibition is a result of the natural marine antibiotic produced by the symbiotic microbes living in the sponge. It is significant that these three marine sponge antibiotics inhibited the Staphylococcus epidermidis, establishing a link for a potential antibiotic for MRSA, a Staphylococcal infectious bacteria. This is critical to research because modern bacteria are developing resistance to established antibiotics. If antibiotics found in these marine sponges are further isolated and developed, this could widen possibilities for the medical world.

A HAIRY SITUATION: INVESTIGATING THE SENSORY FUNCTIONS OF INTEROMMATIDIAL BRISTLES IN D. MELANOGASTER
Cynthia Wambui Irungu
Burlington Township High School, Burlington, NJ

This project in its present form is the result of stimulatory testing towards exploring the function of interommatidial bristles in the eye of Drosophila melanogaster. It was hypothesized that the bristles provide sensory input during the eye-cleaning behavior of the highly sensitive compound eye. <br><br>The role of the mechanoreceptors was determined by using both a mechanical and a controlled electrical stimulus. Three mutant eye clones were used in this study. These mutants were specifically targeted for mutations affecting the bristle phenotype. The initial preparation utilized a single camel hair brush as a stimulatory medium. The second preparation employed an electrical stimulus controlled by a variable resistor. The latter method induced a significant rate of response (>65%) and proved that the interommatidial bristles were responsible for providing sensory input for the eye-cleaning behavior. By using the revised methodology, a defined threshold for response was also determined.

IS MITOCHONDRIAL D-LOOP ANALYSIS SUFFICIENT TO DETECT BLACK ANGUS BEEF?
Seung-eun Jang
PAUL R WHARTON HIGH SCHOOL, Tampa, FL

This research involved Mitochondrial d-loop DNA, which is known for its fast mutation rate. The fast mutation rate enables the analysis between breeds of cows, since the variability would be more apparent in these regions. <br><br>- The questions being addressed in this research were: Can the analysis of Mitochondrial d-loop DNA sequence of beef be used to verify the authenticity of “Black Angus Beef” sold at the local grocery stores? Can one determine the percentage of relatedness on samples of beef, indicating its relatedness to “Angus”?<br><br>- The problem of this project was to determine whether modern molecular technologies can be used to confirm breeds of beef.<br><br>- The procedures used for this project were the following protocols: DNA extraction of beef samples, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), Electrophoresis, Gel purification, Cloning, Mini prep, Sequencing, and Data Analysis.<br><br>- Upon the analysis of the DNA sequences, the researcher was able to determine that the beef sample was indeed not from pure Angus cattle. BLAST analysis showed that the sample d-loop DNA sequence was most similar to that of Korean beef sample (93%). The MEGA analysis showed that the sample was 80% similar to Angus beef sample. The results confirmed the hypothesis, which stated: If we sequence the mitochondrial d-loop DNA gene from various tissue samples, then we can determine what breeds the tissues came from. Modern molecular technologies can confirm the breeds of beef.

EXTENDING LONGEVITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Emily Elizabeth Thomas
Dixie Middle School, St. George, UT

The purpose of my experiment was to find, out of five nutrients, which would best extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly. The procedure I followed was as such, I prepped six bottles of equal volume(i.e. washed with bleach, given the same control medium, given a bamboo skewer and a paper towel as to provide a resting place for the flies and to avoid unnecessary death through drowning) and then I added to five of the bottles the variable pertaining to them, Biochavan, Acetyl-L-Carnitine with Alpha Lipoic Acid (my hypothesized winner), Resveratrol, Sibu, and Greens to Go (1/2 of a teaspoon for the liquid, Sibu, and 1/4 of a teaspoon for the powders and gel.) To each of the bottles, I added thirteen flies. I then waited fifteen days to observe the results until the time the second generation hatched. At the end of the fifteen days, Greens to Go had ten flies still alive, the control had nine along with Acetyl-L-Carnitine, but with the latter, I noted that they did not have nearly the amount of eggs, pupa, or larva that the other variables had. Biochavan had eight flies and in Resveratrol and Sibu, only five flies remained alive. The conclusion I reached was quite surprising as only one of my variables did better than the control. Apparently it’s important to stress diversity in a diet as Greens to Go offered different types of powdered vegetables and that Acetyl-L-Carnitine may have contraceptive effects on flies.

EQUINE LEARNING PATTERNS
Anna Barfod Lidofsky
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

This project was designed to test the importance of age, gender, and personality in equine learning. The initial hypotheses were that female, older, and aloof or challenging horses would learn more quickly than male, younger, and social or fearful horses.<br><br>A model of visual learning and problem solving was used to test these hypotheses. The time was measured for a horse to identify a colored bucket that contained an apple as a reward from two other differently colored buckets. Each trial was performed in an enclosed area and repeated four times. The buckets were in different sequences for each trial, yet the apple always remained in the same bucket. Sixteen horses were tested.<br><br>The variances of the groups were significantly different when comparing the ratio of the improvement (completion of the last trial time divided by completion of the first trial time) between females and males, older horses and younger horses, and social horses and challenging horses. This was done by using the F-test. The variances also were significantly different when comparing the first trial results between the social and aloof horses and also the first trial results between the social and challenging horses. The means of the social group compared to the aloof group were approaching statistical significance, and should more horses be tested in the future, it is likely they would become statistically significant. This was done by using the t-test.<br><br>The results suggest that the pattern of training should be adjusted for gender, age, and personality.

THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF ETHANOL ON FRUIT FLIES
John Philip Creamer
Jefferson High School - 9th Grade Complex, Shenandoah Junction, WV

The purpose of my project was to discern the long-term impact of ethanol on fruit flies by using population counts. I also observed the time it took for the flies to lay eggs, turn into larva, turn into pupa, and hatch as adult fruit flies. Another feature I decided to observe was how long it took for each sample to die off from either alcohol related problems or resource depletion. Research has shown that fruit flies can survive on fermented fruit. I hypothesized that a moderate amount of alcohol in the medium would cause the flies to reproduce the fastest, have the highest population, and have the longest colony life span. The group that had the highest average count was Population B (1.88% ethanol) at roughly 60 flies. Population B was the first to complete a growth cycle averaged at day 11. Population B also had the longest colony life span, 46 days on average. However, Population C (2.82% ethanol) had 2 vials with as many flies as B or, in the case of one of the vials, better than Population B. The third vial in Population C died early and had a low population. The results provide some support for my hypothesis, but are insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Lack of control over gender when transporting the flies to their vials and the fact that some of the flies may have died from the rough transport could have impacted the results.

THE EFFECT OF HONEYBEE PATHOGENS ON HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H2O2) CONTENT AND GLUCOSE OXIDASE ACTIVITY IN HONEY
Lydia Louise McCormick
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, AL

Honey bees are the world’s number one pollinator and, therefore, essential in our economy because plants depend on them for reproduction. Unfortunately, numerous devastating disorders and parasites plague hives such as small hive beetle, varroa, chalkbrood, and american foulbrood. And, quite recently, a world wide catastrophe called colony collapse cisorder (CCD) is baffling beekeepers everywhere. While beekeepers may resort to chemical treatments, honey bees have natural defenses in their honey. These antibacterial properties include it’s acidic pH, high osmolarity , and hydrogen peroxide content. Honey bees secrete the enzyme glucose oxidase into honey; it reacts with glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide. <br><br> The hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide content and glucose oxidase activity will be higher in honey from healthy hives compared to infected colonies was tested. Thirty-nine raw honey samples were collected from Alabama beekeepers in ten counties as well as Florida, Pennsylvania and India. Six commercial honeys were also tested for comparison. Two experiments were conducted using colorimetric assays to measure hydrogen peroxide and glucose oxidase activity. Surprisingly, infected honey had 18% higher hydrogen peroxide levels then healthy honey. Although, not supported statistically, there were obvious trends in the data wherein H2O2 concentrations were higher in honey from diseased hives or in the same apiaries. The glucose oxidase experiments showed varying low levels without definite differences between healthy and infected. Finally, commercial samples had the lowest H2O2 content and glucose oxidase. All in all, the results may lead to a new chemical method to predict colony stress from infection.

THE ONION THRIP TRICK: THE HETERORHABDITIS BACTERIOPHORA NEMATODE AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT FOR THRIPS TABACI
Lindsey McLaren Denison
Paonia High School, Paonia, CO

“The Onion Thrip Trick” experiment’s objective is to determine whether the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is an effective alternative biological control agent for Thrips Tabaci. T.tabaci is a parasitic insect that often targets onions as a host. Once it infects the onion, T.tabaci pierces the epidermal cells of the onion causing photosynthesis to cease, which results in severe discoloration of the onion leaves. Onion cells infected by T.tabaci turn the plant tissue of the onion white, making the crop highly unmarketable, and the crop’s over all yields can be reduced by up to 60%. The researcher hypothesized that onion crops infested with T.tabaci could be treated with the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora as a biological control agent as opposed to synthetic pesticides. The researcher tested the effects of H.bacteriophora on T.tabaci in both lab and field trials. In the lab trials, H. bacteriophora killed at least 90% of all thrips in all tests. H.bacteriophora caused a mortality rate of at least 30% in all test plots in the greenhouse trial. The data from this experiment confirms that H. abcteriophora nematodes are a reliable alternative to synthetic pesticides and could be implemented into integrated pest management programs for treating onion crops infested with T.tabaci onion thrips.

THE ROLE OF MATERNAL EFFECTS AND MATERNALLY-TRANSMITTED ENDOSYMBIONTS IN THE DIET RESTRICTION RESPONSE IN FRUIT FLIES
Yihe Dong
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

This study focuses on the mechanism through which the effects of diet restriction (DR) are inherited through generations. First, nutrient availability to each hatching fly is controlled by controlling egg density. Over 4000 eggs of DR and R diet parents are collected and distributed at equal density. Longevity, oxidative, and starvation stress resistance are measured to test offspring quality.<br><br>Kaplan Meier estimate and log-rank test show that the same phenomenon is observed with egg density control as without, indicating that egg density does not cause maternal effects inheritance. <br><br>The second, molecular-level approach employs the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. Both Wolbachia and DR are maternally inherited and are found to affect the insulin receptor (InR) pathway. First, DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis are run to test for Wolbachia in four different strains. After flies are exposed to DR and R diet, the longevity, stress resistance, nutrient uptake, fitness, and resource allocation response are measured in the presence and absence of Wolbachia in over 11,000 flies.<br><br>T-tests indicate that there is no difference between DR and R diet fly fecundity in the absence of Wolbachia, while a significant difference exists in Wolbachia positive flies across all four strains. At the same time, while there is no difference in stress resistance between R diet Wolbachia positive and negative flies, there is a significant elevation of stress resistance in three of the four strains under DR. These data indicate that Wolbachia increases the differences between DR and R diet flies, while DR increases the difference between Wolbachia positive and negative flies. <br><br>Consequently, an interaction exists between DR and Wolbachia through the insulin receptor pathway. This observation is significant in revealing not just how maternal effects are inherited, but also the important link between DR and lifespan extension. The conclusions can be applicable in other organisms, including humans, as they have homologs to the InR pathway.

POPULATION GENETIC DIVERSITY OF AKULE IN HAWAIIAN WATERS
Gideon Napomaikaiapau Logan
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI

Population genetic diversity of Akule (Selar crumenophthalmus) was investigated by finding DNA markers of diversity. One hundred sixty seven individuals representing five different schools from varying geographic origins were studied, and diversity was examined between geographic populations. After DNA extraction, the mitochondrial loci ND1 and 16s rRNA, and genomic locus Aldolase B was amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).<br><br> A total of 11 restriction enzymes were used to digest the PCR products at the loci ND1, Aldolase B and 16s rRNA. At each locus, many enzymes had recognition sites and subsequent bands were formed after agarose gel electrophoresis. The Ava II digestion at the ND1 locus revealed varying patterns of digestion, which was used to construct a differing haplotye within forty six of the individuals. The difference in proportion of individuals who had the different haplotye created by the results of the Ava II digestion at ND1 was then tested for statistical significance. The two sample z-Test for the difference between proportions concluded with 99.98% confidence that populations Waianae and Barber’s Point demonstrated an inherited difference in proportion of fish with differing haplotypes from populations in Hauula and Niihau, all locations around the main Hawaiian Islands. This difference in proportion was inherited and not by random. Akule are much more localized and are becoming reproductively isolated. This doesn’t imply that populations of fish from Waianae and Barber’s Point cannot reproduce with fish from Hauula and Niihau but implies that populations are not reproducing with each other and are undergoing subspeciation.

ANALYSIS OF THE WESTERN ARCTIC CARIBOU HERD'S SPRING MIGRATION
Reid Joseph Magdanz
Kotzebue High School, Kotzebue, AK

Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are an important food source for people in northern Alaska and play a prominent role in local economies. This study focused on the 500,000-animal Western Arctic Caribou Herd, which migrates from the Seward Peninsula and upper Kobuk valley to the North Slope and back each year. In recent years, the timing of the herd’s migrations has changed, but the reasons for these shifts are not well understood.<br><br>The purpose of this study was to determine if any association existed between ambient air temperatures and the timing of the spring migration of the Western Arctic Herd. This study utilized 1043 caribou locations from March though June, 2000-2007. The caribou data was collected from satellite collars placed on 62 members of the herd and had been previously acquired for purposes other than this study. Temperature data for the same period came from an online database. Graphs of caribou latitude with temperature and change in latitude with temperature were used to explore relationships.<br><br>Temperature – in particular the freezing point – was associated with caribou movement. The majority of northward caribou movement occurred between -2.4°C and 7.4°C. When the temperature rose above freezing early in the year, the caribou began their migration early and vice versa. The results suggest that continued warming in the Arctic would lead to earlier migrations of the Western Arctic Herd. Potential impacts on caribou and subsistence users merit further study of temperature and other variables.

INVERTBRATES OF WATER-FILLED BRACTS IN HELICONIA CARIBAEA FROM SABA, PART TWO
Courtney Megan Bass
Edmond Memorial High School, Edmond, OK

The aquatic invertebrates living in the liquid-filled bracts of Heliconia caribaea inflorescences were studied on Saba, a small island in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Samples were collected by covering each inflorescence with a zip lock bag and emptying the contents into the bag. The volume of water was measured and the organisms were returned to the laboratory for sorting, identification, and counting. All inflorescences that were sampled had invertebrates living in their bracts. These inflorescences contained an average of 294 invertebrates and 5.8 species. Immature dipterans and hydrachnids composed the most abundant groups found in the inflorescences. A Spearman rank order value indicated a correlation existed between the volume of liquid and the number of individuals in each inflorescence. Based on these samples, a confidence interval of 294 ± 149 individuals for each inflorescence was estimated. The Mann-Whitney statistic indicated there were no significant differences in numbers of individuals in collections made at higher elevations of Saba when compared to those from lower elevations of the island. The Mann-Whitney statistic also indicated there were no significant differences in numbers of individuals in collections made on the windward side of Saba when compared to those from the leeward side of the island. A total of 17 species were collected from the H. caribaea inflorescences, bringing the total number of invertebrates known from all aquatic habitats in Saba to 32 species.

THE EFFECTS OF REDUCED SALINITY ON BARNACLE SURVIVAL: IMPLICATIONS FOR LARGE-SCALE FRESHWATER DIVERSIONS
Christopher Ryan Peterson
Ocean Springs High School, Ocean Springs, MS

The effects of freshwater inflow on barnacles, sessile crustaceans that are common to the Gulf Coast, were studied in a controlled environment. It was hypothesized that barnacles with more exposure to freshwater would have higher mortality. The barnacles settled on 4 groups of 4 boards each for 6 weeks. The barnacles were then placed in tanks of 15 ppt seawater, and were fed brine shrimp twice a day. Once a week four weeks, the 8-hour (E group) and 24-hour (T group) groups were switched to freshwater (for 8 or 24 hours), while the control (C group) and Identification (I group) groups remained in saltwater. Each week and at the beginning, the C, E, and T groups were counted, and the largest 5 barnacles on each board were measured. Near the end of the experiment, the barnacles were identified as Balanus eburneus and B. improvisus. Because clam worms (Nereis succinea) were suspected to be eating the barnacles, the experiment was repeated, but the boards were cleaned before they entered the tanks. A split-plot ANOVA was run on the data, and showed that the control group had significantly higher survival than the two experimental groups, and all showed significant linear decreases in survivorship overtime. The hypothesis was supported. This suggests that freshwater inflow may have negative impacts on other sessile marine species.

THE ANTIOXIDANT EFFECTS OF GREEN TEA ON SELECTED ORGANISMS
Jack Andrew Kovaleski
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose was to determine the effectiveness of green tea on Daphnia. The hypothesis was if Daphnia was given green tea, then it would live longer and have higher rates of reaction. One green tea bag was put in boiling water for four minutes at concentrations of 1 bag/500 mL, 1 bag/1000 mL, and 1 bag/2000 mL. Five Daphnia/test were put in the cooled tea and tested for heart rate, eye twitches, somersaults, appendage movements, and eggs after 5 minutes, 24 hours, and 72 hours. When experimentation began, the Daphnia in both the 1 bag/500 mL and 1 bag/1000 mL did not survive longer than 24 hours while the Daphnia in the 2000 mL concentration survived at least 72 hours and were at threshold level of survival. Compared to control, results showed that heart rate increased significantly in the 24 hour (t=3.38>t0.01=3.355) and 5 minute (t=2.83>t0.05=2.306) test of the 1 bag/500 mL concentrations. In the 1 bag/2000 mL test, only the heart rate increase for the 5 minute test (t=2.88>t0.05=2.306) was significant. However, in the 72 hours of the 1 bag/2000 mL concentration test, the heart rate decreased 4.22%. Compared to control, eye twitches decreased significantly for the 1 bag/500 mL 24 hour (t=2.71>t0.05=2.306), 1 bag/1000 mL 5 minute (t=3.04>t0.05=2.306), and 1 bag/2000 mL 5 minute (t=2.32>t0.05=2.306) and 72 hour (t=3.87>t0.01=3.355) tests. However, although not statistically significant, in the 72 hours of the 1 bag/2000 mL test, eye twitches increased 32.5% and appendage movements increased 66.3%.

MORPHOLIGICAL CORRELATES OF COMMUNICATION SIGNALS IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH
Michael William Helbig
Christopher Columbus High School, Miami, FL

Weakly electric fish, indigenous to Africa and South America, emit weakly electric signals that they use for communication and electro-location. These signals, also known as electric organ discharges (EODs), vary in amplitude and frequency and are species-specific. The aim of this experiment was to examine the relationships between morhpological characteristics, weight and length, and the defining parameters, amplitude and frequency of the EOD in 6 species of weakly electric fish from South America. I measure weight, length, amplitude, frequency in 6 species (Gymnotus cylidricus, Gymnotus ucamara, Gymnotus carapo, Steatogenys elegans, Rhamphichthys marmoratus, Sternopygus macrurus) by individually placing them in a pre-acclimated tank, which matched the conductivity and temperature of their home tanks. The tank was equipped with recording electrodes which connected to an oscilloscope and voltmeter. According to the data I gathered during experimentation, weight and length are accurate determinants of amplitude. In contrast, weight and length were not accurate determinants of frequency except in Gymnotus ucamara, which has an inverse relation between body weight and frequency.

NEURONAL DISTRIBUTION OF UROCORTIN III IN THE FIRE-BELLIED TOAD, BOMBINA ORIENTALIS
Robin Nichol Barawid
Briarcrest Christian High School, Eads, TN

Urocortin III (Ucn-3) is a novel member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) gene family of neuropeptides and a primary agonist of the CRF2 receptor. As such, it is assumed to be actively involved in the modulation of behavioral responses to stress for the reestablishment of homeostasis; recent studies have shown that it activates such responses as vasodilation, suppressed aggression, and inhibited locomotion. Because Ucn-3 was only discovered in 2001, very little is known about it, and what has been studied primarily discusses its function in mammals. Therefore, the present study intended to generate the first map of the comprehensive neuronal distribution of Ucn-3-ir perikarya and fibers in a nonmammalian vertebrate, with B. orientalis as the representative species for anurans. Intensely stained Ucn-3-ir perikarya were found in the infundibular hypothalamus and ventral linings of the central ventricle, while fibers were found in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, and ubiquitously throughout the hypothalamus. Interestingly, many Ucn-3-ir fibers (probably dendrites) penetrated the ependyma to contact the ventricles, suggesting that the cells were secreting the neuropeptide into the cerebrospinal fluid for transport to other parts of the brain. A model for the manufacture and transport of Ucn-3 and a model for the neuroendocrine response to stress were proposed based on the reported distribution of the peptide and its consistency with the known localization of CRF2.

RESILIENCE/SURVIVORSHIP OF A RED SEA FRINGING CORAL REEF UNDER EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS: A FOUR-YEAR STUDY
Zaki Daniel Moustafa
A.W. Dreyfoos High School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, FL

A four-year study, which began in the summer of 2004, collected the first comprehensive time-series from a 0.8 km x 0.2 km fringing reef located in Gulf of Suez (29 32' N and 32 24' E), Red Sea at the extreme northernmost latitude for tropical coral reefs. Corals here are exposed to 2-6 C daily water temperature differences and seasonal variations that exceed 14-16 C. Salinities are extreme, ranging between 44 and 45 psu. Annual reef surveys included random photo quadrats, fixed coral video transects, and a suite of accessory environmental measurements. In just four years, this pristine reef community was subjected to many new stresses including: shipping port construction, rapid coastal urbanization, a global bleaching event in 2005, and an oil spill.<br><br>Results indicate that of the approximately 40 known coral species robust enough to survive here, just six compose approximately 94% of this reef. Between 2004 and 2007, statistically significant decreases in reef health indicators were found, including: a 50% increase in dead coral, a 58% increase in sea urchins, and decreases in biodiversity, fish abundance, and water quality. Since 2004, incidences of coral diseased and fish bites have increased dramatically. Despite these indicators, the reef appears to be adapting to newly introduced stresses, which may increase long-term survivability, and suggests that reefs experiencing extreme conditions may be more resilient to natural and manmade stresses than more tropical reefs. This research establishes a reference point for comparison with similar reefs and key to future conservation and restoration efforts.

POPULATION APPRAISAL AND THE DEVISAL OF AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE BANANA BORER ON GUAM
Shruti Nagarajan
John F. Kennedy High School, Tamuning, Tamuning, GUAM

The Cosmopolites sordidus(Germar,1824) was accidentally introduced into Guam from Hawaii in 1991 and since then the invasive insect has sustained it’s population and has thrived on the abundance of ornamental palms on Guam. The insect’s larvae feed of the trunks of palms causing the trunks to become brittle, hollow, and susceptible to damage by cyclonic winds. The borer-infested trees literally snap during the typhoons that regularly strike Guam. The primary objectives of this project were to find an organic and inexpensive way to control the spread of the borer and to assess the population of the invasive insect on Guam.<br><br>The Capture-Recapture Technique was utilized in the census, through the setting up of pheromone and food-volatile baited traps in different locations across the island. <br><br> Concentrations (125g/liter, 250g/liter) of Achiote were used, on sugarcane stalks that were inoculated with weevil larvae. The stalks were opened and changed tri-weekly and measurements of the larvae/pupae we recorded.<br><br>I received considerably higher captures/recaptures in areas that were densely populated with ornamental palms. The capture-recapture formula provided a census of 11,469 borers.<br><br>Both concentrations average widths and weights were significantly greater than that of the control group and the mortality rate in the concentrations (125g/liter=60%, 250g/liter=80%) was significantly higher as opposed to the 0% mortality rate in the control.<br><br>The contributions of this project are two-fold. First, we now have an idea of the population of the borer on Guam. Secondly, this project also provides an organic and an inexpensive alternative for controlling the borer.

DETERMINING PLOIDY IN DIADEGMA INSULARE MALES USING MORPHOMETRICS
Emily Victoria Schock, Megana Sankaran, 
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Diadegma insulare is a small wasp species that is used as a biological pest control for diamondback moths, the larva of which damages cole crops. Diadegma insulare use Complementary Sex Determination (CSD) to establish the sex of each wasp. Populations of Diadegma insulare are unable to be sustained in the laboratory due to a male bias in the sex ratio. The purpose of this project is to determine the cause of this phenomenon. It is hypothesized that a depleted number of sex determination alleles could be the cause of the abnormal sex ratio. This can be indicated by an unusual presence of diploid males, which are often larger than haploid males. <br><br> Measurements of the wasp body, abdomen and wing as well as the amount of setae along the designated diagonal and edge of the wing were taken to prove the existence of two types of Diadegma insulare males. Female measurements were taken as the control. The first trial used two hundred wasps, while the second used four hundred. Bimodality was found in both the male body length and setae along the diagonal in both trials, representing two types of males. Graphs of female body length and setae along the diagonal displayed one maximum peak, representing one type of female. The presence of haploid and diploid males is further indicated by the range in the data, showing a larger variation in the male population than the female population. These results support the hypothesis that a depleted number of sex determination alleles in the population is causing a male-biased sex ratio.

IMPACT OF DIETARY RESTRICTION ON FECUNDITY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Cole Taylor, Micha'le Simmons, 
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the impact of dietary restriction on fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster. It was hypothesized that if a population of Drosophila was exposed to a diet-restricted (DR) media, then it would experience increased and optimal fecundity in opposition to a control population. Wild-Type male and virgin female Drosophila were separated, by gender, into vials of control (C) media and 50% DR media. 30 Drosophila were contained in each vial, and allowed to feed for 2 weeks prior to initial mating. Four mating groups were established: CM + CF, CM + DRF, DRM + DRF, and DRM + CF. Pairs of Drosophila in any given category were placed in either C media or DR media, and given two weeks to produce an F1 generation which was fully exposed to the specified media. Using Drosophila from this generation, Level I of experimentation was established, in which 48 vials were organized; flies were contained in either C media or 50% DR media. At Day 4, fecundity was quantified by counting the amount of larvae or pupae present in the first litter. Level II of experimentation was conducted using the F2 generation produced by Level I Drosophila; 72 vials were organized, containing only the CM + CF and DRM + DRF mating groups. Drosophila were placed in C media, 25% DR media, 50% DR media, and 75% DR media. Fecundity was quantified in the same manner. Level III experimentation was planned to include quantifications of longevity and mortality, in addition to further explorations of dietary restriction in varied macromolecular groups. <br><br>Initial statistical analysis using 2-sample T-tests revealed highly significant figures in support of the hypothesis. Of Level I experimentation, the DRM + DRF group was the most significant against the control [p=.00007]; the 75% DR group of Level II experimentation was the most significant in opposition to the control group [p=.0000112]. Appicability of this investigation is widespread throughout healthcare and agriculture, whereas future research opportunities are similarly numerous.

ANTHROPOGENIC INFLUENCES ON THE CALIFORNIA SEA OTTER (ENHYDRA LUTRIS NEREIS) POPULATION IN MOSS LANDING HARBOR
Emily Louise Dolson, Sanaya Forbes, 
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA

The California sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) has been highly endangered since being nearly hunted to extinction one hundred years ago by fur traders. The population is taking far longer to recover than predicted. As the sea otter is a keystone species in the kelp forest ecosystem, it is crucial to understand what factors are inhibiting its growth. Human impacts, though widely suspected, have not been closely examined. The purpose of this project was to determine what effects, if any, humans have on sea otter well-being. What behavioral changes occur in sea otters when humans approach them? The hypothesis was that, if approached, otters would dive and swim away, thus inhibiting the thermoregulative abilities which are essential for survival. An important corollary hypothesis was that humans would approach sea otters, even though it is illegal under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. A raft of sea otters floating in Moss Landing Harbor was observed over six months, using a time-budget methodology to insure that results were statistically comparable. Every ten minutes, the location and activity levels of all otters were recorded, along with a variety of other factors that could affect sea otter behavior. Human interactions were noted as new entries, allowing comparison of alterations in group dynamics. Through a comparison of differences in behaviors between these data points, it was determined that human approach changes otter behavior in a statistically significant manner. Our results suggest that a reexamination of current laws may be in order to more effectively protect otters.

A BUG'S (PRIVATE) LIFE: THE EGG-LAYING PREFERENCES OF LYGUS LINEOLARIS
Michelle Elise Johnson, Lyndsey Tindall, 
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

Lygus lineolaris, or the tarnished plant bug, is a significant threat to a wide range of crops. Its feeding habits cause damage to developing fruit, which is harmful to crop yields. This experiment seeks to study oviposition preferences of the tarnished plant bug, in order to improve plant bug-rearing techniques. This will enable more research to be performed and help to remove plant bugs as a threat to crops.<br><br>Experiments were conducted to determine which color of egg-pack was most preferred for oviposition, whether plant bugs oviposited in any color of egg-pack if not given a choice, whether the color of the egg-pack affected oviposition rate, whether plant bugs based their choice of egg-pack on color or on a chemical in the food dye, and whether plant bugs preferred to oviposit with or without light. Egg-packs were placed on boxes full of plant bugs so the insects could oviposit in the packs. For the choice-test, four differently-colored egg-packs were used, and for the no-choice test only one color of egg-pack was used. After three hours, the egg-packs were removed and replaced with fresh egg-packs. Both tests were repeated without light. After the experiments were completed, the number of eggs oviposited in each experiment was analyzed.<br><br>It was found that the plant bugs preferred the neutral-colored egg-pack in the light and the green egg-pack in the dark. This suggests that a chemical in the food dye was the factor in egg-pack preference, because in the light-test the green egg-pack was favored only slightly less than the neutral egg-pack. In the no-choice no-light test, green egg-packs were preferred over neutral egg-packs. In both of the no-choice tests, plant bugs oviposited less when given an egg-pack whose color they disliked. In the light-dark tests, the plant bugs oviposited more in the dark.

CONSUMPTION OF FOOD ELABORATED ON THE BASIS OF CRICKETS (ACHETA DOMESTICUS), AS A COMPLEMENT RICH IN PROTEINS
Camila Silvina Correa, Marcela Guerra, 
Liceo NO 5, Tacuarembo, URUGUAY

The purpose of this project is to search for a source of proteins which is<br><br>abundant and not expensive since it has been detected that most children are<br><br>quite short due to the fact that they do not consume enough proteins. The<br><br>crickets (Acheta domesticus) can be considered as an alternative source owing<br><br>to their abundance and the fact of containing proteins as any other insect. On<br><br>the basis of the points mentioned above, the aim of this project is to investigate the nutritive value of these insects and the possibility of including them in our daily diet. To achieve our aims some professionals were interviewed: a paediatrician, a chemist and a nutritionist. The survey indicates that proteins are essential in the psycho-physical development of children and that not all the proteins have the same nutritive value. A breeding place was built in order to obtain some specimens. An analysis of the recognition of proteins with nitric acid within the crickets is done. Apart from this, flour was elaborated, which was used to prepare biscuits. The result of the analysis made to the crickets was positive concerning proteins. On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that the cricket are an alternative source of proteins consumption. Furthermore, the cultural barriers are an important obstacle for the consumption of these insects. We hope this project may contribute to solve a problem that concerns everyone throughout the world and raise awareness about the vital importance of proteins<br><br>consumption.

POLLUTION IS A MAJOR FACTOR INFLUENCING POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE OF WILD GOLDFISH IN LAKE DIANCHI, CHINA
Zijie Zhang, Shiying Li, Yuqiuxiao Wu
Middle School Attached to Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, CHINA

Lake Dianchi ranks as one of the three most polluted lakes in China. It contains variable levels of pollution, depending on the proximity to the city of Kunming. The lake serves as a source of fish for human consumption, including wild goldfish (Carassius auratus). These common fish have two chromosomal forms: diploids and triploids. The effect of lake pollution on the genetic structure of goldfish was assessed by evaluating the relative proportions of ploidy levels, using flow cytometry, and haplotype diversity (Hd), involving sequencing mtDNA D-loop. Pearson correlation was used to statistically investigate the association between the two measures of genetic diversity and five independent measures of water pollution. <br><br><br> Water pollution decreased from north to south in Lake Dianchi. In parallel, the relative proportion of triploids to diploids dramatically decreased, while the haplotype diversity gradually increased. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the frequency of diploid fishes was significantly correlated with Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) (P=0.002), biological oxygen demand (BOD) (P=0.045) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) (P=0.029). The frequency of diploids was not significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). In comparison, Hd was significantly correlated with TP and TN (P=0.001), but not significantly correlated with CODMn and Chl-a. Although strong directional selection was indicated for both genetic measures, they appeared to be selected independently. Our finding indicated that water pollution and eutrophication might have led to the dramatic historical changes in the wild goldfish’s genetic structure.

AUTOTOMY AS A MEANS OF SURVIVAL IN THE SEA CUCUMBER, HOLOTHURIA GLABERRIMA
Eric Rafael Rodriguez-Reyes, Luis A. Rodriguez Reyes, 
University Gardens Special High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

There is a wide variety of Echinoderms in the ocean. This is a phylum of 6000 species, and one of its groups has a high regeneration capability, specifically those of the Holothuria class. The “Holothuria glaberrima” sea cucumber, has the capability to regenerate its digestive system through the process of autotomy or evisceration by which it expels some of its organs. The problem for this investigation was: How is the oxygen intake of the sea cucumber: “Holothuria glaberrima” related to its evisceration process? The hypothesis under study was that there is a relationship between the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the process of evisceration of the sea cucumber “H. glaberrima” as a means of survival, since the oxygen intake of the animal decreases after evisceration. The experiment was divided into two phases. In the first phase the oxygen intake of one sea cucumber was measured and then the oxygen of another sea cucumber was measured before, during and after evisceration. In the second phase of the experiment the oxygen intake of three other sea cucumbers was measured before, during and after evisceration. This was measured using a device called dissolved oxygen probe which measures the DO in mg/L, for a period of 60 minutes. According to the experimental data, the sea cucumber “H. glaberrima” uses more DO during and after evisceration. The results contradicted the hypothesis. The reason for this phenomenon is that the sea cucumber uses a high amount of energy during the evisceration process.

A GIS ANALYSIS OF LAND USE IN COMPARISON TO THE QUANTITY OF BALING TWINE IN OSPREY NESTS
Matt Charles Parker, Max Egenhoff, 
Hellgate High School, Missoula, MT

Ospreys collect baling twine and use it to line and pad their nests. When Osprey chicks explore the nest, they can easily entangle themselves in the baling twine and suffer serious injury and even death due to starvation. Adult birds can become seriously entangled and die as well. We hypothesized that there is a direct correlation between the percentage of agricultural or pasture land use in the area surrounding a nest and the amount of baling twine inside the nest. <br><br>For our current and ongoing analysis we have visited many nests, collected the coordinates and ranked the nests using a categorical index with scores from zero to four to judge the amount of visible baling twine and create semi quantified data to work with. We then inserted the coordinates onto the GIS program Arc Map, from this we were able to quantify the surrounding land use in the form of a percentage of agricultural or land with pastures. We have collected data on most of the nests in the Missoula valley, and have found that there is a strong correlation between the percentages of agricultural or pasture land use and the amount of baling twine in the nest.

THE GENETIC VARIATION WITHIN THE FAMILY OF LITTORINA SAXATILIS
Johan Ingemar Boström, Tobias Hofving, 
Donnergymnasiet Gothenburg, Göteborg, SWEDEN

We studied the genetic variation within a family of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis. This was done by genetically determining the level of polyandry, multiple paternities, in one family of the species. L. saxatilis is a small, hard, intertidal snail known as the common periwinkle, indigenous throughout the North Atlantic. They can store sperm for up to a year and one family can thus have multiple fathers. The species is at large risk for incest because of the lack of a larval stage, limited dispersal skills, and closely confined small populations. We used microsatellite-DNA for our study and results showed that polyandry in the species is much larger than what was previously estimated. Our female had a minimum of 22 partners for the observed litter. This is the second highest documented level of polyandry in the world. We also proved that the species lacks a biological defense mechanism against incest. We used our results to draw conclusions about the population structures, migration capacity and incest-defense in the species. Our conclusions were built on previous theories on polyandry as well as other factors. We showed that the high level of polyandry could be used to efficiently reduce the disadvantages of inbreeding by creating a high genetic variation within the family. This also leads to a strong migration capacity because a single female could carry enough genetic data at one time to counteract the founder-effect. It also leads to a strong defense against fluctuating environmental conditions.

TO WHAT DEGREE DOES ANNULI COUNT REFLECT AGE IN MANOURIA EMYS? AN ANALYSIS OF METHODOLOGY, YEAR FIVE OF THE MANOURIA EMYS INVESTIGATIONS
Richard Schinco Schaffer
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, FL

Manouria emys is a critically endangered species Southeast Asian tortoise. Assurance colonies are needed in which animals bred in captivity, later are repatriated if conditions improve. During this process, more knowledge of their growth is necessary.<br><br> Fifty Manouria emys were studied. Tortoise’s shells were cleaned to optimize accuracy. Annuli were counted manually and with digital photography for the second through fourth vertebral scutes. Selected tortoises had scutes casted. Data from observations were then analyzed, graphed, and correlation calculated. <br><br>The correlation between age and fourth vertebral scute was stronger (R2 = 0.8852 for physical examination (PE) and 0.9652 for photographic analysis (P)) over the second (R2=0.883 PE and 0.9642 P) or the third (R2 =0.8801 PE and 0.9576 P). The value for the average of the three scutes was strongest (R2 = 0.8943 PE and 0.9676 P).<br><br>A good correlation existed between age and annuli count, strongest in the middle age cohorts (3 to 5 years) because the annuli are well defined yet not obscured by wear. Fourth vertebrals had slightly better correlation over the second and third. The average of the three scutes yielded the most accurate because it diminished individual scute differences. Digital photography was the most accurate to determine age because of the ability to zoom and carefully evaluate the scutes. The casting was the least effective due to the difficulty to perform and read the casts, especially for the oldest and youngest tortoises.

NAVIGATION IN THE ODOROUS HOUSE ANT, TAPINOMA SESSILE
Sebastian Luke Scofield
Home school, Hillsboro, OR

The purpose of this project was to discover whether odorous house ants, Tapinoma sessile, are able to orient through visual cues alone when pheromone trails are removed. The experiments involved baiting foraging workers to a food source, and then removing the recruitment trails with rubbing alcohol. The paths the ants took were then recorded and compared to the original route taken to the food source. In addition, the time the routes took was recorded. Odorous house ants were found to be capable of orienting on visual cues alone when odor trails are absent, but this orientation is much slower and more inefficient, showing that odor trails are the primary orientation cue to foraging workers.

COPEPODS AND CHOLERA: AN ASSESSMENT OF FRESHWATER COPEPODS USED FOR BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL AS A RESERVOIR FOR THE CHOLERA CAUSING BACTERIUM VIBRIO CHOLERAE.
Madeleine Amanda Ball
Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Dallas, TX

Macrocyclops albidus, a freshwater copepod, is an effective ambush predator that shows promise as a biological control of container-breeding mosquito larvae. However, some brackish copepods have been implicated as a host and reservoir for the cholera-causing bacteria V. cholerae. This study assesses whether M. albidus is a reservoir for pathogenic strains of V. cholerae. Copepods were assayed in static microcosms of varying levels of salinity, pH and copepod density for 7 days and then tested for the presence of V. cholerae 01 and 0139 using direct fluorescent-monoclonal assays specific for the surface antigen of O139 lipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer membrane of V. cholerae O139, and colorimetric immunoassays with a reagent specific to the V. cholerae 01 antigen. Contrary to my hypothesis, coccoid “viable but not culturable” vibrio were detected in microcosms at all salinity and pH levels. Live copepods were not required for vibro survival in brackish water, but were required for survival in freshwater. Cannibalism by copepods was prevalent in trials with copepod density greater than 1copepod per/10ml of water thus preventing copepods from attaining requisite bacterium density needed for human contraction of cholera. Results demonstrate that M. albidus is a freshwater host and reservoir for V. cholera but not a primary cholera vector. Identifying non-traditional vibrio hosts will aid in the prevention and early detection of cholera. This study suggests that utilization of copepods for mosquito control is inappropriate in regions where human consumption of unsanitized water cannot be prevented.

REGENERATION OF BROWN PLANARIA FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO THE DRUG COLCHICINE - A 2-YEAR STUDY
Celena Louise Letcher
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, FL

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if DNA alteration due to exposure to the drug Colchicine affects the regenerative and reproductive rates of Dugesia tigrina (Brown Planaria). I hypothesized that the regenerative and reproductive rates would be inhibited. Three groups of 80 planaria each received the drug Colchicine, in concentrations of .0001% (A), .001% (B), and .01% (C) per liter of spring water. Group D only received spring water. Half of the planaria in each group were laterally cut, and daily observations were made for 12 days to determine regenerative and reproductive rates. <br><br>The average number of days for anterior Groups A through D to regenerate tails was 4.43, 6.83, 0, and 4.15, respectively. The overall average was 3.85, with a standard deviation of 3.06. The average number of days for posterior Groups to regenerate heads was 5.18, 5.95, 0, and 5.78. The overall average was 4.04, with a standard deviation of 2.69. The number of offspring produced from Whole Groups was 15, 10, 0, and 23, respectively, with an overall average of 12, and a standard deviation of 9.63. No offspring were produced from any of the anterior groups. The number of offspring produced from posterior Groups was 17, 6, 0, and 14, respectively, with an overall average of 9.25, and a standard deviation of 7.72. Following data analysis, I concluded that my hypothesis was correct: exposure to Colchicine affected the regenerative and reproductive rates of Dugesia tigrina. Further investigations may determine implications in the research of genetic variation in stem cell reproduction.

CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIATION FACTORS CONTROLLING BINUCLEATE CELL DEVELOPMENT IN BOVINE PLACENTA
Joy Lynn Burnham
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, FL

Placentation in bovines is a complicated process about which little is known. Binucleate cells form along with the placenta, but how they form, and what triggers them to form, is unknown. The purpose of this experiment is to determine what placental differentiation factors are present in bovines and which factors localize binucleate cell differentiation. The hypothesis is that the differentiation factor HAND-1 will be found in placental tissues. PCR was used to locate HAND-1 in these tissues. In conclusion, the gene HAND-1 was found in both tissue types. More research is needed to determine the presence of other genes, and to find the localization sites of genes.

EGG SHELL QUALITY AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY -YEAR 2- DOES THE AGE OF A QUAIL HEN EFFECT EGG SHELL THICKNESS?
Hannah Camille Roberts
Sumrall High School, Sumrall, MS

The purpose of this project was to determine if the age of a quail hen effects the specific gravity of the eggshell. The procedure was initialized from April 2008 to July 2008. Twenty eggs from one group of quail hens that were seven to ten months of age were used. These eggs were separated into five groups of four eggs. The grouping was based on the eggs' overall weight and air cell size. The dry weight was then obtained by measuring the four eggs' weight on a scale in grams. The wet weight was measured by submerging the eggs into water at room temperature. Specific gravity was then calculated by using the specific gravity formula. The results were analyzed and as the project continued the eggs' size increased, but the eggshells' quality decreased. The hypothesis was supported because the eggshell thickness declined as the quail hens' age increased.

ISOLATION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS HYICUS AND STREPTOCOCCUS EQUISIMILIS AND USE OF ISOLATE TO DEVELOP AVIAN ANTIBODIES TO BE USED IN THE PREVENTION OF PORCINE MASTITIS, PART 2
Samantha Kay Welu
Marshall High School, Marshall, MN

The purpose of my project is to prevent the mastitis on our hog farm, which we have been battling for many years. Last year, I proved that the bacteria that was causing the mastitis which was Staphylococcus aureus, would bind to avian antibodies (IgY) in an ELISA test. As a continuation this year, I made a product to deliver to the sows.<br><br> First, I collected milk and uterine samples, and sent them to a state university lab. The bacteria came back as Staphylococcus hyicus and Streptococcus equisimilis. I reconfirmed the bacteria by streaking it out onto blood agar plates, grew it, gram-stained it, and identified it as Staphylococcus hyicus and Streptococcus equisimilis under the microscope. I created an immunogen with the bacteria, and injected it into chickens. In two weeks, I collected the eggs and did an ELISA test on them. The antibodies binded, therefore, I used the eggs to create a product. My two delivery methods were: an udder spray, a feed additive. I also had a control group. Five bred sows were used per group. I took birth and weaning weights on the piglets. I took the results and calculated the total average weight gain per piglet. The udder spray group gained the most weight. Then, I calculated the total profit per piglet, per group. The udder spray had the most profit per piglet, which was $1.76. <br><br> In conclusion, the udder spray worked best, and I was able to find a product delivery method that worked.

STUDY ON THE FUNCTION OF STABILIMENTUM AND SILK IN THE EGG SAC OF ARGIOPE BRUENNICHI
Hange Li
Beijing No.2 Middle School, Beijing, CHINA

The author found two special behaviors of the Argiope bruennichi by accident, thus initiated this project. The two special behaviors were: firstly, the Argiope bruennichi wrapped up the quarry with its retinaculum for predation; secondly, the Argiope bruennichi had a kind of flocculent gossamer in its egg capsule, which had not been found in any reference. The research included extensive and multi-angle observations and place tests. It was discovered after series of field study, paired observations on sample plots that, firstly, the retinaculum of cobweb could assist spiderlings on predation; secondly, the flocculent gossamer in the egg capsule was the food for spiderlings. <br><br> The observation also told us that the Argiope bruennichi in Beijing reproduced every year, being spread widely but in a small amount. Reasons could be their short growing-up period, spiderling’s incapability of over-wintering and low hatchability of the egg capsules produced in late September.

AN ANALYSIS OF CRUDE PROTEIN ON THE GROWTH RATE AND CARCASS WEIGHT OF GALLUS DOMESTICUS
Abigail Jane Styron
Hilltop High School, West Unity, OH

The purpose of this project was to determine if a certain level of crude protein would affect a chicken’s growth rate and final carcass waste. It was hypothesized that chickens receiving a 24% crude protein diet would have a higher average growth rate gain, and have a lower percentage of final carcass waste than those with a 16% or 20% protein diet. <br><br>Twenty-six chickens were divided into three different groups at twenty days of age. For 31 days, they were fed commercial poultry feed containing either 16%, 20%, or 24% crude protein. Daily rate of gain and carcass weight data were statistically analyzed using T-tests. <br><br>The group that received the 24% crude protein had an average 73 grams daily gain compared to the 20% crude protein, which gained an average of 77 grams per day. The 16% crude protein percentage gained an average of 53 grams per day. The 16% group had the highest average carcass waste of 39%. The 24% group with an average of 37% carcass waste and the 20% group with a carcass waste of 32% had significantly less waste than the 16% group (p<=.04). <br><br>Overall the 20% crude protein group had the lowest carcass waste, and it had a higher average grams gained per day. The results of this research suggest that a 20% crude protein feed is the most efficient and profitable marketing strategy for the poultry industry.

CREATING RNAI ANTHELMINTICS
Elizabeth Lo-Ra Dick
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

Anthelmintic resistance in Haemonchus contortus threatens U.S. ranchers. Resistance to all anthelmintics exists within the nematode’s population. Current anthelmintics shut down parasites metabolism or prohibit muscular contractions. The question of this study was, “Can individual genes in H. contortus be targeted and blocked using RNAi (RNA interference) based anthelmintics?”<br><br>Last year’s experiment tested the viability of RNAi containing plasmids shipped between 0O C and 40O C using Ceanorhabditis elegans as a model for H. contortus. C. elegans has one of the most highly studied genomes and the most complete organism database for gene and protein function; many anthelmintics are tested using a C. elegans model. The purpose of this year’s experiment was to research C. elegans genes that regulate drug resistance, compare conserved genes between C. elegans and H. contortus, and to isolate H. contortus matches for use in RNAi drenches. <br><br>The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to compare seven H. contortus and C. elegans proteins and genes and to analyze probable matches. Three proteins associated with ivermectin resistance were well conserved between C. elegans and H. contortus. For all seven C. elegans proteins, the complementary H. contortus protein with the lowest E value was blasted against the incompletely published H. contortus base pair sequence. Primers were created for two of the resulting H. contortus sequences and PCR was performed; no product was identified. <br><br>In conclusion, three genes (AVR-14, AVR-15, and glc-1) associated with ivermectin resistance appear to be the best candidates for creating an RNAi drench.

THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICALS PYRETHRIN AND CARBARYL ON CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS CLARKII
Shuang Xu
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Crayfish are keystone species. Thus, aquatic pollution not only harms the crayfish themselves, but also their predators through biomagnifications and producers through ecological imbalance. This project implements Procambarus clarkii, a common crayfish species, to determine the distinct physiological and behavioral effects of the chemical pollutants pyrethrin and carbaryl. The physiological effects are measured via heart rate (HR) and ventilatory rate (VR). The behavioral effects include the observable crayfish state, and crayfish responses to sensory stimuli (ie. a bead drop in their holding tank and a direct tail touch), which simulate natural stimuli.<br><br> <br><br>At the same concentration 25.5µMol, pyrethrin has a more potent and immediate effect on crayfish. Physiologically, over 3 days, there is a uniform decrease in HR in crayfish under both chemicals, displaying a sickness. Pyrethrin contributes to a VR decrease; carbaryl contributes to an acute VR increase. Behaviorally, with pyrethrin application, there are relatively lower and shorter durations of HR/VR changes with a stimulus, displaying the crayfish’s insensitivity. After carbaryl introduction, there is little HR change but an increase in VR after the stimuli. Under the toxic environments, the crayfish may fail to perform tail flips or form aggressive posture. Tail flip and aggressive posture are classical responses, and the failures to perform the acts portray behavioral decline. By the end of the experiment, the crayfish may lay on their backs with only the swimmerets in erratic motion, signaling physical deterioration. This suggests that both pyrethrin and carbaryl should be avoided if not eliminated from implementation.

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MAMMALIAN ENAMEL STRUCTURES, ENAMEL MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND FEEDING HABITS
Jiankui Zhao
Jilin Provincial Experimental School, Changchun, JiLin, CHINA

While many studies on human teeth have been carried out, the studies on other mammalian teeth are limited. The purpose of this project is to explore the relationships among enamel structures, enamel mechanical properties, and feeding habits of mammals. A total of 581 mammalian teeth of nine species from four regions of China were collected. With the help of a CCD installed to a stereoscopic microscope, I recorded the videos of the whole surfaces of sliced teeth and an ocular micrometer by computer. Then, the real value of enamel prism lengths, enamel prism angles relative to enamel-dental junction (EDJ), and Hunter-Schreger band widths were able to be measured easily and repeatedly from the video screenshots by Photoshop. Furthermore, enamel microstructure and morphology were studied by scanning electron microscope. Result comparisons showed that enamel structures are closely related to mammalian feeding habits and environment. For example, the different ranges of enamel prism distribution angle relative to EDJ were discovered. To explore the correlations between structure and function, enamel Vickers hardness tests and the stress analyses in finite element models, which were designed based on the measurement results, were carried out. Result statistical analyses not only show how enamel structures are closely related to mammalian feeding habits, but also confirm my previous hypothesis that enamel should have optimized structure, which significantly regulates its stress distributions to better match mammalian mastication manner. These results will contribute to the research of bionic materials, mammalian taxonomy as well as the behavioral ecology of mammals.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF STORED-PRODUCT PEST MITES: A STUDY ON THE APPLICATION OF CHEYLETUS MALACCENSIS TO THE SUPPRESSION OF TYROPHAGUS PUTRESCENTIAE
Yuting Lin
Fuzhou No.1 Middle School, Fuzhou, Fujian, CHINA

This project explored the possibility for biologically controlling Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank), a stored-product pest mite that causes serious damage to grains. By using innovative methods such as functional response analysis, a predator mite named Cheyletus malaccensis was identified as an effective means for suppressing Tyrophagus putrescentiae. In the process of research, difference significance analysis and mathematical modeling were employed for data analysis, and chisquare test was carried out to verify the difference between the estimated and the measured values.<br><br> Among its major findings are (1) at 25 degree Celsius, an adult Cheyletus malaccensis feeds on 13-15 Tyrophagus putrescentiae per day and on more than 100 during lifetime; (2) the functional response of different stages of Cheyletus malaccensis to Tyrophagus putrescentiae matches Holling II’s disc equation; (3) Cheyletus malaccensis prefers the larva and nymph to the adult of Tyrophagus putrescentiae, its selection coefficient of the larva and nymph (1.47) is higher than that of the adult (1.04) ; (4) female adult Cheyletus malaccensis could have the highest predatory efficiency and handle the largest amount of prey in the shortest time, and (5) with an inter-disturbance constant of 0.5970, excessive population density of Cheyletus malaccensis would diminish its predatory efficiency.<br><br>Follow-up experiments showed that a pest mortality rate of 86.17% could be achieved 30 days after releasing Cheyletus malaccensis on Tyrophagus putrescentiae at the ratio of 1:10-15 in infested storehouses. These findings have resulted in a significantly more effective and more environment-friendly way for preventing pest mites in stored grains.

LYSINE AND METHIONINE SUPPLEMENTED LOW-PROTEIN CHICK DIETS: EFFECT ON GROWTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE
Rosemary Frances Chapple
Waterloo High School, Waterloo, IL

In recent years the cost of soybean meal and other commodities typically used in commercial broiler diets has escalated. Conversely, synthetic amino acid prices have been relatively stable. The purpose of this experiment was to determine how much soybean meal in chick diets can be replaced with only methionine, lysine and corn without sacrificing chick growth or feed efficiency. Thirteen diets were each fed to three pens of three chicks from day 5 to 19 post-hatch. Corn, soybean-meal diets formulated to three dietary protein levels (23, 20 and 17%) were compared to a positive control diet containing 30% protein. Dietary protein content was achieved by substituting corn for soybean meal. At each reduced protein level, methionine and/or lysine were factorially supplemented to determine which amino acid was first limiting and evaluate growth response to dietary amino acid concentration. Chick growth and feed utilization was maximized with methionine addition to the 23% protein diet indicating that methionine was indeed first limiting. Both methionine and lysine were required to optimize growth when fed 20% protein diets. No level of lysine and/or methionine fortification allowed chicks to grow maximally when fed 17% protein diets. Under current price conditions, the addition of synthetic methionine and lysine to 20% protein diets would save approximately $30 per thousand birds fed compared to feeding only intact protein sources. Further savings may be possible using 17% protein diets, but these diets would require fortification with other amino acids in addition to methionine and lysine.

CATTLE GRAZING EFFECTS ON TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDERS
Nathaniel Wade Hubbs
Camden Central High School, Camden, TN

Cattle grazing results in significant impacts to ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cattle grazing would have adverse impacts on salamander populations. Impacts from cattle grazing were studied by monitoring salamanders in grazed and ungrazed areas. Artificial cover boards were used for population monitoring and were placed along transects in each study area. After nine months, salamander counts were statistically analyzed. The mean monthly salamander count was similar between the two study areas. A comparison of the monthly counts showed no significant difference between the study areas (P < 0.05). However, the distribution of salamanders showed they were more evenly distributed in the No Cattle Study Area. Salamanders were not observed at the middle stations where cattle were most prevalent. The No Cattle Study Area had approximately 37% more salamander observations than the Cattle Study Area. The length frequency distribution showed the No Cattle Area had both juvenile and adult salamanders while the Cattle Area had only adult salamanders. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was supported and that cattle did have an adverse impact on the salamander population where cattle grazed.

EFFICACY OF PHYTOCHEMICALS AS GROWTH REGULATORS IN AEDES POLYNESIENSIS LARVAE (PHASE I)
Samuel Ioka Meleisea
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

The aim of this project was to study the efficacy of phytochemicals as growth regulators in Aedes polynesiensis larvae against three plants: neem (Azadirachta indica), sugar apple (Annona squamosa), and ilangilang (Cananga odorata). Collection of larvae was carried out by placing buckets filled with tap water in locations suitable for Aedes polynesiensis breeding around the Meleisea residence in Tafuna, American Samoa. Extracts were made by using a modified traditional method. Fresh neem, sugar apple, and ilangilang leaves were blended separately in tap water using a blender and then filtered through a fine cloth. Leaf extracts were tested in different dilutions against second instar larvae of Aedes polynesiensis. Growth and mortality data were collected every 24 hours and analyzed. Results show neem with high toxicity along with sugar apple. Ilangilang has minimum effect in inhibiting mosquito larvae. All three plant extracts successfully retarded the normal growth patterns of Aedes polynesiensis larvae.

Over the past ten years, Hygrophila pogonocalyx, a rare plant species with an original narrow distribution in wetlands along the west coast of central Taiwan, has been purposely cultivated cross Taiwan for off-site restoration. However, extensive anthropogenic planting of certain plant species may cause sympatric divergence of herbivore insects. Here, I show that a nymphalid butterfly Junonia iphita iphita, which originally relied mainly on the hostplant Strobilanthes formosanus, can now recognize H. pogonocalyx as a new hostplant. The potential effects of H. pogonocalyx restoration on J. i. iphita are analyzed and discussed.<br><br>J. i. iphita collected from a site with both S. formosanus and H. pogonocalyx showed distinct female oviposition preference for one or the other species, a preference that was heritable for three generations tested. Their respective preference for S. formosanus or H. pogonocalyx was also revealed in male territoriality. The male territorial behavior together with female egg-laying preference could increase the opportunity for assortative mating, which reduces the gene flow between individuals with different preference. Offspring also had better growth performance on the hostplant which their parents preferred. Moreover, the survival rate of hybrid offspring was decreased, reducing the fitness of hybrid individuals. Genetic differences among these populations were compared by analyzing microsatellite and RAPD markers. Taken together, the behavioral and physiological differences suggest that divergence has occurred between these populations. The choice in host plant usage of J. i. iphita may represent an early stage of sympatric speciation via host shifting.

THE EFFECT OF THE ADIPOSE60 MUTATION ON THE LOCOMOTION OF WILD TYPE AND VESTIGIAL WINGED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Alyssa Chelsea Ehrlich
South Side High School, Rockville Centre, NY

Obesity, a metabolic disorder characterized by the excess accumulation of body fat, has reached epidemic proportions. Genetics may be a contributing factor in the obesity epidemic. Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, is an ideal model for genetic studies as its genome is very similar to that of humans. A genetic mutation, adipose60, abbreviated adp60, was identified in a population of obese Drosophila in Kaduna, Nigeria. The adp60 allele of the adipose gene causes loss of adipose activity, which results in increased lipid content. Adp is an evolutionarily conserved gene that controls lipid storage; it is present in mice, fruit flies, C elegans worms, and humans. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if a gene that functioned to increase lipid storage would consequently reduce energy production. In this experiment, the walking speeds of adp60, vestigial winged (vg), vgadp60, and wild type fruit flies were compared. The time it took each fly to walk up a vial a distance of 8 cm was measured. Two trials for 25 flies in each group were recorded, for a total of 100 flies and 200 trials. Locomotor performance served as an indicator of lipid metabolic function. Average times in seconds for the groups are adp60 - 15.178, vgadp60 - 12.619, vg -4.304 and wild -7.507. The data reveals taht the presence of adp60 greatly increases the walking time while the presence of the vg mutation slightly decreases walking time. Adp60 appears to hinder the fat burning metabolism and consequently energy production.

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF VECTOR-BORNE PATHOGENS
Timothy Sterling Hurd
Sumner High School, Sumner, WA

Global climate change will have far reaching consequences, which may include changes in transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Anaplasma ovis is a tick-borne pathogen of sheep transmitted by Dermacentor andersoni. In this project I examined the correlation between A. ovis infection in flocks with the tick activity period, which is a product of the climate where the flocks are located.<br><br>The percent of sheep infected in each flock was determined using a commercially available cELISA on serum samples collected from each flock. To determine the tick activity period I used an analysis based on cumulative degree-days, with a lower temperature threshold of 5˚ C and an upper limit of 330 cumulative degree-days. I estimated the period of tick activity as the time between the average daily temperatures rising above the 5˚C cutoff and the accumulation of 330 degree-days. I then compared the period of tick activity for each flock against the percent of sheep that tested positive for A.ovis infection.<br><br>There was a strong linear relationship between tick activity period and infection (y = 1.06x – 17.2, y = % infection, x = activity period; r2 = 0.8487). Based on this analysis I accepted my hypothesis that the longer the period of tick activity the higher the percent infection of the flock. Using this equation I can predict the effect climate change may have on transmission of A. ovis; the percent of infection will increase approximately 1 percent for each day added to the tick activity period.

DIFFERENTIATION OF BOVINE ADIPOSE DERIVED ADULT STEM CELLS
Melissa Severn McDowell
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The current success rate for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is about 1-2% as a result of the inability of the donor cell to be properly reprogrammed. The objective was to ultimately develop a more efficient model for SCNT. This project characterized adult somatic stem cells from bovine adipose tissue for their ability to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Bovine adipose-tissue derived stem (ADAS) cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation with phosphate buffered saline. The treatment ADAS cells and the negative control bovine fetal derived skin fibroblasts were plated into T12.5 sized flasks. The cells were cultured for three weeks under the appropriate differentiation conditions, and the media was changed every 3-4 days. After three weeks, all cells were stained and observed for a qualitative result. ADAS cells stained positive for adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. The negative control fetal derived skin fibroblasts did not uptake the stain, indicating a lack of induced differentiation. These results suggest that bovine ADAS cells demonstrate the appropriate characteristics of being stem cells and may increase the success rate of SCNT when used as donor cells. In addition, these cells can be used for tissue regeneration without the risk of rejection and will also circumvent the controversies associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.

RESEARCH ON THE COCONUT RHINOCEROS BEETLE, ORYCTES RHINOCEROS
Natasha Leinaala Asopa'epa'e Fuiava
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

This experiment was to use two different methods of introducing the Oryctes virus to the rhinoceros beetle larvae in order to create the most significant way of controlling the beetle. The first trial held the contaminated larvae with the healthy larvae, serving as a straight introduction to the virus. The second trial extracted the virus into 5mL which was tested in four different solutions of purified water (12.5mL, 25mL, 50mL and 100mL) that was mixed with 50g of sterilized coconut husk. The control solution for the experiment was 50g of sterilized coconut husk deficient to either solutions. The reason this trial held different concentrations were to vary between the extractions of the virus.<br><br>Each trial was held with the duration of six days, in which I observed the adequacy of each method. It was hypothesized that the best method would be the first trial, because it served as a straight introduction to the Oryctes virus. Results showed that within trial one the larvae illustrated the mortality rate of thirty, forty-four and seventy-seven percents whereas trial two showed no mortality rate.

NATURAL MOSQUITO CONTROL, YEAR VII: FIELD EVALUATION OF BOTANICAL EXTRACT MEXICAN MARIGOLD, TAGETES MINUTA LUCIDA, AS A BARRIER SPRAY FOR MANAGING MOSQUITOES
Taylor Paige Wood
Sam Houston High School, Lake Charles, LA

Over one million people die every year from mosquito-borne diseases. While it is not possible to eliminate all mosquitoes, it is important to take measures to reduce the risk of people being bitten by infected mosquitoes to prevent transmission of these diseases. My research was to assess, under field conditions, the efficacy of plant extract from Mexican marigold, Tagetes minuta lucida, as a barrier spay against various mosquito species. <br><br> Treatment sprays were made from the plant leaves into 3.4% and 10.1% concentrations. Both concentrations and Riptide, a commercial insecticide used as a comparison, were tested with an outdoor automatically timed application misting system. Mosquito populations were measured at the treatment and control site with EVS traps. Two 15 day trials were conducted; three nights of pretreatment, seven nights spraying, followed by five nights post-treatment sampling. <br><br> The results of the tests conducted revealed that the Mexican marigold treatment sprays were effective in reducing adult mosquito populations. An analysis of variance and t-test showed that all three spraying treatments were significantly different. The population reductions due to the treatments were calculated by using Mulla’s formula. Riptide showed a 78% reduction of mosquitoes followed by Mexican marigold 10.1% concentration at 75%, and the 3.4% concentration at a 29% reduction. <br><br> The obvious benefits of these plant extracts would provide a natural alternative in controlling mosquitoes therefore protecting the public and the environment from chemical exposure. The significant impact could be worldwide because of existence and sustainability of these plants located in various countries where production could possibly be done simply and affordably.

IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING EVOLUTIONARY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SWEAT BEES AND NEMATODES
Tara Anjali Adiseshan
Ramana Academy, Charlottesville, VA

Sweat bees and commensal nematodes are involved in intimate ecological relationships, the evolutionary consequences of which are relatively unexplored. This study is original and attempts to classify the evolutionary relationships between sweat bees and nematodes through the examination and comparison of the phylogenetic trees of both organisms. Determining the evolutionary relationships between sweat bees and nematodes will not only provide a greater understanding of the interactions between these organisms, but will also provide insights into the evolutionary history of these two species.<br><br> It was hypothesized that sweat bees and nematodes have been undergoing cospeciation, which was based on the level of intimacy between host and symbiont. Congruent phylogenies can indicate that the common ancestor to the symbiont clade infected the common ancestor to the host clade. The gene cytochrome oxidase 1 was sequenced from multiple samples from six species of sweat bees that host nematodes. These sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which was then compared to an existing phylogenetic tree for nematodes. DNA sequences were edited with the program Sequencher, then aligned in the program MEGA. With this data, a phylogenetic tree was created using the MEGA phylogeny analysis tool. <br><br> The comparison of the phylogenetic trees showed clear evidence of co-cladogenesis, thus supporting the hypothesis. The relationship between bees and nematodes is therefore ancient, with speciation in a host bee resulting in speciation in the nematode.

THE EFFECT OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BACTERIA ON CULEX TARSALIS
Julia Teuila Laufiso
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

Mosquitoes are major carriers of pathogens that cause life threatening<br><br>illnesses to humans and other organisms. Millions die each year due to<br><br>mosquito transmitted Malaria alone, and thus steps must be taken to<br><br>accelerate mosquito abatement. Genetic engineering is one of the many<br><br>ways to stunt the mosquito population. This study focused specifically<br><br>on biological larvicide application. The purpose of the experiment was to test the effect of<br><br>genetically modified bacteria on mosquito growth and development. Data<br><br>was gathered in the Farmington Bay Area in Northern Utah. The biological<br><br>larvicide used was a new combination of VectoBac G and VectoLex CG. The<br><br>results of the new combination of biological larvicides from the initial<br><br>field data demonstrated long term results, effecting the mosquito’s<br><br>growth and development, as well as immediate results by rupturing the<br><br>mosquito’s gut. To investigate the concentration necessary to be<br><br>effective, an experiment was conducted in order to find the Lethal<br><br>Dosage (LD 90) or the least amount of larvicide with the highest rate of<br><br>larvae extermination using the biological larvicide VectoBac 12AS. The<br><br>larvae were exposed to dilutions of the VectoBac 12AS in concentrations<br><br>of 1.0ppm to 20.0 ppm. The data showed that ninety percent of the<br><br>population was killed with the dilution of 20.0 ppm. These results<br><br>verified that the VectoBac was effective in exterminating the larvae at<br><br>very low concentrations that are environmentally safe.Continuing to use gentetic engineering and testing biological larvcides for mosquito control is imperative and will save millions of lives.

THE EFFECT OF MALE SIZE ON CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY IN THE PARASITIC WASP ENCARSIA PERGANDIELLA
Mahwish Rani Khalid
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Cardinium is a symbiotic bacterium that causes cytoplasmic incompatibility in the parasitic wasp Encarsia pergandiella. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) results in no or few offspring produced when a Cardinium infected male is crossed with an uninfected female. Larger male wasp may house a higher density of Cardinium thus having a greater occurrence of CI. In this study the correlation between male size and cytoplasmic incompatibility was investigated. Male size was detemined by hind tibia length. Three treatments consisting of crosses of uninfected males with uninfected females, small-infected males with uninfected females and large infected males with uninfected female, were evaluated. Offspring from each treatment were counted to determine the occurrence of CI. It was expected that the larger males would have a greater degree of CI. The average number of offspring for the large males was 8.5, small males 7.5 and the control produced and average of 31.5 offspring.The results implied that there was no correlation between male size and the degree of CI.

FLIPPIN' CRAZY: THE EFFECTS OF INSULIN AND GLUCOSE ON THE ESCAPE REFLEX OF PALMERI LONGIMANUS
Bretton Roy Medlin
Grove High School, Grove, OK

Does insulin and glucose have an affect on the escape reflex of Palmeri longimanus? It is hypothesized that glucose and insulin will alter the escape reflex distance. It is further hypothesized that glucose will lengthen the distance, insulin will shorten the distance, and the combination of glucose and insulin will lengthen the distance of the crayfish escape reflex. <br><br>Different groups of crayfish were exposed to insulin and glucose in beakers. Every 30, 60, 180, 360, and 1440 minutes the crayfish were placed in a long testing chamber where their escape reflex distance could be measured. Their antennas were touched with a glass rod, which stimulated their escape reflex. <br><br>In the results, contrary to the hypothesis, it was concluded that the glucose tests shortened the escape reflex distance. The insulin test was also contradicting to the hypothesis. This test lengthened the escape reflex distance. The combination of glucose and insulin test went along with the hypothesis. It lengthened the escape reflex distance.

COMPARISON OF NATURAL EXPOSURE TO BORRELIA BURGDORFERI IN FAIRFAX AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY DOGS
Shahleen Zehra Ahmed
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

After experimentation, the data proved my original hypothesis that Montgomery County Dogs had a higher positivity of Lyme Disease than Fairfax County Dogs and that older dogs had higher incidences of Lyme Disease than younger dogs or middle aged dogs. <br><br> The data was placed in a Minitab program and analyzed with multiple Chi Squared tests. In addition, the data showed that there was a strong correlation between Lyme Disease and Population Density in Montgomery County Dogs rather than in Fairfax County Dogs (P value= 0.000 verses P value = 0.119). When Lyme disease was compared to the population densities in Montgomery County, urban areas with human population densities over 3,600 per sq mi had a P value = 0.055, whereas rural/suburban values with a density under 3600 per sq mi had a P value = 0.014. Therefore, most cases of Lyme Disease in Montgomery County come from rural/suburban areas, even though most of the data samples were collected from urban areas. Interestingly, the opposite was true for Fairfax County Dogs. Lyme Disease compared in urban areas had a P value = 0.262 whereas Lyme disease in rural/suburban areas had a P value = 0.497. Though the data is insignificant, it suggests that most cases of Lyme Disease come from urban areas in Fairfax, even though most of the samples were collected from rural/suburban areas.<br><br> To better improve my results, I might have had more significant data if I created three different categories for population density (rural, suburban, and urban) and continued the study to include all 2016 samples. Nonetheless, the lack of a definitive Canine Lyme Database and increased complications in Lyme Disease merits further research into this study.

REDUCTION OF INFLAMMATION INCREASES REGENERATION RATE IN LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATUS
William Marsiglia
Sachem High School East, Farmingville, NY

Inflammation characterized by pain and swelling, is the first step in the wound healing process. Its main purpose is to eliminate any pathogens that may have gained entry through the injury. Pain Relievers (PR’s) are used to minimize the uncomfortable effects of inflammation and may have many other positive effects, such as preventing blood clots and speeding up the wound healing process. To investigate the role of PRs on regeneration rates, Lumbriculus variegatus (California Black worm) was used due its high regeneration capacity and rapid segmental regeneration. Serial dilutions were made of the anti-inflammatory agents: aspirin, ibuprofen, Aloe vera (liquid extract) and Capsaicin. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) was used as a PR with no anti-inflammatory properties; Kaolinite (clay), a pro-inflammatory agent, was used to see if there was a decrease the regeneration rate; and spring water was used for controls. All trials used 3 or 4 worm segments. L. variegatus worms were cut into 1 cm anterior or posterior segments with a sterile scalpel, and segment regeneration was quantified for each group using a digital stereomicroscope. Two different trends were observed: (1) an increase in the concentration of Aspirin and Ibuprofen showed a decrease in regeneration rate, and (2) an increase in the concentration of Aloe vera, Capsaicin and Kaolinite tended to show an increase in regeneration rates. The Pro-inflammatory agent (Kaolinite) worked opposite of what was hypothesized; it had a higher regeneration rate compared to control (4.4 segments/day as compared to 4.3 segments/day of the control) at 1 ug/mL. Overall, the Aspirin (1 X 10-6 mg/mL) had the greatest increase in regeneration rate (5.4 segments/day) compared to control (2.9 segments/day).

SURVEY OF MIGRATION ROUTES FOR BIRDS AT LAKE ROXEN
Adam Daniel Kim Bergner
Berzeliusskolan, Linkoping, SWEDEN

Is it possible to survey the migration routes for birds at the western border of a 97 square kilometer great lake? The aim of this project has been to make a field study of the pattern of behavior on migratory birds, and to identify the migration routes over Lake Roxen in southern Sweden. In addition to behavioral studies and mapping, birds belonging from all species have been counted very carefully during the last three autumns. Thus, a measure of the presence of various species has been obtained. Factors that may affect the presence of different species, such as weather and wind direction, has been taken into account. The method to obtain the material has been pretty easy. The selected observation site has been visited as often as possible, by one or two observers. During the observation period every migratory bird, whatever their nature, has been calculated and studied. Several counting methods have been used. Single birds have been counted and recorded carefully. Large flocks are estimated so that the approximation of the number of birds has been assessed. It requires substantial experience and familiarity in order to succeed in making a proper assessment in the numbers of birds. The results have been exciting. Winds from south and southwest seem to have a positive impact on migratory birds as they increasingly concentrates along the western coastline of the lake Roxen. Several species groups, such as waders and ducks, have also proved to be dependent on following rivers during the migration.

THE NEW SPECIE COQUI "ELEUTHERODACTYLUS JUANARIVEROI": ECOLOGICAL, SPECTROGRAPHYCAL AND GEOGRAPHYCAL DISTRIBUTION STUDY TO FIND RHYTMIC PATTERNS AND BIOACUSTIC BEHAVIOR FOR PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Roberto Carlos Gerena-Lopez
Juan Quirindongo Morell High School, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

A new coqui specie, “llanero coqui” (Eleutherodactylus juanariveroi), was recently discovered in the palustrine wetlands of the northern coast of Puerto Rico. The problem was: can the rhythmic musical patterns and the bioacoustic behavior of “llanero coqui” be used for phylogenetic and socialization analysis? The hypothesis was: if “llanero coqui” has a rhythmic musical pattern and a bioacoustic behavior different from other coqui species, then this can be used as an identification index for phylogenetic and socialization behavior analysis. The rhythmic musical pattern of different “coqui” species was analyzed using a tuner and computer music software to obtain the musical tone. Their bioacoustic vocalization was recorded with a digital recorder and then was analyzed using a sound software to obtain the frequency. These analysis were compared among the different coqui species. The pulse number and frequency were different among the species. A new musical pattern and vocalization frequency was found for “llanero coqui”. Its frequency was the highest one found, within a range of 7.4 to 8.3 kHertz. There are different coqui species living together with “llanero coqui”. An environmental study revealed that the water in their wetland is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria and high levels of nutrients, which endanger the survival of all those coquis.<br><br>It can be concluded that the differences found between rhythmic patterns and frequency respond to phylogenetic relations and socialization behavior.Therefore the bioacoustic behavior and the musical rhythmic patterns can be reported as an identification index of phylogenetic analysis for the different “coqui species”.

THE ATTRACTION OF AURELIA AURITA (MOON JELLYFISH) TO COLORS
Adolfo Rodriguez-Velazquez
Florencia Garcia High School, Las Piedras, PUERTO RICO

The investigator conducted a study related to the attraction of Carrasius auratus (gold fish) to colors during the years 2005 to 2008. Then the investigator wanted to do research with other species of animals which had not been studied for attraction to colors. For this reason, the researcher formulated the problem: "Will Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) be attracted to colors and certain shapes?" The hypothesis was "Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) is attracted to colors and certain shapes." According to literature there is no research to indicate whether this specie has any bias towards shapes and colors. <br><br>The procedure started with the construction of a water tank. This was divided into seven sections. Each section had a different color: black, beige, gold metallic, fluorescent green and white. Three geometric shapes were added into each section covered with the same color of it. The water tank was filled with a solution of water and salt. Twenty-three jellyfish were captured in the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. These were released into the water tank. Four daytime and four night observations were done during fifteen days. The researcher concluded that the hypothesis is true because the specie is attracted to colors with a tilt toward higher fluorescent colors (green) and (black). It was also evidenced that jellyfish are attracted to round objects. As a future study it could be investigated whether the nervous system or a special adaptation of the jellyfish could be related to the discrimination of shapes or colors.

PHOCA HISPIDA FEEDING ECOLOGY AND CONTAMINANT UPTAKE II
Elizabeth Olson Ferreira
Fort Richmond Collegiate, Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA

Phoca hispida (ringed seal) claws contain up to seven visible annular growth layer groups (GLGs) that reflect a longer timeline of contaminant exposure compared to visceral tissue. This study analyzed sections of Phoca hispida claws from Pangnirtung, NU, Canada (n=20) for total mercury as well as stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to monitor changes in ringed seal’s diet and contaminant uptake. Mercury concentrations in the claws were analyzed using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). Stable isotopes ratios of Nitrogen (15N/14N) and Carbon (13C/12C) were determined using continuous flow ion mass spectroscopy (CFIR-MS). There was no significant relationship between THg and d15N values (R=0.074, p=0.458). d13C variation in four juveniles was detected within the tip sections of the claw. This study confirmed that adult Phoca hispida in the Cumberland Sound live sedentarily while juveniles and pups are nomadic.

THE ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ANTIBIOTIC COMPONENTS EXTRACTED FROM MARINE SPONGES
Bernadette Ann Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

Modern bacteria’s resistance to established antibiotics necessitates the discovery of new antibiotics. Incidences of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, rose annually indicating a need for antibiotic development. Marine sponges have produced natural antibiotics. <br><br> This experiment isolated and characterized bioactive components of the marine sponge extracts. I prepared extracts from Pink Sponge, Darwinella mulleri and Blue Sponge, Dysidea camera, testing them on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. I separated each compound into thirteen fractions using flash column chromatography, and tested these on the bacteria. I performed thin layer chromatography (TLC) on both extracts and selected fractions. Two fractions were submitted to a laboratory for HPLC. These studies are directed toward characterizing the bioactive compounds.<br><br> The 13 fractions isolated from each extract demonstrated visible zones of inhibition on both bacteria. Blue Fraction-11 exhibited an 83% increase in zone size over the pure extract and Pink Fraction-8 showed a 33% increase, demonstrating increasingly successful isolation of the bioactive compound. HPLC results of a single major compound for Blue Fraction-11 and two for the Pink Fraction-8 suggest isolation or nearly pure compounds.<br><br> Significantly, all the extracts and fractions inhibited Staphylococcus epidermidis, establishing links to potential antibiotics for MRSA, Staphylococcal infectious bacteria. Developing these antibiotics could expand possibilities in pharmacology. Determination of the structure of the natural antibiotic from each sponge is crucial to prevent depleting sponge populations for their biomass. Identifying antibiotic structures would permit synthetic reproduction, thus conserving the marine sponge population and its fragile environment.

THE EFFECTS OF EUSCHISTUS SERVUS ON REGULATING LEPTINOTARSA DECEMLINEATA
Sadik Uddin
Townsend Harris High School at Queens College, Flushing, NY

Imidacloprid, a pesticide, is used to control the Leptinotarsa decemlineata population, limiting potato plant destruction. Some Leptinotarsa decemlineata develop resistance to imidacloprid. To test whether an olfactory resistant cost exists in resistant Leptinotarsa decemlineata and if Euschistus servus were an effective control, Y-maze trials were conducted. Resistant L. decemlineata selected the Euschistus servus side 87.907% of the time, which was significantly (p<0.001) more often than the susceptible ones, supporting the hypothesis. The results show an olfactory resistant cost exists and that Euschistus servus are is an effective and inexpensive method for controlling resistant Leptinotarsa decemlineata without pesticides.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY ON THE BODY TEMPERATURE OF SLED DOGS
Stephanie Rae LaPointe
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

Sled dogs are trained each fall to prepare them for winter expeditions and races. The dogs pull an ATV over the trails while training. The ambient temperature and relative humidity are monitored to determine whether or not to train the dogs on any given day. The purpose of this project is to record the ambient temperature and relative humidity and the body temperatures of the dogs as they train to determine whether or not there is a relationship between the ambient conditions and the dogs’ body temperatures while training. Initially, the dogs’ temperatures were taken both rectally and under the armpit to determine whether the armpit method would provide reliable results. Although the armpit method produced results that followed a similar pattern to the rectal temperature changes the rectal method was used for the remainder of the experiment. The rectal method provided quicker results and was more accurate. The dogs’ temperatures were taken before each training run as well as at regular intervals during the run. The data indicated that the body temperature of the dogs rose considerably at the beginning of each run and then dropped to a slightly lower temperature. There was not enough data to make a conclusion regarding the relationship between ambient temperature and relative humidity on the body temperature of training sled dogs.

KINETICS OF THE VESICLE FUSION PORE REGARDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION AT THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION OF CRAYFISH
Curtis George Northcutt
Lafayette High School, Lexington, KY

When the nerve terminal of Drosophila is directly stimulated using a focal electrode patch, an increase in calcium within the nerve terminal will result in a decrease in the total duration of the quantal event. In this study, Procambarus clarkii (crayfish) were chosen as the units of experimentation for their many similarities in the basic fundamentals of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with Drosophila and humans. Crayfish allow for the natural build up of residual intracellular calcium within the nerve terminal when stimulated using short-term facilitation. However, instead of stimulating the nerve terminal superficially as was done in previous experiments regarding the relationship between intracellular calcium and the quantal duration, the axon of the excitor nerve was stimulated, inducing an action potential to travel to the nerve terminal as it would naturally. By stimulating the axon in trains of ten stimulation pulses, short-term facilitation (STF) was used to build up residual calcium ions within the nerve terminal. Thus, with each consecutive pulse, there exists a greater [Ca2+] within the nerve terminal. The duration of the quantal events corresponding to each stimulation pulse could then be plotted and analyzed. This experiment was conducted using both 20Hz and 40 Hz frequencies of STF. The data yielded no correlation between the [Ca2+] and the quantal duration for either stimulation frequency. Thus, for the glutamatergic synaptic transmission of Procambarus clarkii, there is no relationship between the residual [Ca2+] and the duration of the quantal event in a physiological setting.

ENTOMOPHAGY: MEALWORMS AS A VIABLE PROTEIN SOURCE FOR HUMANS.
Brenna Elizabeth Keogh
Mohawk Trail Regional High school, Shelburne Falls, MA

Entomophagy is the scientific word referring to using insects as a food source. Entomophagy becomes more important as growing numbers of people on the planet look for environmentally friendly protein sources. This experiment considers domestic entomophagy by investigating aspects of mealworm farming addressing the overarching question: Are mealworms a viable protein source for humans? <br><br> Mealworms are the larval stage of the darkling beetle, an insect that completes metamorphosis. Two factors hypothesized to impact mealworm farming efficiency were examined: diet (protein, normal) and population density (10, 50, 250 mealworms per 350 cubic centimeters). The dependent variables were the amount of biomass increase and the speed of metamorphosis. The hypotheses were that a low density environment and a protein diet would increase the mealworms’ speed of metamorphosis and amount of biomass increase. <br><br> Mealworms were put into 6 containers— 2 of each density and 3 of each diet. Data was collected for 7 weeks. In comparison with the normal diet, the protein diet increased biomass by +6% and metamorphosis by +11%. Each density pupated 70% to 75%. The low and medium densities increased biomass 11% more than the highest density. <br><br> This study demonstrates that a higher protein diet is beneficial to mealworm development and that mealworms can grow successfully in a relatively high density environment. Using this information and other research, it was discerned that to raise mealworms at home, 1 cubic meter of space is needed. As this amount of space is reasonable, mealworms can be raised in homes for a human diet.

DETERMINATION OF VOLUNTARY FOOD INTAKE, AVERAGE DAILY GAIN, AND FEED EFFICIENCY OF YEARLING STANDARDBREDS FED A COMPLETELY PELLETED DIET.
Brian Castro
Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, Chicago, IL

The aim of this study was to determine how much digestible energy (DE) and crude protein (CP) horses will consume under the free choice feeding of a completely pelleted diet between 12 and 18 months of age, as compared to NRC recommended values for horses of this age range. We also wanted to compare the growth rates and feed efficiency (gain: feed ratio) of colts versus fillies in this study. The pelleted diet fed was designed to meet all the digestible energy, crude protein, lysine, minerals and vitamins requirements according to the National Research Council Nutrient Requirements of Horses. <br><br>1. Each horse will be weighted in the beginning of every week. A certain amount of pellet grain was given to each horse in the morning and afternoon.<br><br>2. Food not eaten from horse will be subtracted from the amount given. <br><br>3. Repeat the process for 21 days for every horse- each time increasing the food, if and only if, the horse consumed the amount of grain provided. <br><br>4. After every week, record the weight of every horse and determine the weight gain/weight loss.<br><br>Studies from the NRC show that colts and fillies between 12-18 months of age may consume an average daily intake of 18.8-19.2 mega calories of Digestible Energy. With pelleted diet of voluntary feed intake, colts and fillies consumed 34.33-47.31 mega calories of Digestible Energy. As for Crude Protein, the NRC recommends at least 846-799 grams. Through the pelleted diet of voluntary feed intake, the colts and fillies consumed about 2177.38-3000.28 grams of Crude Protein. As for the total weight gain, colts on average gained 37.75 lbs, fillies on average gained 40.67 lbs. As for the Feed Efficiency on average, colts resulted on .062 and fillies resulted on .066. Although fillies had a slightly numerically higher feed efficiency and a higher average weight gain than colts when fed a completely pelleted diet, the values were very similar.

UTILIZING ORGANIC SUBSTANCES TO SUPPRESS BEAUVERIA BASSIANA IN BOMBYX MORI LARVAE
Peter Bau
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

Beauveria bassiana is a fungus that infects Bombyx mori (silkworm) larvae and destroys them. Thus the silkworm industry faces danger of losing the organisms that produce silk for them. This could have devastating effects on the economies of silk-producing countries. The purpose of these experiments was to test the effects of three organic substances in suppressing B. bassiana infections in silkworm larvae thus safe-guarding organisms needed for a very important industry. Tea tree oil, garlic extract, and green tea were the three organic substances used in these experiments.<br><br>In part I, isolates of B. bassiana were exposed to the substances to determine if they would cause immediate death and inhibit further growth of the mold. In part II of the research, 480 silkworms were divided into different environments with varying percents of humidity (75%, 85%, 85%) and then sub-grouped corresponding to each test substance. One silkworm from each group was inoculated with the B. bassiana and placed back into its respective container. The substances were applied to the silkworms for 14 days and mortalities were recorded. <br><br>The initial hypotheses were rejected. Green tea was not the best inhibitor of fungal growth and penetration of the fungus into the cuticle of the larvae. Instead, tea tree oil was most beneficial in preventing silkworm mortalities with an average of two mortalities in each test group.<br><br>The significance of these findings extends to the global community. Due to B. bassiana’s ubiquitous nature, silkworms are vulnerable when grown in areas of high humidity such as in Southeast Asia. Any fungal infection could be detrimental to silk outputs, greatly affecting one of the primary international textile economies. With the results obtained from this experimentation, farmers can apply tea tree oil to their silkworms to prevent an exponential B. bassiana infection rate. In addition, the antifungal properties on tea tree oil can be used to protect other domesticated insects from infection.

EFFECTS OF FEEDER COLOR AND NECTAR QUALITY ON HUMMINGBIRD FEEDING BEHAVIOR
Alastair Eric Moody
Reno High School, Reno, NV

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if color of nectar feeders was an important visual cue for the feeding of wild hummingbirds. In addition, nectar quality was changed to determine if this could manipulate color preference. <br><br>Procedure: Identical hummingbird nectar feeders were painted four different colors and filled with the same sugar solution. They were placed outside in a square during a time of high hummingbird activity and rotated daily. In the second part of the experiment water was placed in one feeder and the sugar solution in another feeder of a different color. The length of time that hummingbirds fed at the stations was determined by reviewing videotapes of the feeding. <br><br>Results: Over 500 feeding visits were recorded totaling more than 150 minutes. There was variation in preference between the colors and yellow was preferred over green. In the second part of the study hummingbirds spend 25 times as much time at the nectar feeders as at those containing no sugar. This difference was very significant.<br><br>Conclusions: Hummingbirds are able to detect color but, in this setting of unlimited food availability, color preference was less important that nectar quality. The quality of nectar is very important and the birds were much more likely to visit the feeder containing sugar and avoid the other. <br><br>Applications: This experiment suggests the quality and amount of nectar are much more important than color.

MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR THE SEX DETERMINATION OF PHILIPPINE EAGLES (PITHECOPHAGA JEFFERYI)
Jovani Saso Tomale
Davao City National High School, Davao City, Davao del Sur, PHILIPPINES

The Philippine eagle, Pithecophaga jefferyi is one of the most endangered birds in the world. For conservation and preservation purposes, the Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) has been breeding them in captivity, but finds it difficult to distinguish the male from the female since these are sexually monomorphic. <br><br>This study aims to develop mathematical models that can accurately identify the gender of Philippine eagles using morphometric (bill and tarsus) data from PEF. These data went through Cluster Analysis, specifically k-means clustering, and Discriminant Analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software (SPSS).<br><br>Cluster Analysis generated a model consisting of three cluster centers expressed as:<br><br>Cluster i: Distance (x, c¬(i)) = || c(i) ¬– x ||^2<br><br>where i=1 and 3 are female clusters, and i=2 is the male cluster, c(i)’s are the centroids and x’s are log transformation of new bill (height and width) and tarsus (length, dorsal-ventral, and lateral) measurements. Cluster 1 and 3 were found to be adult and young female eagles, respectively. The computed distance (Euclidean) determines to which cluster center a new set of observations belongs.<br><br>Using Discriminant Analysis, the derived model has the following classification functions - <br><br>F1 = 2336.674*tarsus d-ventral – 2946.768*tarsus lateral + <br><br> 2972.487*tarsus circumference – 5772.133,<br><br>and <br><br> F2 = 2185.441*tarsus d-ventral – 2843.456*tarsus lateral + <br><br> 2915.532*tarsus circumference – 5360.115, <br><br>If F1 > F2 the eagle is female, otherwise male.<br><br>The models were validated using the PEF data, which yielded 100% classification success rate. It is recommended that in practice both approaches must be used for greater gender determination reliability.

THE EFFECT OF HUMAN METHAMPHETAMINE USAGE ON CARNIVORE SCAVENGING
Daniel Jeffrey Martin
Desert Vista High School, Phoenix, AZ

Human cadavers located in natural environments are exposed to animal scavengers (e.g.,insects, coyotes, cats, packrats). Animal scavenging often hastens disarticulation and damages or removes flesh and bones from cadavers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that animals do not scavenge from bodies in which methamphetamines are present. This study documents the variation in animal scavenging of cadavers containing varying amounts of methamphetamine, and those with no drug present. Subjects were taken from the Maricopa County Office of the Medical Examiner (MCOME) database containing all decedents (2005-2008) found in a desert or outdoor location and for which toxicology results were available. Ninety-seven cases with periods since death ranging from one day to multiple years were assessed. Demographic data including age, sex, height, weight, ancestry, period since death and toxicology results were obtained, and methamphetamine levels were recorded. Photographs of each decedent were scored using the Rule of 9’s based upon the degree of postmortem carnivore activity. For this study, a score of 0% is equal to complete consumption; a score of 100% indicated no scavenging. The results of this study indicated that the remains of methamphetamine users were less likely to be scavenged than non-users. These data provide important information regarding possible cause of death in those cases where toxicological analysis cannot be performed due to advanced decomposition. No other factors (age, sex, height, weight, ancestry or period since death) had correlation with carnivore scavenging further demonstrating that the presence of methamphetamine was a determining factor in the degree of scavenging.

CRYOPRESERVATION OF THE MICROWORM P.REDIVIVUS
Boram Lee
The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Panagrellus redivivus, also known as the microworm, is a free-living nematode often used in fish aquaculture. Because the P. redivivus has a life span of only two to three weeks, they must be continuously cultured. For both scientific research and aquaculture, it would be highly useful to be able to store worms when they are not needed. The objective of this study was to determine whether microworms can be cryopreserved. Freezing media containing different concentrations of glycerol, trehalose, sucrose, ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and dimethyl sulfoxide were tested using an ordinary household refrigerator and chest freezers (-20°C, and -18°C). The purpose of these cryoprotectants is to prevent lethal damage to cells as a result of intracellular and extracellular ice crystal formations. Various insulations were utilized as well. Preliminary experiments with nematodes frozen for one week showed that nematodes frozen with glycerol as the cryoprotectant had the highest rate of survival. Further experimentation with nematodes cryopreserved over a four-month period, with the addition of a -80°C chest freezer, demonstrated that nematodes can be frozen with the aid of vitrification chemicals over a long period of time. Over a longer period of time, nematodes cryopreserved with sucrose, ethylene glycol, and glycerol survived only at -80°C.

USING NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY TO NON-DESTRUCTIVELY MEASURE EGG NUTRIENT CONTENT
Kayla Marie Dowell
Germann Hills Christian School, Manhattan, KS

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if near-infrared spectroscopy could be used to study egg nutrient content. Using an ASD Quality Spec Pro Near-Infrared Spectrometer, I scanned chicken eggs and then sent them to the USDA ARS poultry lab in Athens, Georgia, for protein and moisture analysis. My statistical analysis showed that protein content was predicted with R2=0.67 and SECV=0.18%, moisture content was predicted with R2=0.72 and SECV=0.53%, and fat content was predicted with R2=0.62 and SECV=0.47%. This indicated that near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to measure nutrients of eggs. The NIR method of measuring nutrients is faster and less expensive than the current lab method. This is the first report of using near-infrared spectroscopy to non-destructively measure the nutrient content of eggs.

DETERMINING HOW TEMPERATURE AFFECTS THE PHENOLOGY OF VANESSA CARDUI
Brianna Sue Morris
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

Butterflies are known to be poikilothermic, making their life-cycle highly dependent on temperature. This makes them an ideal study group for examining the effects of climate change (Filella, Penuelas and Stefanescu, 2003). This project was designed to determine how temperature affects the phenology of Vanessa cardui. It was hypothesized if Vanessa cardui pupae were exposed to various temperatures, then the pupae exposed to the warmest temperature would emerge form their chrysalids first. For this project, Vanessa cardui larvae were purchased. Once the larvae made their chrysalids, they were placed into one of three originally designed habitat chambers. The habitat chambers were 40 cm by 40 cm boxes constructed of building insulation. Trial runs were conducted to obtain the optimum high and low temperatures based on a control temperature of 24 degrees Celsius. In the warmer habitat chamber, a heating pad was placed in the bottom of the insulated box. In the cooler habitat chamber, a Polar Care 300 ice water pump was placed in the top of the insulated box. Nothing was placed into the control habitat chamber. Digital thermometers were placed into the habitat chambers. One strand of white Christmas tree lights connected to timers set to 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark were placed in each habitat chamber. Three separate 30 cm by 30 cm nylon screen boxes were placed inside the habitat chambers to house the pupae during experimentation. The average developmental rates for all three groups are as follows: Group A-141.63 hours, Group B-181.76 hours, and Group C-247.03 hours. F-tests were run to calculate variance in order to determine which Student’s t-Test to use. Based on the p values of the t-Tests, the differences between all three groups were significant, but the greatest significance was found between groups A and C. Based on the data collected, the hypothesis was supported.

CAFFEINE AS A STIMULANT IN DECAPITATED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Jennifer Tracey Janson
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

There has been a proliferation of advertising about “energy boosters.” In this research, Drosophila melanogaster is used as a test organism for over the counter stimulants. The first stimulant studied was caffeine. Carbon dioxide- anesthetized flies were decapitated and those that righted themselves on recovery were selected for experimentation. Severed nerve cords were exposed to pH 6 phosphate buffer or a 0.001 M solution of caffeine. Two- minute movies were immediately captured against a 1-mm grid using a Proscope HR. Movies were analyzed for locomotion, foreleg grooming, hindleg grooming, and hyperactivity. On average, caffeine-exposed flies crossed grid blocks 6.1 times in two minutes vs. 0.8 in the control flies (P = 0.0015). Hindleg grooming occurred an average 77 times in caffeine-treated flies and 37 times in control flies (P = 0.018). There was no significant difference in foreleg grooming. Hyperactivity bordered on statistical significance (P = 0.061) with an average 6 instances in caffeine-exposed flies and 4 in control flies. The caffeine group flipped over about twice to every once the control flipped (P = 0.15). Overall, caffeine seemed to increase most forms of motion in the test flies.

THE BUTTERFLY PROBOSCIS AS A BIOMICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM: A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE VALIDITY OF THE HAGAN POISSEUILLE EQUATION IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A MEDICAL MICROPROBE
Campbell Armstrong Yore
South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, Hartsville, SC

This research project investigated the mechanics of nectar intake in Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus) to develop a medical microprobe which uses similar fluid extraction techniques. The initial goal was to determine if Kingslover’s vacuum pump mechanism, modeled by the Hagen Poisseuille equation, was valid in modeling the butterfly’s feeding process. The validity of this mechanism was determined by calculating the pressure differences butterflies generate when feeding from vessels and drops. These values were consistently calculated to exceed the 1atm upper limit for Kingslover’s vacuum pump centered model. These inconstancies between the results from the feeding experiments and the upper limit of Kingslover’s mechanism led to the proposal of a new feeding mechanism for butterflies centered on capillary force. To further investigate the role of capillary force in butterfly feeding, the Jurin length for a capillary tube of identical radius to a butterfly’s proboscis and the minimum pore radius from which butterflies can extract liquid were measured. The Jurin length was found to be one order of magnitude higher than the entire length of the proboscis and the minimum pore radius was found to be between 1.3-10.0 µm larger than the radius of the proboscis. Both results support the new capillary force feeding mechanism. Contributions of this research to the overall goal of developing a microprobe are twofold. First, pressure differences calculated in these experiments were consistently larger than the upper limit of Kingslover’s vacuum pump mechanism. Second, results from Jurin length and pore radius experiments support the newly purposed capillary force mechanism.

THE EFFECT OF HONEY HYDROGEN PEROXIDE CONCENTRATION ON SMALL HIVE BEETLE (AETHINA TUMIDA) SURVIVAL
Lydia L McCormick
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, AL

Honeybees are natural pollinators and essential in agriculture. Recently, small hive beetle (SHB) (Aethina tumida) infestations have been threatening bee colony health. While current control methods are inadequate, bees may use natural stress defenses in their honey such as hydrogen peroxide (H202). It is produced by glucose oxidase, an enzyme bees secrete into honey. Previous observations (“The Effect of Honeybee Pathogens on H202 Content and Glucose Oxidase Activity in Honey” 2008) revealed that honey H202 concentrations were highest in beehives infested with SHB. The hypothesis that higher honey H2O2 concentrations may decrease SHB survival was tested. <br><br> Groups of 3-5 SHB were incubated with wax-comb, pollen, and experimental honey for 3 months. Nine experimental H202 concentrations (0-6000 microgram/ml) were added to two honey types: natural versus store-bought. Two controls were included: 1) positive control- honey was pre-heated to denature enzymes before adding 1600 microgram/ml H202, and 2) negative control - honey was pre-incubated with catalase to remove native H202. <br><br> Results showed decreased SHB survival in both honey types after 14 days above 1600 microgram/ml H202. By 22-28 days, reduced survival was apparent at 400-800 microgram/ml. At 98 days, all groups above 100 microgram/ml were severely affected. At the lowest concentrations (0-100 microgram/ml H202), beetles showed the most activity and best survival. <br><br> In conclusion, these results support that honey may be a natural long-term defense against SHB. Potential applications of this work could include a rapid field test for honey H202 to monitor colony stress or breeding bees for superior H202 production.

INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CR-GENE IN SELECTIVE BREEDING
Rachel Jean Huber
Starkville Academy, Starkville, MS

The purpose of this project is to see if it is possible to intensify the Cr-gene in chickens by selective breeding, and to see if it is shown in not only mature birds, but embryos as well. It is hypothesized that it is possible to intensify the Cr-gene by selective breeding, and the intensification will be shown in mature and embryonic chickens. The researcher used an incubator, fertile eggs, mature and embryonic chickens, calipers, a balance, and a calculator. The first step was to incubate eggs for 21 days (if they did not hatch they were left in incubator an additional 7 days.)Then the hatched chicks were raised for at least three months, and dead embryonic chickens were removed from incubated eggs for observation. The crests of mature birds were measured in millimeters from side to side, front to back, and top to bottom. The chickens were weighed in grams. The volume of the crest was calculated, and a proportion of crest to weight was also calculated. The crests, caused by the Cr-gene, intensified for four generations, but the fifth generation showed a decrease in the volume of the crest. After taking a proportional measure of the crest volume to weight, it was observed that the crests were proportionately larger each generation. Also, each generation of embryos showed a larger number of fowl that expressed the Cr-gene. In conclusion, the evidence shows it is possible to intensify the Cr-gene in chickens by selective breeding. The results are indicated in mature chickens by proportionate measures and are indicated in embryonic chickens by visible evidence.

THE EFFECTS OF HYPOXIA AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURE ON THE GROWTH AND SURVIVORSHIP OF BARNACLES
Christopher Ryan Peterson
Ocean Springs High School, Ocean Springs, MS

The effects of hypoxia and elevated temperatures on barnacles were studied in a controlled environment. It was hypothesized that both hypoxia and high temperature would cause a decrease in survivorship and growth, and that a combination of the factors would cause a greater decrease. The barnacles settled on 4 groups of 4 boards each for 8 weeks. The boards were cleaned and photographed. The barnacles were then placed in tanks of 15 ppt seawater, and were fed brine shrimp twice a day. The groups were designated Hypoxic/Warm (HW), Hypoxic/Cool (HC), Normoxic/Warm (NW), and Normoxic/Cool (NC). The dissolved oxygen (DO) in the hypoxic tanks was decreased to 2 ppm, and the temperature in the warm tanks was increased from 27 °C to 33 °C. Each week the dead barnacles were removed and the boards were photographed. After three weeks, the barnacles were identified as Balanus eburneus and B. improvisus. The number of barnacles on each board were counted from the image, and 10 surviving barnacles on each board were measured in weeks 0 and 3. Statistical analysis showed that NC had significantly higher survivorship than any other group, HW had significantly lower survivorship than any other group, and that there was no difference between NW and HC. Furthermore, there was an overall negative survivorship trend, and HW had significantly less growth than any other group. The hypothesis was supported. This suggests that global climate change could worsen the impacts of coastal hypoxia.

IDENTIFYING HABITATS OF POISON DART FROGS: LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND FROG DISTRIBUTION
Gabriel Thailand Joachim
Cibola High School, Albuquerque, NM

All over the world frogs are dying off at an alarming rate. Consequently herpetologists worldwide are rushing to conserve the frog species by putting them into sanctuaries. The purpose of my project is to understand two particular species of frogs so we might better conserve them. From 2004-2008 I began a longitudinal study censusing two species of poison dart frogs in Costa Rica. In addition more recently I have begun to pinpoint the combination of factors that lead to the distribution of frogs in certain habitats. Based on my own previous work I hypothesize that Dendrobatids will prefer interior undisturbed areas of the forest with high bio-diversity, particular temperature, and unpolluted soil with high relative humidity. My hypothesis is based on my 2007 results on biodiversity as well as the physiology of frogs. In particular, because frogs are poikiothermic and breath through there skin I assume that they will be sensitive to changes in temperature, relative humidity and soil characteristics. Results suggest that frogs prefer Riverine Disturbed and Interior Undisturbed habitats. A statistical comparison within and across forests showed a difference in temperature, Relative Humidity, biodiversity, and soil between frog and no frog areas. I suggest that a combination of these factors influences frog presence; no one factor is solely responsible.

"AGE OF SCALE-INFESTED CYCAD PLANT AFFECTS PREDATORY BEETLE BEHAVIOR"
Paris Nicole Marler
St. Johns School, Tumon Bay, GUAM

An olfactometer was used to determine the relative level of attraction that "Rhyzobius lophanthae" (an introduced predatory beetle) exhibited toward "Aulacaspis yasumatsui" (an invasive scale) that was infesting mature versus seedling leaves of the endemic and endangered "Cycas micronesica". This predator protects mature plants from the pest on the island of Guam, thus sustaining the cycad population; but recruitment of seedlings does not occur because the predator does not protect seedlings from the pest. I used three scenarios in the two-choice olfactometer: scenario 1 – infested mature cycad leaf vs. empty chamber; scenario 2 – infested seedling cycad leaf vs. empty chamber; scenario 3 – infested mature cycad leaf vs. infested seedling cycad leaf. Each test was completed when ten beetles reached one of the two choices for each scenario, and each scenario was repeated four times. For scenario 1, the beetles preferred the infested mature leaf choice to the empty chamber 5.7 to 1. For scenario 2, the beetles preferred the infested seedling leaf to the empty chamber 1.7 to 1. For scenario 3, the beetles preferred the infested mature leaf to the infested seedling leaf 2.1 to 1. I have demonstrated that a scale-infested seedling leaf does attract the beetles, therefore lack of an olfactory attractant is not the reason the predatory beetles have failed to protect the seedlings in the forest.

FACTORS AFFECTING COLIC
Megan Elisabeth Brown
The Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

Colic is the number one killer of horses today. The most common form of colic is sand colic, intestinal distress caused by sand buildups pressing down on the intestines or causing blockages and ruptures. In this experiment, four different factors: diet, exercise, housing, and gender, were tested to determine their effects on a horse’s probability of getting sand colic. It was hypothesized that housing, diet, and exercise would affect the sand build ups while gender would not.<br><br> Thirty horses were used to gather fresh feces samples. Each sample of feces went through a filtration process in which the sand in the fecal matter was separated from the organic matter that the horses had not digested.Water was added to the fecal samples and was shaken to loosen the organic matter. The plant matter and sand would settle in layers by density. The sand was isolated by straining the plant matter from the water and sand and then filtering the sand from the water with coffee filters. The sand was then massed and the percentage of sand in each sample of feces was calculated. Information, such as daily diet, number of hours exercised weekly, housing, and gender, was collected for each horse. The percentages calculated were compared among horses in regards to each of these factors and plotted on a series of graphs and charts to make any correlations between data visible. <br><br> It was found that three of the four factors seemed to have a definite effect on the percent of sand in a horse’s feces. Diet, hours exercised, and housing had an effect on the percent sand while the gender of a horse did not appear to have a definite effect. therefore, the hypothesis was not rejected. Out of all of these factors, however, it was determined that exercise was the most important factor because, while diet and housing affect the long-term buildup of sand, one hour of exercise can break up blockage that had been building up for months. Some unusual findings in these results were the fact that the majority of horses having higher percentages of sand were males, lived in pastures, and were the dominant male in their pasture. Some horses tested were on medication for previous injuries or illness during testing had lower percentages of sand than the other horses.

BEETLE MANIA: DOES THE HEALTH OF TROPICAL SODA APPLE HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION RATE OF THE GRATIANA BOLIVIANA BEETLE?
Todd Joseph Condon Jr.
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

The objective of this project was to evaluate the effect of host-plant quality on the immature survival and adult reproductive rate of the Gratiana boliviana beetle. This beetle is a biological control agent that feeds only on the invasive weed tropical soda apple. Two experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions in central Florida. First, ten neonate larvae of G. boliviana were placed on caged tropical soda apple plants that were fertilized weekly, and plants that were grown without fertilizer (control). The plants were checked weekly and the survival of each immature was recorded. The average number of surviving G. boliviana beetles reared on the fertilized plants was 7.5, compared to 5.7 on the control plants.<br><br>For the second experiment, the adults obtained from the previous experiment (fertilized and control plants) were sexed and evenly divided into nine groups each comprised of seven individuals. Each group of adults was placed on fertilized or control plants. The plants were checked weekly and the number of surviving adults and eggs were counted for a period of 30 days. The average number of eggs laid per female in the fertilized plants was 85.5 compared to 18.8 in the control plants. <br><br>In conclusion, Gratiana boliviana beetles reared on higher quality host-plants (fertilized) had greater survival and reproduction rate, opposed to those living on the lower quality tropical soda apple plants. The practical applications of these findings include the improvement of mass rearing of the beetle and the selection of healthier stands for field releases.

Ticks are of the most economically important external parasites of livestock and game in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, including South-Africa. Livestock –and game farmers, lose millions of rands every year due to especially the damage caused to the ears of cattle and game by brown ear ticks (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus). Previous methods in tick control for cattle and game apply acaracides via very expensive, fixed equipment, which is not very effective in rainy seasons when animals cannot be lured to water or feeding points.<br><br>This research focused on the application of acaracides via a paintball gun capsule and thus applied from a distance to selected animals. During this research an appropriate acaracide was selected, capsules were developed; the practical application via a paintball gun and the effect on the animals’ skin investigated and the efficacy of the applied acaracide on the tick numbers in animals’ ears were assessed.<br><br>It was found that the application of acaracide to the upper neck of animals, via a capsule fired from a paintball gun, significantly reduced the numbers of brown ear ticks on treated animals vs. untreated controls, however further research is needed on the impact on animal’s behavior.<br><br>This method will be of benefit for the treatment of brown ear ticks to animals in the not so easily accessible bushy areas.

THE EFFECTS OF SUCRALOSE ON THE GROWTH OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Victoria Anne Joyal, Robert Coday Hudson, 
CAT/Lakewood High School, St. Petersburg, FL

The purpose of this project was to observe and to analyze the effects of sucralose on the growth of wild, vestigial winged, white eyed, and apterous fruit flies. The goal of this project is to determine the possibility of sucralose's toxicity as a food additive. Our team hypothesized that the presence of sucralose in the fruit flies' food supply would cause an effect on the growth and reproduction capabilities of the organisms. <br><br> Our procedure consisted of reviewing the ISEF rules and regulations, then proceeding to assemble five vials of fruit fly media with five male and five female flies in each for each of our experimental and control groups (samples of wild, vestigial winged, white eyed, and apterous fruit flies in 0M (control), 0.01M, 0.1M, and 0.5M sucralose-fortified media). The concentration of sucralose in each media group was distinguished by the molarity of sucralose in the water added to the dry media. Each group of flies was given an incubation period (at 30°C) of fourteen days before the population was re-counted and recorded. We then analyzed the population counts of each group and observed patterns in the population growth due to sucralose concentrations in the media. <br><br> Our data indicates that there were average population growths of 1885.00% in control groups, 2111.50% in 0.01M sucralose groups, 421.50% in 0.1M sucralose groups, and -95.00% in 0.5M sucralose groups. We have made two conclusions based on these figures. The presence of 0.01M sucralose in the media caused no significant decline in population; additionally, the presence of 0.1M and 0.5M sucralose concentrations in the media inhibited the growth and reproduction of the fruit flies.

MOODY BLUE: A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF BLUE LIGHTS ON VITILIGOUS AND COMMERCIAL CHICKENS.
Ashley Dawn Smith, Lesley Smith, 
Alpena High School, Alpena, AR

The purpose of this project is to see if standard blue lights have a calming effect on Vitiligous Smyth line chickens, delay or prevent the symptoms of Vitiligo, and the impact on Smyth Line chickens and commercial chickens feed/weight gain efficiency. <br><br> <br><br>The chickens were housed individually and the control group was placed under standard white lights and the experimental group under blue lights. At weeks 5-9, a scoring guide of 1-5 was used to rate the severity of the Smyth line chickens' Vitiligo ("1" showing no white and no sign of Vitiligo and "5" showing all white and the Vitiligo condition). Also calculated was the chickens' feed conversion and efficiency. <br><br> <br><br>It was found that the Smyth line chickens showed significant differences with the control group, scoring an average of 1.3 and the blue group scoring 1.5 (p<0.025169). We found significant differences for our feed conversion in the commercial chickens (p<0.031699). Even though there were no significant differences in our feed efficiencies, the commercial chickens in the blue group had the better efficiency. <br><br> <br><br>In conclusion, it was found that the commercial chickens in the control group weighed slightly more each week than those in blue light. However, the commercial chickens in the blue group had a better feed conversion as well as a better efficiency. The Smyth line chickens in the blue group had a slightly higher score of Vitiligo than in the control group.

DIFFERENCES IN CONDITION OF OVERWINTERING COHO SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS KISUTCH) FROM TWO DIFFERENT STREAMS IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA
Robin Lucien Woodby, Nick Wolf Parker, 
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

Little is known about the change in condition of salmon over winter even though winter conditions may affect their survival. A better understanding of winter’s effects on salmon could help explain variation in salmon returns. To study how salmon condition changed over winter we captured juvenile coho salmon between November 2008 and February 2009 from two streams near Juneau, Alaska: Peterson and Montana Creeks. As measures of condition we recorded RNA/DNA ratios, length-adjusted dry mass, and lipid content. Previous work showed coho losing lipid and dry mass in winter, but no work has been done with RNA/DNA ratios. We hypothesized that RNA/DNA levels in fish would also decrease over winter. Our hypothesis was rejected. We saw no change in the lipid, length-adjusted dry mass or RNA/DNA over time in the streams. We concluded that coho do not deteriorate in condition over winter. However, lipid and RNA/DNA ratios were significantly higher in Peterson Creek. We conclude that Peterson Creek is a better wintering habitat for coho than Montana Creek. A comparison of the dry mass of fish from the two streams in November, the month when they were simultaneously sampled, showed no difference, but the average length of fish from Peterson Creek was longer than Montana Creek. Increased length, RNA/DNA, and lipid indicate better growing conditions in Peterson Creek in winter. Concurrence between RNA/DNA and the other condition measures indicates RNA/DNA ratios may be a good indicator of fish condition.

AGRICULTURAL PROXIMITY AND CATTLE ACCESS TO FRESHWATER PONDS INCREASE TREMATODE PREVALENCE WITHIN FIRST INTERMEDIATE SNAIL HOSTS
Felicia Anne King, Rogan Kriedt, 
Pacific Collegiate School, Santa Cruz, CA

Increased amphibian malformations have been recognized as one of the driving factors in the decline of many amphibian populations. Analyzing the cause of these malformations is essential to protecting amphibian populations. In lab and field settings, parasitic trematode infections have been linked to these malformations.<br><br>Anthropomorphic eutrophication is a growing concern; we examined environmental effects assumed to be caused by runoff from agriculture and livestock upon freshwater ponds and their prevalence of trematode infections.<br><br>Our purpose was to describe the trematode and snail communities, determine prevalence of trematode infections in snails, and establish potential correlations between nutrient levels and trematode prevalence.<br><br>We randomly sampled 534 snails from 27 ponds in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties California. For each pond we recorded topography and microhabitates. Snails were collected along the periphery and along transects. <br><br>In the lab, snails were keyed, measured, and dissected to indentify trematode infections. Slides were made of isolated trematodes to analyze and identify the cercariae.<br><br>We observed a strong correlation between agricultural proximity and infection prevalence (Student’s t, Comparison of Mean, P=0.00089) and a strong correlation between cattle access to ponds and infection prevalence within a single property, which relieved concerns of special-auto correlation (Comparison of Mean, P=0.025). We noted a strong positive correlation between the actual infection levels and those predicted by micro-environmental infection trends that strengthens the argument that there is a distinct correlation between the parasite-host exposure to high nutrient levels and the infection prevalence to trematode flatworms (Student’s t, Slope Test, P<0.0001).

THE EFFECT OF PRE-BIRTH LEARNING ON CUTTLEFISH
Timothy Joseph Higgins, Eric David Morris, 
South County Secondary School, Lorton, VA

The cuttlefish are marine invertebrates under the order Sepiida and belonging to the Cephalopoda class. The Sepia pharaonis is a tropical species of cuttlefish that live in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. With unusually large eyes and high intelligence the cuttlefish has a biological advantage over most other marine species. It is theorized that the cuttlefish can absorb visual cues through their clear embryonic sac before birth, suggesting pre-birth learning. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that if cuttlefish embryos are exposed to an environment where they observe creatures other then their natural diet, they will tend to eat those animals instead of their innate tendency to eating shrimp. Three salt water tanks were set up, each containing five cuttlefish embryos. In tank one the embryos observed nothing, serving as the control. Tank two contained cuttlefish observing crabs, but separated by a clear barrier. Tank three contained the cuttlefish observing shrimp and crabs, while being separated by a clear barrier. Twenty-four hours after hatching from their embryonic sacs, the clear barrier was removed from tanks two and three. An equal number of shrimp and crabs were added to all three tanks allowing the cuttlefish to interact and feed on the desired species of their choice. Five days after the cuttlefish hatched, it was determined that the cuttlefish preferred to feed on the species in which they observed while developing in their embryonic sacs. This research supports the theory that pre-birth learning is capable of occurring with the Sepia pharaonis species.

DETECTION OF BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS IN SALAMANDER POPULATIONS OF TRANSYLVANIA COUNTY
Brooke Elizabeth Burrows, John Burrows, Matthew Travers
Brevard High School, Brevard, NC

With recent speculation proposing Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the chytrid fungus) as a contributing factor in the global decline of amphibians, the initial goal of our project was to determine if there was a presence of the fungus in Transylvania County, NC salamanders and if so to identify trends in location, infected species, and environmental conditions.<br><br> Potential sites for salamander testing were identified by proximity to water, accessibility, and diversity in environmental conditions. The collection was completed using nets, markers to facilitate the return of the amphibians to their original location, and plastic bags to prevent cross-contamination. Each salamander was identified, measured, and swabbed. Swabs were grouped by species per location. The swabs were placed in an ethanol solution prior to being sent to the Pisces Molecular Lab for PCR analysis.<br><br> Two of 29 grouped samples returned a positive result for B. dendrobatidis. Aneides aeneus, the endangered Green Salamander, and Eurycea wilderae, the Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander, tested positive for the fungus. The infected salamanders were collected in a rock outcrop in Dupont State Forest and in Kings Creek, respectively.<br><br> At each testing site, environmental data were recorded along with a GPS location and chemical tests. Although it was hypothesized that locations with more obvious pollution and usage would harbor the fungus, there was no indication of this with the initial data collection. With two different species at two separate locations testing positive, there was not enough data to draw conclusions about the spread of B. dendrobatidis.

THE EARTHWORM MARVELS REVEALED: PROPOSING A MODEL OF UNDERGROUND LOCOMOTION
Thakerng Soimadee, Wasawat Muninthorn, Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn
Triam Udom Suksa School, Bangkok, THAILAND

Our research project presents an idea of earthworm’s locomotion. The purpose of this study is to find a model which can be used to explain the locomotion of earthworm (Metaphire posthuma) as it moves through the underground. First, earthworms were collected at Triam Udom Suksa School, Bangkok, Thailand, and the experiment apparatus was set on flat ground for observing the locomotion. The total body volume and length of the earthworms used in the experiment were also recorded. It was found that when the earthworms moved forward, the wave-like appearance was formed from anterior- to posterior-end and their total body volume was not relatively differed. When earthworms shortened or contracted the bodies, their heads became "round and plump" and anchored to the surrounding soils by setae. In contrast, when they lengthened or elongated the bodies, their heads became "fastigiate" and pulled up their setae. After the detailed observation of earthworms was performed, a model was created using by comparing the movements with the spring-mass system. The elastic property resulted from waves of muscular contractions was represented by coiling springs. The weight of earthworms was used to represent the inertia of body whereas the setae were to represent the friction. The model explained that earthworms could perform their locomotion by means of the muscular contractions waves, alternately shortening and lengthening the body. In addition, the setae played an important role as an anchor which could help prevent the body from slipping, thus, allowing the earthworms to shove forward through soil more efficiently. The results of this model could be the key to 'fastigiate transformation' and 'plump and round transformation' in order to reduce the resistance from soil and create lubricated tunnels to draw their bodies when shoving forward, respectively. As an application, this model of earthworm’s locomotion could be used as a basic to build a prototype robot in which we expect it to be the basis of our future subterranean transport system, like an underground planet explorer.

WHAT CAN YOU STOMACH?
Grant Michael Magdanz, Taylor Everett, 
Kotzebue High School, Kotzebue, AK

Stenodus leucichthys, locally called sheefish, are the largest member of the whitefish family found in Arctic and subarctic rivers and estuaries. Studies have explored sheefish distribution, population, spawning location, and spawning behavior, but have not focused on their winter behaviors, especially feeding. The project objective was to determine whether sheefish feed during December and January and, if so, on what? Based on local knowledge, we hypothesized that sheefish do eat, and they eat primarily Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi).<br><br> From subsistence nets set under the ice in Hotham Inlet in Northwest Alaska, we sampled 20% of five catches of sheefish. In total, 49 fish were sampled. The fish were sexed, measured, and weighed. Then the entire digestive tracts were removed, weighed, and emptied, and the contents alone were weighed. Then the stomachs and their contents were examined.<br><br> In total, the 49 digestive tracts contained 16 identifiable fish, 65 unidentifiable fish, 15 shrimp, and 1 isopod. From pictures, two fish biologists identified the fish as Pacific herring and the shrimp as northern pink shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and tank shrimp (Argid or Crangon spp.). <br><br> The data showed that sheefish in Hotham Inlet used a variety of food sources in December and January. Scientists are planning additional sheefish studies, including a DNA study. It would help scientists to know as much as possible about sheefish beforehand. Feeding studies are an important aspect of ichthyology and this study contributed new and specific knowledge of sheefish in Northwest Alaska.

THE EFFECTS OF OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION ON THE HEART RATE OF DAPHNIA MAGNA AND ITS IMPLICATIONS TO HUMAN CARDIOLOGY
Angshylea O'lesizisa Jones, Kayla Coleman, 
Jim Hill High School, Jackson, MS

Throughout the experiment three methods were used. Method one: use different concentrations of each pain reliever. Method two: compare body weight to dosages by creating equations that would equal out to a normal amount taken by a human. Method three: solve equations to find which dosage given to the daphnia would be most accurate to human beings. Following through the experiment some Daphnia died because of too many high concentrations of medicine, environment was interrupted, and toxicity to the anatomy. <br><br>• Method one: Concentrations were broken down from lose dose to high dose. The concentrations were as followed: .025g, .25g, and 2.5g. The powder substances of the medications were diluted in 100mL spring water in labeled baby food jars. The water was warmed (2minutes) so the powdered medications can be completely dissolved.<br><br>• Method two: By reading the labels on the backside of the bottles we observed that dosage depends on body weight. To have accurate results, we converted the Daphnia’s body weight into human body weight and human dosages into Daphnia’s dosages for medication.<br><br>• Method three: After finding the correct body weight and dosages for a Daphnia Magna, we compared it to a natural human dosage and body weight to observe how the lethal dosage affects the cardiac cells, muscles, blood pressure, and other bodily organs.<br><br>This project establishes that in addition to the dosing requirements indicated by the manufacturer body weight and metabolic rate must be taken into consideration. Over the counter pain remedies increase heart rate in Daphnia magna and by inference human heart rate will be increased as a result of these medications.

MODERN SCIENCE VS. AGE-OLD REMEDIES
Apas Aggarwal, Divya Shenoy, 
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

As modern medicines develop, we often think to discard the old ones. To determine whether these age-old remedies are more effective than our modern cures, we concocted an experiment using an Ayurvedic nutritional supplement, Zrii, versus a liquid multivitamin, Centrum. We tested the solutions on brown planaria (Dugesia dorotocephala) and through serial dilution, we placed them in varying concentrations of Zrii, Centrum, and holding solution. We then observed activity for 2 weeks and noticed that the planaria were able to survive in the human dosages, 1 X 10-5 Zrii mL, 2 X 10-6 mL Centrum, and the 10mL holding solution. Then, placing 10 planaria in each human dosage, we analyzed division. After 10 days, there were 0 divisions in the Zrii, 1 division in the Centrum (after 5 days), and 1 division in the holding solution (after 10 days). Moving on to study regeneration, we took 3 planaria from the Zrii, Centrum, and holding solutions and cut them at the pharynx. We then looked at regeneration and created a ranking system. After 10 days of observation, we graphed our results and saw that in looking at both head to tail and tail to head regeneration, the planaria in the Centrum appeared to regenerate their lost parts quicker than those in the Zrii did. Thus, we’ve seen twice that the Centrum seems more effective than the Zrii, and consequently, between these 2 solutions, it appears that our modern science is indeed more effective than our age-old remedies.

THE EFFECT OF CAFFEINE ON RETENTION IN DUGESIA TIGRINA(PLANARIA)
Jennifer I. Onyewuenyi, Lizzy O'Connor, 
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of caffeine on retention. Using Brown planarian, Dugesia tigrina, we were able to monitor the planaria’s ability to complete a standard Y-Maze, while introducing the stimulus (caffeine found in energy drinks) after the learning had been established. We hypothesized that the presence of caffeine in different concentrations would lead to a hindrance of retention in the planaria in solving the maze. First, we needed to condition the planaria: in the experiment, we used negative reinforcement to increase the occurrence of the desired behavior. After a couple days of this initial training period we added different concentrations of caffeine to each experimental group’s water in the form of diluted energy drink, in order for the animals to absorb the caffeine and for us to test their retention. After the planaria were exposed to caffeine, they correctly decided and retained the learning fifty four percent less of the time (p-value = 0.01009). The null hypothesis was rejected, supporting the hypothesis that the planaria’s retention capacity was hindered by the addition of caffeine to their environment. Further experimentation using a different animal, longer training time, and longer exposure times would be beneficial.

PREDATION OF G. BOLIVIANA (COLEOPTERA: CHRYSOMELIDAE) EGGS BY TUPIOCORIS NOTATUS (HEMIPTERA: MIRIDAE)
Eloise Jayne Cave, Melody Santana, 
St. Lucie West Centennial High School, Port St. Lucie, FL

Gratiana boliviana is an important biological control agent of the invasive weed tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum) in Florida. Tupiocoris notatus is a common sap-feeding herbivore that feeds on TSA. Field sampling across Florida suggests that T. notatus is the most common herbivore found on tropical soda apple and in certain occasions it has been observed feeding upon immature stages of G. boliviana. <br><br> Our research question is under what circumstances does T. notatus feed on G. boliviana eggs? We discussed many environmental circumstances and came to a conclusion to test egg density on TSA leaves, starvation of suckflies, and water stress on TSA plants.<br><br> We tested egg density to see if the amount of eggs on one leaf would affect the suckfly. Four treatments were used with 1, 2, 6 and 10 eggs, ten replicates each. 2 cm2 TSA squares were cut and put in individual Petri dishes with certain number of eggs and one suckfly. The conclusions show that there is a pattern. The suckflies predated more when the egg count was higher.<br><br> Our second experiment was starvation of suckfly for 0, 4, and 24 hours. Three treatments were used with ten replicates each. Then we introduced the suckflies to five eggs in each Petri dish. We concluded that starvation does affect the suckfly. Longer periods of time of starvation stimulate the suckfly to predate more on the eggs. <br><br> Water stress consists of four plants, two with normal irrigation and two with no irrigation. After plants show signs of water stress we inoculated them with 15 suckflies each. After four days, introduce suckflies to Petri dishes with five eggs. The data shows no difference between “water” and “dry” treatments. Therefore, we believe that water stress does not affect the suckflies feeding habit.

EFFECTS OF OVEREXPRESSION AND DELETION OF TBPH GENES ON MOTOR FUNCTION OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Joshua Miles Dreyzen
Southridge High School, Beaverton, OR

ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans. The TDP-43 protein has been implicated as an important factor in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. In Drosophila melanogaster, TBPH has been identified as an ortholog of TDP-43. Scientists in my lab created several lines for which TBPH was partially deleted. In another line, TBPH was overexpressed in motor neurons using the GAL4-UAS system. My experiment analyzed the effect of these TBPH gene modifications on the speed of larval crawling. I also incorporated peristaltic wave frequency by counting the number of peristaltic waves in the linear locomotion burst. This allowed me to find waves/second and distance/wave in larval crawling. Thus, I could find which aspect of crawling speed was decreased, and therefore assess whether the deficiency in crawl speed results is due to only to deleterious effects in motor neurons, or whether the central pattern generator (part of the CNS) is somehow involved. I discovered that both deletion and overexpression significantly reduce crawling speed of drosophila larvae. Furthermore, this deficiency is a result of fewer waves per second, not less distance per wave, as previously hypothesized. The fact that all TBPH-modified lines showed fewer waves per second suggests that the CPG is involved, since there was a change in rhythmic motion. So, I determined that, for the TBPH modifications, the CPG remains intact, but TBPH modifications most likely prevent the motor neurons from properly receiving signals fired by the CPG, and so wave rate, and hence overall crawling speed, is reduced.

EXAMINING DIETARY PREFERENCES IN MANOURIA EMYS BASED ON OLFACTORY AND VISUAL CUES: A BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF FOOD SELECTION, YEAR SIX OF THE M. EMYS INVESTIGATIONS
Richard Schinco Schaffer
Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, FL

Manouria emys is a critically endangered Southeast Asian tortoise. Assurance colonies, where animals are bred in captivity, later to be repatriated if conditions improve, are desperately needed. Only anecdotal information exists for diet, thus necessitating study.<br><br> This study involved 51 Manouria emys. An pilot study examined relative food preference among 18 different food items. Three top foods were studied further to ascertain straight food preference as well as the impact of visual and olfactory cues in determining food preference.<br><br>For the pilot study, the top food choice was Xanthoma. It was chosen in 40 of 51 trials (78.43%). The other top four dietary items were corn (33 times/64.71%), banana (29 times, 56.86%), mushrooms, and papaya (both 28 times/ 54.90%) tied for fourth. Aroids were excluded due to their controversial and exclusive nature.<br><br>The next trial of straight food preference included only the top three dietary items. Corn was chosen most often (116 of 249 trials/46.59%), followed by mushrooms (58 times/23.29%), and bananas (37 times/19.61%). <br><br>This was followed by visual and olfactory trials, both of which again yielded corn as the most popular dietary item (27 out of 153/17.65% and 48 of 153 trials/31.37%, respectively). However, in both of these trials, there were increased occurrences of “no preference” (53.59% and 42.48% versus 15.26% in straight food preference trials), thus tortoise confusion. The animals have obvious preferences and use multiple senses for food selection.

TESTING METHODS TO ISOLATE AND GROW EQUINE LAWSONIA INTRACELLULARIS
Samantha Kay Welu
Marshall Senior High School, Marshall, MN

The purpose of my project is to try to isolate Lawsonia intracellularis from an equine fecal sample. A horse farm in my area has been having yearly problems with lawsonia outbreaks. The lawsonia is caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, which was first discovered in the 1990's and is a hard bacterium to isolate. There was one foal that had contracted suspected lawsonia this year, which I made a part of my project. Because of the seriousness of the health of the foal, I treated it with avian antibodies to swine Lawsonia.<br><br> To start with, I collected a fecal sample from the foal, and streaked it out onto agar plates, grew it, and gram stained the slides. I isolated some strains of Staph. and Strep., but not L. intracellularis. Then, I tried to infect McCoy cells with L. intracellularis in tissue culture flasks by centrifuging the bacteria into the cells, and by just adding the bacteria to the cells. I was able to infect them through centrifuging, therefore when I isolate the bacteria, I can grow it in McCoy cells. Next, I ran an ELISA test to see if L. intracellularis would bind to specific antibodies. When I analyzed the results, I found some cell interference, and thus made the numbers somewhat unreliable. Next, I did an immunofluorescence assay.<br><br> In conclusion, I was not able to isolate L. intracellularis due to the special needs of the bacteria. I would have liked to do a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, but the lab did not have the equipment to run the test. Next year, I would like to make an egg based product to administer to the foals to prevent the lawsonia.

THE EFFECT OF PLUMAGE COLORATION ON EXTRA-PAIR PATERNITY IN THE INDIGO BUNTING
Eugenia Pushkarskaya
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Socially-monogamous birds often produce offspring that do not genetically match the social father. This phenomenon, known as extra-pair paternity, is prevalent in the majority of avian populations; however, the role of male morphological traits contributing to such variation remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the role of plumage coloration on extra-pair paternity in Indigo Buntings. This study consisted of two phases. In the first phase Indigo Buntings were measured, banded, and samples were taken by the qualified scientist. In the second phase, feather samples were quantified in terms of saturation, hue, and brightness for each captured male. In addition, extra-pair paternity was assigned by comparing the genotypes of males and nestlings using PCR and gel electrophoresis. Logistic regression tests showed that the average hue of the throat and rump areas is negatively correlated with the incidence of extra-pair paternity. This demonstrates that “bluer” males have significantly more extra-pair nestlings in their nests and could be considered lower quality males.

HOW MUCH WORM IS A WORM?
Monica Michelle Hernandez
Okeechobee Freshman Campus, Okeechobee, FL

The purpose of the experiment was to determine how much of a worm can be left to be able to regenerate. My hypothesis was that the worm will be able to regenerate if no more than half of its body is cut.<br><br>The main materials used were compost, plates, cups, worms, rubber bands, and saran wrap. Fifteen worms were divided into three groups equally: Group A, Group B, and Group C. One worm was used as a "Control." The 5 worms in Group A had 1/4 of its tail cut off> Group B had 1/2 of its tail cut off. The 5 worms in Group C had 3/4 of its tail cut off. All worms were placed in cups and stored in a cool, dark place. Every three days, observations were done and recorded.<br><br>The results of this experiment were that when the worm was cut more than half its size, it died. Both Group A and Group B stayed alive and regenerated. On the other hand, all the worms in Group C died. The "Control" remained alive during the whole experiment.<br><br>After careful analysis of the data, I concluded that my data does not support my hypothesis. Both Group A and Group B survived and regenerated. Unlike Group C, which more than half of it was cut off, died. All the worms in Group C probably died because of its fairly small size and it had barely any of its body left, just its head.

USING TOADS: AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF DESTROYING INSECTS
Phuong Thi Xuan Doan
Duc Trong High School, Duc Trong, Lam Dong, VIETNAM

Nowadays, most farmers use more pesticides to protect vegetables, which causes bad outcomes such as adversely affecting human’s health and environmental pollution. From the idea of producing fresh vegetables that are not harmful to human health, I made a project entitled "Using toads - an effecttive method of destroying insects”. <br><br> In the project, I conducted 2 experiments. Firstly, to test the toad’s ability to kill insects, pests and to protect the vegetables, Two vegetable gardens with the same area of 100m2 were used. In one garden (1) 5 toads were present. In the other there were 10 toads. After 20 days, some insects were still found in first one(about 5 insects per 1 square meter); Meanwhile, no insects were found in the latter. Next, for comparison, two vegetable gardens of 500 m2 were used. In one garden, 32 toads were applied to kill insects to protect vegetables.In the other, pesticides were used instead of toads. After 20 days of observation, the vegetables in the garden with toads developed as well as the other without being destroyed by insects.However,the quality of vegetables was different as a small amount of toxin still remained on vegetables sprayed with pesticides. Using toads as insect killers is obviously beneficial, economical and good for consumers' health.<br><br> Based on the result of the experiments and characters of the toads, this method was proved to be feasible and profitable.In addition, it made a small contribution to protect our enviroment which is highly polluted partly by using pesticides to protect crops in general, vegetables in particular.

ARE THE FEEDING PRACTICES OF APIS MELLIFERA SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY DEVIATION(S) FROM FORAGING SCHEMATA THROUGH LANDMARK MANIPULATION OR TRANSPOSITION?
Andrea Lynn Lazzari
Melbourne High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of deviations from foraging schemata through landmark manipulation and transposition on the feeding practices of Apis mellifera. If honeybees are dependent on their ability to count landmarks in order to forage effectively, then the manipulation and transposition of such landmarks will not significantly affect their feeding practices. <br><br> <br><br>To analyze the effects of landmark manipulation and transposition, tunnels containing stripes and shapes were placed at the entrances of three Langstroth hives. Watch glasses containing water or a sucrose solution were placed at each of the tunnels’ stripes with the watch glass at the fourth stripe containing the sucrose solution. In Experimental Tunnel One (ET1) the effects of landmark manipulation were assessed by changing the distance between stripes. The effects of landmark transposition were assessed by changing the order of shapes in Experimental Tunnel Two (ET2). Foraging activity was quantified by: 1) calculating the daily change in mass of each watch glass; 2) accounting for the total number of Apis mellifera visiting each watch glass location. <br><br> <br><br>An ANOVA Single-Factor was used to analyze the effects of manipulation and transposition of landmarks on mean mass differences and Apis mellifera counts between experimental and control groups. The results indicated no significant differences in the data collected. Additionally, the F-values suggest that the alternate hypotheses should be rejected. This implies that the feeding practices of Apis mellifera are not as dependent on their counting ability as current research proposes.

NUTRITIONAL RESPONSES: THE EFFECTS OF DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES, LIPIDS, AND PROTEINS ON THE MEMORY AND NEUROMUSCULAR RESPONSES OF PROCAMBARUS CLARKII
Bretton Roy Medlin
Grove High School, Grove, OK

Do carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins have an effect on the escape reflex and memory retention of crayfish? <br><br> It was hypothesized that carbohydrates and proteins would increase escape reflex distances, and increase memory retention. It was also hypothesized that the lipids would have little effect on escape reflex distances and memory retention. <br><br> For escape reflex testing 8 crayfish were used per group. The crayfish were fed a regular diet of commercial food for 8 days and their escape reflex distance was measured after each feeding. To test the escape reflex the crayfish were fed one gram of each concentration of food. After feeding they were placed in a long narrow Plexiglas chamber and prodded to shoot backwards. The distance of this escape reflex is then measured in centimeters. After this, the crayfish were fed for 8 days with the special diets of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and then their escape reflex distance was measured. The crayfish escape reflex distance was measured three times after each feeding. In memory retention testing 7 crayfish were used per group. To test memory retention they are fed the same amounts of food, then placed in a t-shaped Plexiglas chamber. They were then allowed to go either right or left. When crayfish chose left they were shocked in order to persuade to go right. Crayfish were fed a regular diet of commercial food for 8 days, and the amount of times turned right were recorded 10 times before shocking was introduced, then were recorded 30 times after shocking was introduced. Then crayfish were fed a special diet consisting of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins for 8 days, and the amounts turned right were recorded 30 times after each feeding.<br><br> The results of the experiment showed that the protein enriched food caused the greatest increase in the escape reflex distance. The memory retention tests showed decreases in all tests on the percentages of turning right. One thing that was shown in testing is that on average the crayfish gained weight after the consumption of the carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.

BIRDS OF QUAIL HOLLOW RANCH: A STUDY OF AVIAN DIVERSITY
Alexander M. Rinkert
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA

Quail Hollow Ranch County Park, nestled in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, is well-known for its natural diversity. Among the most understudied, however, is the park’s avian life. This project was designed to provide an insight to the birds of the park, as limited information is known and no other documented, scientific study of birds has been performed at this biologically important area. From the 1920’s, Quail Hollow Ranch’s landscape has changed dramatically. Formerly an open grassland surrounded by sand chaparral and sand parkland, mixed evergreen forest and riparian associated habitats have become dominant through secondary succession. As habitats appear and disappear, avian species do as well. This led us to ask “What is the relationship between avian diversity and ecological succession?” We have been birding Quail Hollow Ranch since 2003 and began a formal study in late summer 2009. Through a process of weekly monitoring using point-counts, binoculars, GPS and a weather indicator, we are able to analyze and interpret which species occur in the park, and determine their habitat associations. This will provide a “guide” to the park’s present avifauna, and how it may change as ecological succession proceeds.

THE EFFECTS OF WATER TEMPERATURE AND PH ON THE METABOLIC RATE OF JUVENILE BLUE KING CRABS (PARALITHODES PLATYPUS)
Lia Katherine Domke
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

Increased global CO2 emissions are causing a drop in the ocean’s pH. This could have adverse affects on marine animals, one of which is the blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus). Blue king crabs (BKC) live in Arctic waters and are one of many commercially fished species in Alaska. It would be important to know if BKC and other crabs could be impacted by global climate change. Juvenile BKC were placed in airtight containers at 3 different temperatures (3.7 °C, 5.7°C, and 9.1°C) and 3 different pHs (8.1, 7.62, and 7.08) to determine environmental effects on metabolic rates (MR). Oxygen consumption was measured with an Ocean Optics oxygen probe every thirty minutes for an hour. Crabs in cold water (n=6) had an average MR of 1.4 mlO2/h/g; crabs, in ambient (n=8) water, 1.5 mlO2/hr/g; crabs in warm water (n=8), 2.8 mlO2/hr/g. The data shows no significant difference in MR between water temperatures, (ANOVA p>.05); therefore I accept the null hypothesis. Crabs in the high CO2 (n=7) had an average MR of 3.4 mlO2/hr/g; crabs in low CO2 (n=8), 2.6 mlO2/hr/g; crabs in ambient CO2 (n=8), 1.45 mlO2/hr/g. There was no significant difference between the low and high CO2 a post hoc two-sample t-test determined a significant difference between each pH and ambient pH (p<.05). One important application of this project is determining how increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and subsequent rise in ocean acidity affects animals. According to my data, an increase in ocean acidity increases MR of juvenile blue king crabs.

WHY SPIDERMAN CANNOT DO WITHOUT HIS SILK? EFFECTS OF DRAGLINE SILK ON JUMPING PERFORMANCE OF JUMPING SPIDER (HASARIUS ADANSONI)
Yung-Kang Chen
National Taichung First Senior High School, Taichung City, Taiwan, CHINESE TAIPEI

Spider silk has long been known as a remarkable material with great <br><br>extensibility, strength, and toughness, which are thought to relate to its complex molecular structure and production process. Additionally, spider silk is found to vary with production conditions and its material properties can be controlled by the spiders. To date, most studies on spider silks were based on web-building spiders; however, few studies considered the silks produced by wandering spiders (e.g. jumping spiders), which cannot construct a web. In this study, we examine the jumping behaviors of jumping spiders Hasarius adansoni, and the effects of dragline silk on their jumping performance. Our results suggest that (a) dragline silk is necessary for the spiders to allow them land safely, and (b) jumping spiders can control their postures (e.g. body angles) to maintain its balance in the air. Our analyses show that although air resistance decreases spider’s velocity, the dragline silk also plays a significant role in this process due to the resistant force from the stretched silk (as depicted by Hooke’s Law). Therefore, besides controlling body postures like other jumping animals do, the jumping spiders also use dragline silk to ensure safe landing.

RELAY LANDSCAPE LEARNING: A NEW MODE OF LEARNING IN HONEYBEES, APIS MELLIFERA
Neil Kondamuri
Munster High School, Munster, IN

Relay Landscape Learning: A New Mode of Learning in Honeybees, Apis mellifera<br><br>Abstract<br><br> Honeybees (Apis mellifera) often face the problem of finding their way home from a distant site, potentially as far away as 10 kilometers. Although much is known about the learning capabilities of honeybees, how honeybees locate their home (or hive) in a novel environment is unclear. I asked the question of whether honeybees could perform “relay learning” (increased homing when bees are released close to a previously released site). Indeed, I found this to be true when the relay distance was 0.8 km. When the relay distance was increased to 2 km, the relay effect disappeared. Furthermore, I did not see a significant difference between the vanishing bearings (the direction that bees flew the moment they vanished from view) between the two groups: the relay bees (those that were released near a location from which they had successfully returned home previously) and the control bees. Based on these results, I propose that when bees are released in a novel environment, they search randomly for familiar landscape patterns that would lead them to find their home. The search radius is between 0.5 and 1 km. Understanding landscape learning in honeybees will improve our understanding of the mysterious “colony collapse disorder.”

EFFECT OF RESVERATROL, A PHYTOALEXIN, ON WEIGHT GAIN, LEG LENGTH, AND WING LENGTH OF GALLUS GALLUS CHICKS
Wendell Shane Riels
Seminary High School, Seminary, MS

This experiment explores the possibility of replacing antibiotics and synthetic growth enhancers used on baby Gallus gallus with a phytoalexin that is produced naturally in fruit. This natural compound is resveratrol. If ingestion of resveratrol enhances growth, then introducing chicks to high doses will result in a substantially larger chick. The chicks were seperated into three groups of fifteen chicks: a control, a low dose, and a high dose group. A stock solution was made by diluting 250mg of resveratrol into 20ml of water. Each week for three weeks the low dose group was given 5 ml of stock diluted with their daily 1000ml of water and the high dose was given 10ml of stock diluted with 1000ml of water. All groups were given the same amount of feed each day. At the end of each week, the chick's individual weights and measurements were documented. The H group showed a larger weight gain and a longer leg length compared to the control chicks; however, the wing length was actually shorter. The weight increase of the H group proved that resveratrol does have a positive effect on the growth rate and these results suggest that resveratrol may produce a stockier and more compact bird, which could benefit the poultry industry. This experiment proved that it is possible to replace commonly used antibiotics with resveratrol and achieve positive results. Although the results look promising, more testing should be done to determine the long-term benefits and potential adverse effects of using resveratrol.

IRON CONCENTRATION OF QUAGGA MUSSEL GLUE AND ITS EFFECT ON SHIPWRECKS
Amanda Grace Savagian
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School, Milwaukee, WI

Quagga mussels entered the Great Lakes in 1988, and have since spread prolifically through the freshwater system, altering ecosystems, food webs, and lake compositions. In addition to their impact on natural environments, they have also adhered to numerous historic shipwrecks within Lake Michigan, covering the wrecks entirely. A concern for their preservation led me to examine the possible effects quagga mussels may have on submerged wooden wrecks, and to explore the possible reasons for these effects; one reason would be the presence of iron, which discolors wood, in quagga glue. I tested the effect of quagga glue on oak and beech by allowing them to adhere for 8 weeks, and then observed the woods’ conditions. Neither oak nor beech were discolored or otherwise altered, and thus quagga mussels do not impact submerged wood during a short period of time. <br><br>Quagga mussels were placed in various substrate treatments (PVC, aluminum, painted aluminum, brass, steel, steel with POR-15, copper, fiberglass, glass, and rocks) to determine the source of iron in quagga mussel threads. Is iron accumulated in the thread after it has attached, or is it accumulated from iron filtered from the surrounding water? Samples of threads attached to the beakers, threads attached to substrates, threads attached to mussels, bodies, and shells from different treatments were run through a spectrophotometer to determine iron concentration. The concentrations showed that iron is both accumulated from the substrate and filtered through the water; I also produced a reliable iron budget for quagga mussels.

EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE FEEDING TIMES ON HAMSTERS
Hagan Maree Capnerhurst
Batesburg-Leesville High School, Batesburg-Leesville, SC

My purpose in performing this experiment was to determine if hamsters would be effected by a change of feeding times; not being fed for one night, yet being fed the following day. I wanted to learn if Robo Hamsters would keep on the same routine of eating less during the day than at night, or if they would break habit, and make up for the night they did not receive food by eating more during the following day. I predicted that if Robo Hamsters are not given food at night, they will continue their usual routine, eating less during the the next day than on a regular night. In my experiment, I gave each hamster food during a night and a day and measured how much was removed from the bowl for both night and day. This was my control group. I then removed the food for one night, then replaced the food the following day and measured how much food was removed from the bowl for that day. Based on my results, my hypothesis was correct. On average, the hamsters continued to consume less during the day after the night the food was removed than on a normal night. <br><br>

DOES SIZE MATTER? A STUDY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND CELLULAR HYDRATION
Nathan Lyne Frantz
Fleming High School, Fleming, CO

The purpose of the project “Does Size Matter” was to look at the effects of dietary supplements on cell hydration. The effects of these supplements was be measured by measuring pictures of muscle fiber obtained from crayfish.<br><br>Crayfish were purchased and banded and allowed to acclimate in their new surroundings. Crayfish food was then treated with different dietary supplements. These supplements included Creatine, Electrolytes, and Amino Acids. Muscle fibers were placed on microscope slides and pictures were taken using a digital camera. Muscle fiber size was then measured. <br><br>As the period of ingestion and digestion of the dietary supplements continued, the size of the cells increased. The Creatine plus Electrolyte group showed the most overall growth, with a 383% growth. The control group showed the least amount of growth with a 160% growth. All of the treatment groups showed a significant amount of growth compared to the control group.<br><br>This data can be applied in the real world to help increase the overall amount of protein available. With a growing demand for protein in the world, this data shows there is a cost effective way to produce more protein, without having to purchase more animals. Creatine supplementation can be very costly however. A combination of Amino Acids and Electrolytes showed almost the exact same growth as the Creatine by itself. These two things are inexpensive when compared to Creatine. This is a cost effective way to increase overall amount of protein available for a growing world population.

LYSINE AND METHIONINE REQUIREMENTS OF CHICKS FED LOW PROTEIN CORN-SOYBEAN MEAL DIETS: A THREE YEAR STUDY
Rosemary Frances Chapple
Waterloo High School, Waterloo, IL

In recent years the cost of soybean meal and other commodities typically used in commercial broiler diets has escalated. Conversely, synthetic amino acid prices have been relatively stable. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the amount of synthetic lysine and methionine supplementation required for low protein diets to maximize chick growth and efficiency. Eight diets were each fed to four replicate pens of chicks from day 7 to 21 post-hatch. Two replicates contained one chick per pen and two replicates contained two chicks per pen. A basal, 20% protein corn-soybean meal diet was formulated which provided lysine and methionine plus cystine at approximately 90% and 70% of NRC suggested levels, respectively. Lysine (0.30%) and methionine (0.372%) were added to the basal diet to create a summit diet containing 110% of NRC levels. Intermediate, equally spaced dietary levels were achieved for each amino acid in two additional diets by appropriate supplementation while supplying a surplus of the other amino acid (110%). A 23% protein diet served as the positive control treatment. Lysine requirements estimated from ADG and F/G data were 1.19% and 1.25%, respectively. These were similar to that suggested by the NRC (1.20%). The same criteria resulted in methionine plus cystine requirement estimates of 0.89% and 0.90%, both of which were slightly less than the 0.93% NRC suggested level. Methionine was confirmed to be the first limiting amino acid in the 20% protein basal diet. However, lysine was apparently used more efficiently than methionine for growth. Chicks with heavier initial body weights and grown one bird per pen grew faster, but less efficiently.

EFFECTS OF STARVATION ON WILD TYPE AND ADIPOSE60 MUTANT DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Alyssa Chelsea Ehrlich
South Side High School, Rockville Centre, NY

Obesity, an abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that presents a significant risk to health, has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Studying genes that influence adipogenesis is a promising alternative approach to addressing the public health crisis presented by obesity. Mutation of the adipose gene, an evolutionarily conserved gene that controls triglyceride storage, causes obesity in Drosophila melanogaster. Compared to wild type flies, adipose60 mutants have increased longevity under starvation conditions. In this experimental study, various effects of 24-hour starvation on wild type and adipose60 mutant flies were compared. To starve flies by allowing them access to water but not nutrients, flies were transferred to an agar medium. To test locomotion, walking speeds of individual flies were measured. A manometric microrespirometer was constructed to measure oxygen consumption in order to observe changes in metabolic rate. Triglyceride content was quantified using the Infinity Triglycerides Reagent; glycogen content was quantified using the Pointe Scientific Glucose Oxidase Reagent. The results of the glycogen assay disagreed with those of prior experiments. The effect of starvation on glycogen content was nearly identical for both fly strains. Starvation decreased walking speed for wild type flies and increased walking speed for mutant flies. In wild type flies, starvation elevated metabolic rate; in mutant flies, starvation lowered metabolic rate. Starvation depleted triglyceride stores in wild type flies more radically than in mutant flies. Thus adipose60 flies appear to be starvation resistant due to a combination of increased energy storage and decreased rate of energy expenditure in response to starvation.

COMPARISON OF CANINE LYME DISEASE BETWEEN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND
Shahleen Zehra Ahmed
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

Human Lyme is difficult to track, but dogs are sentinels for disease and present Lyme similarly. This study used Canine Lyme to discover high exposure areas and specific factors that cause Lyme in Virginia and Maryland.<br><br> I originally hypothesized that the rural counties (under 360 ppl/mi2) of Maryland would have higher exposure to Lyme than rural counties of Virginia. 2,517 samples from 22 counties were collected from June 2007—June 2009. The Chi squares tabulated from the Mini tab program indicated population density, county, and region as strong factors that influence Canine Lyme in both states (P=0.000). However, rural areas in Virginia actually had more Lyme exposure than rural areas in Maryland (St Resid = 1.77 vs 0.34). But there were twice as many rural counties in Virginia, which might have caused bias. In Virginia, suburban counties (361—1200 ppl/mi2), the Northern Virginia Region, and the counties of Winchester, Prince William, and Loudon are most exposed to Lyme Disease based off of their standardized residual values(St Resid = 3.35, St Resid = 3.47, St Resid= 6.22, St Resid =5.70 St Resid = 5.56). Maryland collectively had more urban counties exposed to Lyme (St Resid = 3.55), but individually, the rural Southern Region and Charles County were most exposed (St Resid = 9.21). Socioeconomic status was insignificant in Virginia, but significant in Maryland (P=0.014 vs P= 0.000), especially the high income counties of Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Howard, Charles, and Wicomico. <br><br> In the end, the data did not support my hypothesis since rural counties in Virginia had more Lyme than in Maryland. However, the study fulfilled its objectives. Thus, the lack of a definitive Canine Lyme database and weak human surveillance systems merits further research in this field.

THE EFFECTS OF GENOTYPIC PHEROMONES ON INBREEDING OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Rio Anthony McMahon
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek, NV

In my project, I set out to inbreed Drosophila melanogaster. After comprehensive research, I discovered that it would be possible to “trick” them into inbreeding. The way that this is possible is through introducing pheromones of a different genotype then that of the flies being inbred. This all had to be done while isolating flies in containment area, making sure that they were of the same genotype.<br><br> The way I achieved this was by creating an “Inbreeding chamber.” The way that this is done is done is by connecting two tubes with a light sponge stopper in between them. On one side of the divider was a general population of flies – Flies of different genotypes breeding normally. On the other side there was the inbred population – Flies of the same genotype, which were “tricked” into inbreeding.<br><br> The way this contraption works, is it uses the pheromones that flies release normally in the mating cycle. When the male courts a female, he releases a pheromone, which the female can smell and decipher how genetically close she is to the male, naturally helping prevent inbreeding. When the general population breeds normally, the pheromones travel with the ambient airflow through the sponge (which serves as a barrier for both populations, and contains the inbred population to that of the same genotype), it “tricks” the female into accepting the males courtship, even though they are off the same genotype.<br><br> In the end, my procedure worked, and I successfully inbred 4 generations. I found multiple mutations, mostly including some sort of pigmentation differentiation. I also found three flies with major mutations which I named mutants. These specimens showed major pigmentation differentiations, as well as an altered abdominal shape.

QUANTIFYING THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF JUVENILE ATLANTIC STURGEON IN THE HUDSON RIVER
Sean Patrick Maiorano
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Past studies have shown a significant decline of the Atlantic (Acipenser oxyrhynchus) and shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) populations throughout the eastern seaboard; specifically in the Hudson River. This longitudinal study was the first of its kind to monitor the Atlantic sturgeon population in the Hudson River since the closure of the commercial fishery in 1996. Relative abundance sampling for sturgeon took place in Haverstraw Bay in the Hudson River, (River Kilometer 58- 66) using anchored gill nets. During March and April of each season in which this longitudinal study took place, Atlantic (2009 CPUE .295, 2008 CPUE .082) and shortnose (2009 CPUE .085, 2008 CPUE .056) sturgeon catch per unit effort (CPUE) improved suggesting potential population increases of both species. It was determined that distance to the salt front had the greatest impact on the CPUE The juvenile Atlantic sturgeon were caught more frequently when we sampled below the salt front, in conditions with a higher salinity. The shortnose sturgeon show nearly an opposite preference regarding the salt front, found more frequently when sampling occurred above the salt front in water which has a lower salinity. These first two years of data are important as indices for future years and will help to determine the change in population and the continued effect of salinity of sturgeon CPUE.

CAN HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE ON EGGS CAUSE STERILITY IN ALL TROUT SPECIES?
Tylynn Marie Barker
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Can Hydrostatic Pressure on eggs cause sterility in all trout species? Trout produced at local hatcheries pose a threat to Native Cutthroat Trout in the Western States. This project will help protect native trout species. Applying enough pressure after fertilization on the egg causes the spindles that connect the two sets of chromosomes inside the egg to break resulting in a triploid zygote. Rainbow eggs were held at 10,000 psi for 5 minutes, Brown eggs were held at 10,000 psi for 6 minutes, and Brook eggs were held at 10,000 psi for 7 min. The length of time varied under pressure depending on how fast or slow each species developed as an embryo. The eggs were then placed in an incubator till they hatched. When the fish grew to about 2 inches long, a blood sample was taken. I observed that the red blood cells of each pressure induced species were larger than the control group. Research has shown that the triploid red blood cells would be larger and have a rippled appearance. To confirm that the fish were indeed triploid, blood samples were sent to an independent lab for confirmation. There are substantial benefits that will result from the project. First, as more sterile trout are produced at local, hatcheries, these fish can be stocked in lakes and streams without threatening the gene pool or habitat of Native Cutthroat Trout. Secondly, this technology can be used to help control aquatic invasive species such as Zebra and Quagga Mussels.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF A HOMOLOG OF THE EXTRA CELLULAR MATIX PROTEIN, HLAMP-1 IN 24 HOUR- 72 HOUR ZEBRAFISH EMBRYO
Ambria Nicole McDonald
William B. Murrah High School, Jackson, MS

The partitioning of the heart into its four chambers is initiated by the formation of cardiac mesenchyme within the confines of the atrioventricular canal and proximal outflow tract. The cardiac extracellular matrix protein hLAMP-1 is part of a multi-component complex that initiates the transformation of endothelium into mesenchyme within the atrioventricular canal and proximal outflow tract of the heart. <br><br> Data from my laboratory suggests that a 280 kDa member of this complex named hLAMP-1 may function as the inducing molecule and is also present in other areas of the embryo undergoing epithelial/mesenchymal transformation, suggesting that this molecule is an important player in this type of interaction throughout the embryo. If confirmed in later studies, this protein, if non-existent or coded for incorrectly, may cause problems in heart development for adults. It may also lead to known heart defects.<br><br> A chicken sequence that codes for hLAMP-1 has been identified and is used as the control for this project. In order to confirm the presence of hLAMP-1 in 24hr-72 hr zebrafish embryo, I analyzed data from RNA Isolation, RT PCR, In Situ Hybridization, and a DNA Sequence. I report here the identification of an approximate 400 base pair clone that was homologous to the chick sequence. The In Situ whole mounts as well correspond to the existence of hLAMP-1 in the zebrafish’s heart with similar staining to that of the chick. Currently, my lab is looking into other animals to further the research and identification of hLAMP- 1, which will, if identified, provide insight into transgenic animals with known heart defects and they too will be screened for the expression of hLAMP-1.

MY SPACE! A STUDY OF GAUSE'S LAW OF COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION WITH UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY CRAYFISH
Vincent Jacob O'Leary

When major fish populations start to disappear and fishermen lose their jobs, who's to blame? Fishermen? Pollution? Global warming? All good guesses, but no. One major reason could be crayfish! That’s right, the humble crayfish, specifically the invasive species Orconectes procericambarus rusticus,(the rusty crayfish) has the potential to wipe out many fish populations. By invading other bodies of water, O. rusticus can cause a decline in not only the crayfish population, but the fish and plant life too. In some cases, O. rusticus is one of the only organisms left after it invades! This project was a study of behavioral patterns of O. rusticus and Orconectes crockerinus obscurus (the Allegheny crayfish) when competing for shelter. These behavioral patterns were observed through competition for a single shelter. Variables were reduced by keeping the light levels constant, using size equivalent crayfish, controlling the sex and species of the crayfish used, and taping the 60 trials to avoid influencing the crayfish behaviors by observing them during the trial. A resident crayfish was repeatedly exposed to an invader crayfish in fifteen minute bouts for shelter. Data gathered from these trials suggests that O. rusticus is able to guard its shelter more effectively than O. obscurus (P<0.005), a behavioral pattern that would aid in its ability to invade effectively and efficiently. It is hoped that by doing this project it will lead to a better understanding of how O. rusticus invades, and lead to the development of practical ways to control this invasive species.

LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT NATURALITY AS A VARYING FACTOR IN THE STRESS LEVELS AND SCIENTIFIC VIABILITY OF THE SWISS LABORATORY MOUSE
Casey J Acklin
The Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

The experiment attempted to decrease stress levels of laboratory mice by enriching their cages and/or designing cages that mimicked their natural environment. The driving principle was that, since studies have shown enrichment is beneficial, a natural setting might allow for more natural behaviors, therefore increasing scientific viability. Using the Swiss strain of mouse, stress levels were measured using competitive fecal corticosterone ELISA assays. In addition, behavioral observations and litter weights were recorded. Procedurally, mice were mated, three females to one male, in three types of cages, -- standard, enriched, and natural. At three weeks old, pups were weaned. Feces was collected as follows: From the females and males (combined) pre- and post-mating; from females pre- and post-birth, and pre- and post-weaning; and from pups (combined) pre-weaning and post-weaning (males and females separately). Fecal collections and litter weights were taken three times per week, for three weeks post-weaning. Observations were recorded daily. The only timepoint for which enrichment made a significant difference in stress was in pre-birth, where mothers in natural cages had much less stress than mothers in standard cages. This shows that natural cages produce more scientifically viable mice, as stress in prenatal mothers can lead to problems in bodily functions of pups. Litter weights showed that, on average, pups in natural cages had higher weights and greater weight gain rates than the others, demonstrating that a natural cage is healthier, as higher weaning weights lead to a decreased chance of obesity later in life.

A BUG'S LIGHT: INSECT PREDILECTION TO LIGHT COLOR, PHASE IV
Daniel Seguro Samora
Alamogordo Senior High School, Alamogordo, NM

The purpose of this project is to determine if temperature is a factor of insects’ preference to light color. Is it possible to use temperature along with light to further study and manage insects? <br><br> I obtained eight different colors of light bulbs. I built a light fixture out of wood, electric cords, and light bulb sockets. I hung the light fixture outside and turned on the lights at the same time every night. I recorded the temperature. At 30-minute intervals for 1 hour, I recorded my data until I had sufficient temperature data to make a comparison. <br><br> As the temperature changes, so does the insects’ light color preference. As the temperature increased the reveal, clear, softwhite, pink, green, and blue lights attracted more insects. The softwhite had the most at 60 and 70 degrees, then surprisingly as the temperature increased the softwhite attracted fewer insects. By the time the temperature reached the 90s, the only lights that had insects were the reveal and clear. <br><br> I learned that certain light colors determine an insect’s preference, and which color of light will attract which kind of insect, and also temperature is a determining factor. More importantly, I learned that the two most common vector insects were attracted to only one light color at certain temperatures. By examining light color, along with temperature, scientists can study and manage insect behavior and learn new ways to control vector insects in lighted areas.<br><br> Further tests could include testing the lights in a controlled temperature setting.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT GENERA OF ALGAE ON THE PHOSPHORUS EXCRETION AND OXYGEN DEPLETION OF QUAGGA MUSSELS (DREISSENA BUGENSIS)
Christopher Linabury Welker
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Abstract<br><br>The purpose of this study was to help scientists find out about the highly invasive, nuisance Quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) by investigating its diet in a controlled laboratory environment, which has not been done before. It was predicted, based on observations in their natural environment, that Quagga mussels would eat more of certain genera of alga, Selenastrum, Cyclotella and Peridinium than of the cyanobacterium, Gleocapsa. Consumption of algae by Quagga mussels requires the utilization of oxygen and results in the excretion of phosphorous. Therefore, two separate measures of consumption were used as dependent variables in this experiment: (1) SRP (Soluble Reactive Phosphorus) samples, and (2) dissolved oxygen samples. The independent variables were the four different genera of algae. The experiment took place in a controlled environment with a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, in 20 liter tanks, with equal numbers of Quagga mussels per tank, constant light conditions, and equivalent concentrations of algae per tank. Two significant differences in the SRP category were found by using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple t - Tests. These results showed that the consumption of Selenastrum and Peridinium was greater than that of Gleocapsa. There were no statistically significant differences in the measures of dissolved oxygen. Based on the measures of SRP, the experimental hypothesis was correct. Gleocapsa was the least consumed algae; this is thought to have happened because Gleocapsa has been found to be poisonous to Quagga mussels. Selenastrum and Peridinium were the most ingested; they are both nutritious for Quagga mussels. If this experiment were to be repeated, it is recommended that the sample size be increased and that temperature and depth of water be varied. It is possible there were no differences in the measures of dissolved oxygen because the Quagga mussels had been separated from their sources of algae for two hours because the SRP testing occurred first. This may be too long to wait to measure dissolved oxygen. Next time the Quagga mussels could be reintroduced to the algae and the dissolved oxygen testing could be performed immediately.

AN EVALUATION OF INVASIVE TUNICATES IN PLEASANT HARBOR, WASHINGTON
Marley Elizabeth Iredale
Sequim High School, Sequim, WA

Invasive tunicate populations are found in portions of Puget Sound and the Hood Canal in Washington State. These invasive tunicates are negatively impacting shellfish stocks and are fouling surfaces of man made structures and in the marine environment. Three non-native tunicate species are of primary concern: Styela clava, Ciona sacignyi, and Didemnum sp. The purpose of this research was multifaceted: appraise tunicate populations at Pleasant Harbor Marina in the Hood Canal; determine the ratio of native to invasive tunicates; assess the spread of invasive tunicates within the marina; and evaluate eradication methods for invasive tunicates.<br><br>In order to accurately determine tunicate populations, I conducted an underwater survey using scuba gear. I constructed a camera mount to set a study frame and hold the underwater camera. Photographs were taken at various slips at three different docks to perform my study. I then analyzed these photographs using a computer to determine the number of native-solitary, native-colonial, invasive-solitary, and invasive-colonial tunicates present. A marine aquarium was prepared to maintain populations of tunicates and four methods of eradication were tested. Electric shock treatments and lowered seawater pH were the most effective, while tunic enzyme treatment was effective on young tunicates and freshwater submersion had no effect on tunicate populations. It may be feasible for marinas to utilize combinations of these methods to control invasive tunicate populations.

THE INFLUENCE OF ANTIPARASITICS ON PARASITE BURDEN AND IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VIRAL VACCINATION
Nathan Sven Wilen
Belle Fourche High School, Belle Fourche, SD

Due to the lack of new or emerging antiparasitics, this research may encourage changes in the use of antiparasitics that will allow for longer product lifetimes. Longer product lifetimes will soon be necessary to control the bovine parasite population if new products do not emerge and parasites continue to become more resistant to current antiparasitics. This study involved 470 heifers with each heifer receiving one of three antiparasitics, fenbendazole, ivermectin, or doramectin. A viral vaccination was administered and pre-treatment blood and fecal samples were taken on Study Days 0 and 1. Post-treatment blood and fecal samples were taken and the parasite burden was evaluated using the fecal-egg count reduction test. Serum-neutralizing (SN) titers were completed at a diagnostic laboratory for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) Types 1 and 2. The data showed parasite reductions of 99.3%, 86.3%, and 95.6% for fenbendazole, ivermectin, and doramectin, respectively (P<0.015). For BVDV Type 1 the SN titers showed fold improvements of antibody production of 7.6, 6.3, and 6.5, for fenbendazole, doramectin, and ivermectin, respectively (P<0.16). Type 2 titers showed fold improvements of 19.5, 14.4, and 38.4 for fenbendazole, doramectin, and ivermectin, respectively (P<0.06). Overall, the data taken from the fecal egg count reduction test indicates that fenbendazole had the greatest treatment effect, measured by parasite reduction, with doramectin and ivermectin following in decreasing order. The data also indicates that, numerically, fenbendazole had the greatest fold increase in antibody production for BVDV Type 1, but that ivermectin had the greatest fold increase for Type 2.

THE EFFECTS OF FOOD DEPRIVATION IN AGONISTIC CONTESTS BETWEEN MALE JUVENILE HOUSE CRICKETS, ACHETA DOMESTICUS
Robert Keith Pak
Valley High School, West Des Moines, IA

The persistence of disadvantaged individuals in a population to remain suggests that some factor(s) permit them to overcome others of greater resource holding power. The purpose of the project was to determine the effects of fasting in agonistic contests between male juvenile house crickets on the smaller cricket. Fasting was used to create a desire for the resource: food. <br><br>Food was withdrawn from the smaller cricket at 0 hr (control), 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr. Agonistic contests between small male crickets (1.3 ± .07 cm) and large male cricket (1.9 ±.08 cm) were assessed: duration timed with a stopwatch; conflict level measured using a modified Hoffman and Schildberger scale; and winner determined by the retreating cricket. <br><br>Fasting has statistically shown to affect performance, duration of fight, and conflict level. The proportion of wins tended to increase the longer the crickets were fasted, with the crickets fasting 24 hours significantly differing from the control (z-test with Yate’s correction; p=0.036). Fasting affected the duration of the fights (one-way ANOVA, p=<0.001), having the most impact on the group of crickets that fasted 24 and 48 hours (Holm-Sidak’s Method multiple comparison; Critical Level .013 and .017). Fasting affected the conflict level of the fights (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA; P=0.037), having the most impact on the group of crickets that fasted 12 hours (Dunn’s Method multiple comparison; Q=2.540; P<0.05).<br><br>The study shows that relative resource holding power, size, can be overcome by motivation in the form of fasting.

ETHOLOGY OF FRIENDSHIP AMONG ADULT MALE BONNET MACAQUES (MACACA RADIATA) AT ARUNACHALA HILL, INDIA
Athman Ramana Adiseshan
Ramana Academy, San Jose, CA

Social scientists define “friendship” as care for the well being of another without expecting immediate repayment. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adult male bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) express friendship in their natural setting at the foothills of Arunachala Hill in Southern India by asking the following questions: Do adult male bonnet macaque dyads enjoy social relationships? Do the strength of social relationships vary among dyads? Is there a time-matched reciprocity in social relationships among dyads? If such reciprocity exists, is the level of reciprocity within a bout of grooming, within a short span of time, or within the entire sampling period? Does a correlation exist between the strength of social relationships and dominance ranks among adult males?<br><br>Focal sampling over 150 hours was conducted to record data on agonistic and affiliative behavior of the seven adult males in the study group. Agonistic behavior data were used to construct a dominance hierarchy. Affiliative behaviors between a dyad included grooming and sitting in proximity. Within each focal sample, durations of such behaviors of the focal male were recorded.<br><br>Results show that the adult male bonnet macaques have social relationships of varying strengths with other males in the group. There was a negative correlation between dominance ranking distance and strength of social relationships within dyads. There was little reciprocity of grooming within a bout of grooming, or within a short span, but higher reciprocity over the sampling period. In conclusion, the male bonnet macaques did not indulge in immediate tit-for-tat reciprocal altruism, but overall reciprocity was exhibited as strong social bonds. Thus, adult male bonnet macaques expressed friendship.

THE ACQUAINTANCE AND STUDY OF ENDANGERED INSECTS IN THE TIRANA DISTRICT STRICTLY FOR PROTECTION PURPOSES
Kristi Mitre
Gjimnazi Ismail Qemali, Tirane, ALBANIA

Today, all-around the world, exist approximately 1600 species of plants and animals classified as endangered, 728 from which are currently part of habitats here in Albania (532 of them are animals). The plan of action for biodiversity conservation and endangered species protection was signed by 190 states. In Albania are actually counted 84 mammals, 15 amphibians, 313 fishes and around 3850 insects.<br><br>The project is focused into the recognition of some of the endangered species in Tirana district. The information regarding the insects living in this area was retrieved from the Red Book. In continuation we have broaden our knowledge about some species by getting to know better their natural habitats and observing parts of their life cycle and as a result we have compiled a series of measures necessary to protect these species. <br><br>The project has consisted in visits in specific areas in Tirana district, the most important of them being Dajti Mountain, Vora, etc. Initially I created a group of people called ‘Fauna experts’. With their help,I have observed some of the endangered species in their natural habitats. In continuation it has been checked if these species are under the strict measures of conservation as appointed by IUCN. Simultaneously it was prepared a draft with a number of conclusions deriving from our work ready for delivering to the APCNEA. <br><br>The contributions of this project are three folded. First, it was made possible the recognition of endangered species in Tirana district. The study was the first one of its kind in 8 years in Tirana. Second, we learned more about natural habitats which host these species and pictures of them were taken. Finally a list of steps necessary in the the recognition and protection of these species and their habitats was created.

THE EFFECT OF PESTICIDES ON THE CHEMOTAXIS OF PLANARIA
Christina yah-yun Lee
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

Planaria are flat worms that have sensitive chemoreceptors. With such sensitive chemoreceptors this organism can serve as a sensitive marker of chemical impact on environment ecology. The pesticides used in the experiment are Bifenthrin, Lamda-cyhalothrin, and Carbaryl are pesticides which affect pests by over stimulating their nervous system and 2,4-D is a herbicide known to be highly toxic to fish. The experiment was performed with 1/6000 dilutions of the pesticides in trays with food 18 cm away from a planaria, and then the rate of chemotaxis was measured in seconds.<br><br>The hypothesis is, “If the planaria are exposed to pesticides then the rate of chemotaxis will be decreased.” This is because all of the tested chemicals are known to be neurotoxic to fish and insects.<br><br>The results were three of the four chemicals decreased chemotaxis, while the 2,4-D did not. The results supported the hypothesis, except for the 2,4-D. This may be because it is an herbicide and in some forms it is not toxic to Daphnia. My results prove that the common store brand insecticides store could be dangerous to aquatic life.

THE LIFE OF A PLANARIA
Betlihem Dilnessa Ayalew
Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, DC

The purpose of this experiment was to understand how the regeneration rate of planarian is affected when exposed to various magnetic fields. This is very important due to the strong correlations it has to human stem cell research. The cells of the planarian share all the common characteristics with totipotent stem cells; in their ability to transform into any tissue in the body. It was hypothesized that exposing a planarian to higher magnetic fields would accelerate the regeneration rate. Each planarian was cut horizontally 3mm from the head and three planarians were placed in each test tube with spring water. With the exception of the control group, a neodymium magnet was placed underneath each test tube at various distances to create multiple different magnetic fields. Test tube #1 was a distance of 0cm (from the top of magnet), test tube #2 was 5cm, test tube was 10cm, test tube #4 was 15cm and lastly test tube #5 was 20cm.<br><br>The regeneration rate of the planarian increased or decreased depending on the intensity, orientation, and duration of the magnetic field. The epimorphosis regeneration involved the cellular perforation at the site of the wound, which in return enabled the planarian to produce posterior organs. However, the strength of the magnetic field created by neodymium magnets halted some of the planarians from producing missing components. This study concluded that higher strengths of neodymium magnetic fields can decrease the rate of regeneration of a planarian.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND THE POST METAMORPHIC GROWTH OF LYTECHINUS VARIEGATUS
Charnelle Kanisha Bland
Maritime and Science Technology Academy, Miami, FL

This experiment called for two studies in order to find the effects that ocean acidification will have on Lytechinus variegatus, while having an optimal food regimen. The sea urchins were held in a hatchery density of 10 sea urchins per cage. The type of diets that were used to determine which set of L. variegatus would have a higher growth rate were Ulva sp., Agardhiella subulata, Gracilaria ferox, and a mixture of the three. The ad libitum food intake which had the highest results was the mixed diet, with an absolute growth rate percentage of 26, 470 mg, over a 57-day trial period. However, after using a Tukey and ANOVA test, the test results proved that the Ulva sp. diet did not have a significant statistical difference with the mixed diet. Therefore, it was used in the second study. In the second study, there are three different CO2 levels being measured: 800 ppm, 560 ppm, and 380 ppm. The 380 ppm is the ambient CO2 level in the ocean. The diameter of the sea urchins’ test and the weight of the animals were examined in relation to the growth rate and the effects of increased carbon dioxide levels over a 68-day trial period. The results suggest that a decreased pH level causes a detrimental effect on the post metamorphic stage of Lytechinus variegatus. Due to sea urchins being marine invertebrates, the increased levels of carbon dioxide can have a harmful effect on other marine organisms and its habitats as well.

THE EFFECT OF GENETIC MUTATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER IN FOOD ODOR PREFERENCE
Katherine Marie Neal
Beaufort Academy, Beaufort, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of genetic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster in food odor preference. The hypothesis was that mutation would affect the odor preference in the fruit fly, each mutation differently. One must order four different mutated flies, each with a mutation on different chromosomes, along wild type flies. Each vial contains 100 flies, which allows a general percentage to be made.<br><br> The constant variables include: temperature, exposure to sunlight, ripeness and temperature of the fruit, amount of time for the flies to travel between vials and the wild type flies (used to compare.) The independent variable is the mutations occurring in the fly (ebony, white-eye, eyeless, and dumpy.) The dependent variable is how many flies end up in each fruit vial.<br><br> While the flies are unconscious, the tubes connecting to the fruit vials are inserted into the main fly vial. The tubes are secured, and the timer starts when the majority regains consciousness. After repeating the experiment four times with each fly type, the hypothesis was correct. <br><br> Mutation did affect the odor preferences, but results were not as evident as predicted. The ebony flies (chromosome 3 mutation) had odor preferences most similar to the wild type, while the white-eye flies (chromosome 1 mutations) had results least like the wild type. The eyeless (chromosome 4 mutations) and dumpy (chromosome 2 mutations) flies had fluctuating results, but the average for eyeless showed that they had preferences closer to the wild type than the dumpy flies.

Phytoplanktons have been major, essential sources for some types of scombers (Rastrelliger neglectus). To have a sufficient number of scombers consumption for Thai people throughout the country, we need to locate the places having scombers’ plentiful food. As a result, the purpose of this research project was to study the compatibility of the phytoplanktons found in the Maerumpueng Peat Swamp forest, the Maerumpueng canal, the Maerumpueng Bay and those found in the alimentary canal of scomber babies. This study used scombers babies with the length about 10 cm. The phytoplankton samples, derived from 5 sampling stations, were collected, using a plankton net of 85-µm mesh in size in the rainy season of May-August 2009 and the summer of 2010. The study revealed 52 genera of phytoplanktons under 3 divisions: Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Chromophyta. The genera found in alimentary canal of scombers included Bacteriastrum, Protoperinidium, Paralia, Pleurosigma, Climacosphenia, Thalassionema, Thalassiosira, Actioncyclus, Ceratium, Coscinodiscus, Arachnoiddiscus, Asteroplalus, Chaetoceros, Dinophysis, Navicula, Pseudo-nitzschia, Pseudosolenia, Protoperinidium, Pinnularia, Roperia and Planktonella. Among those genera found in the alimentary canal of the scombers, only Chaetoceros was found in all sampling stations. In addition, Bacteriastrum, Coscinodiscus, Navicula, Pseudo-nitzschia, Pseudosolenia, Protoperinidium and Thalassionema were found only in the canal and the bay. The findings suggest that the Maerumpueng Peat Swamp forest, Maerumpueng canal and Maerumpueng bay may be rich sources of phytoplanktons which are the main food of scomber babies living in the Maerumpueng Bay, Prachuab Khiri Khan, Thailand.

THE NERVOUS FUNCTION OF AURELIA AURITA (MOON JELLYFISH) AND ITS RELATION TO DISCRIMINATION OF CERTAIN SHAPES AND COLORS
Adolfo Rodriguez-Velazquez
Florencia Garcia High School, Las Piedras, PUERTO RICO

In past studies, the researcher concluded that Aurelia aurita has the ability to discriminate certain shapes and colors. This research proposed to study Aurelia aurita’s nervous system to verify if it is related with such discrimination. The problem was: "Is there a relationship between neural functions of Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) and its capacity for discrimination of specific colors and shapes?” “The hypothesis was: “The nervous system of Aurelia aurita is related to its discrimination of certain shapes and colors.” <br><br> A water tank was built to put the jellyfish. It was divided into three different sections that were covered with white, black and green plastics. The sections were divided into three sub-sections each in which there were obstacles placed vertically and horizontally. Twenty-five jellyfishes were captured and freed inside the water tank. The jellyfishes were observed eight times daily during fifteen days, four observations during the day and four during night. It was observed that through a coordinated swim and using the border of its mesoglea jellyfishes evaded the objects placed as obstacles in the water tank. The rhopalium is a structure found at certain spots in the border of the mesoglea. Based on the behavior of the jellyfishes the researcher related the rhopalium with the function of discriminating shapes and colors and also with evading the obstacles. The dissection of three preserved jellyfishes evidenced that the rhopalium was well developed in this species. The hypothesis proved to be true because the ropallium is part of the jellyfish nervous system.

ESTIMATING TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER POPULATIONS IN AGRICULTURE AREAS USING MARK AND RECAPTURE TECHNIQUES
Nathaniel Wade Hubbs
Camden Central High School, Camden, TN

Cattle grazing results in significant impacts to ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cattle grazing would have adverse impacts on terrestrial salamander populations. Impacts from cattle grazing were studied by monitoring salamanders in grazed and ungrazed areas. Two methods, counts and mark and recapture, were used to estimate the terrestrial salamander populations in the study areas. The methods were compared to determine the most effective method for estimating salamander populations. Artificial cover boards were used for population monitoring. Ten artificial cover board stations were established along each of two, 200-meter transects per study area. Counts were conducted bimonthly during the fall season (September to November). Captured salamanders were measured (snout to vent length) and marked by capture area with a Visible Implant Fluorescent Elastomer (VIE) tagging system developed by Northwest Marine Technology Inc. Recaptures were noted on field sheets, measured and released. The Schnabel Method was used to calculate population estimates from the mark-recapture data. Based on the mark-recapture data, the No Cattle Study Area contained about 15 percent more salamanders than the Cattle Study Area while the bimonthly counts showed that the salamander population for the No Cattle Study Area was approximately 36 percent higher than the Cattle Study Area. Both population estimates showed the No Cattle Study Area had a higher percentage of salamanders than the Cattle Study Area. Therefore, the hypothesis was supported and cattle did have an adverse impact on the salamander population.

USE OF REGRESSION ANALYSES TO BUILD ECOLOGICAL MODELS OF POISON DART FROGS IN THEIR NATIVE HABITATS
Gabriel Thailand Joachim
Cibola High School, Albuquerque, NM

All over the world frogs are dying off at an alarming rate due to pollution, global warming, deforestation, Chytrid fungus, and habitat destruction. Any conservation efforts must take into account ecological variables important to frog survival. The purpose of the current study is to model the ecological complexity of Dendrobates pumilio, Dendrobates auratus, and other diurnal frogs in the lowlands of Costa Rica for purposes of conservation. Dendrobates pumilio, D. auratus, and other diurnal frogs were censused at Estacion Biologica El Zota in the summer of 2009. Biotic and abiotic factors thought to contribute to frog presence were measured. These factors were: microclimate (temperature and RH) and biodiversity (prey, predators, buttresses, nursery plants, other animals, leaf litter depth, tree diameter, and habitat). Results of Student t-tests showed that D. auratus and D. pumilio could be found in areas of significantly different temperature and relative humidity. Weak correlations were found between frog presence and a composite score for biodiversity. Correlations between biotic and abiotic factors were low; but showed important relationships within the ecosystem. Binary logistic regression analyses were run on all frog data revealing one partial model (other diurnal frogs) and one succesful model (D. pumilio). Predictors for the D. pumilio model are mean leaf litter, edge and riverine habitats,percent cover, presence of other diurnal frogs, and buttresses. The model for other diurnal frogs showed that habitat and presence of other frogs were the principal predictors of frog presence; but for mathmatical reasons did not get included in the model. These models can be used to target sites preferred by frogs for conservation efforts.

CREATING RNAI BASED ANTHELMINTICS
Elizabeth Lo-Ra Dick
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

Anthelmintic resistance in Haemonchus contorts poses a threat to U.S. ranchers. Researchers have found resistance to all anthelmintics within the nematode’s population. Current anthelmintics destroy parasites by shutting down metabolism or prohibiting muscular contractions. Previous experiments by the student tested the viability of RNAi containing plasmids shipped between 0O C and 110O C using Ceanorhabditis elegans as a model for H. contortus and to determine if H. contortus genes were homogonous with C. elegans genes that regulate drug resistance. The question this year was, can individual genes in H. contortus be targeted and blocked by use of RNAi (RNA interference) anthelmintics? The experiment focused on finding strong protein and nucleotide matches between C. elegans and H. contortus genes specifically targeted by current anthelmintic families. Thus the study was performed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to compare H. contortus and C. elegans genes by analyzing probable matches between the protein and nucleotide sequences. It was determined that the unc-38, unc-29, unc-63, lev-1, avr-15, avr-14, glc-1, glc-2, glc-3, glc-4, lat-1, lat-2, ben-1, and lev-1 genes that are involved in drug resistance had significant protein matches. No nucleotide sequences were found to be conserved between the two species due to incomplete H. contortus nucleotide sequence. In conclusion, it was determined that RNAi based anthelminics could be created to block resistance to all drugs except avermectin.

COLOR FEEDERS BIRDS PREFER
Tanner Jon Meidinger
Ashley Public School, Ashley, ND

The purpose of this experiment is to determine what color feeders birds prefer. I purchased six identical birdfeeders and spray painted them the following colors: blue, green, black, red, yellow, and white. I used spray paint that was safe for the birds and the enviroment. I plugged the feeding ports with cotton to prevent paint from getting inside the feeders, and to prevent contamination of the seed. I then hung the bird feeders evenly spaced onto an old rake wheel and hung it in a tree. I filled each feeder with 4 cups of mixed birdseed. I observed the feeders daily and added seed as needed. The date and amount of seed added was recorded. I obtained a record of the daily high and low temperatures from the local weather observer. I calcualted the average high, low, and mean temperature for the 18 weeks of the project.<br><br>The following amounts in cups of seed were added to the feeders during the experiment: Black--74.5, Blue--74, Red--73.5, Yellow--53, Green--47, and white--43.<br><br>The birds preferred the black colored feeder. The blue was a close second in preference. <br><br>The least favorite color was white.<br><br>The temperature did not make a difference in the color of feeder preferred. There was an increased consumption during the hotter and cooler temperatures. <br><br>The total amount of cups of mixed birdseed added during the experiment to the black bird feeder was 74.5 cups.

Tanner John Coppin
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To see the potential usage of chitin extracts as an environmentally friendly insecticide. Secondly, to determine ecological benefits to the agricultural industry. PROCEDURE: Collected 2 different types of HRSW seeds, 3 forms of chitin, and 2 chemical insecticides. Prepared chtin solutions (10:1). Used field application rates for the insecticides. TEST PLOT: Planted three replications of the two cultivars in a total of 36, 10-foot rows in length, 50 grams of seeds per row. Applied 2,000 mls of one of the treatments per row after four weeks. Allowed a three month growing period, then measured the plant height and harvested the wheat heads by hand. After harvest, extracted the seeds from the heads. The wheat seeds were then stored for further analysis (Percent protein, moisture content, test weight, bushels per acre, and falling number). PHEROMONE TRAPPING: To see the incidence of Hessian Flies to various wheat fields using the Hessian Fly pheromone trap. INSECT STUDY: Drop Method: Used actual contact of the extracts on Black Cutworms, Fall Armyworms, Russian Wheat Aphids, Mealworms and Hessian Flies to determine their fatality rate. Ingestion: To determine the killing effects of the extracts by impregnating a growth medium with one of the extracts or insecticide. Ladybug Migration: To see the effects of the extracts on the beneficial Ladybug. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY: Direct Contact: To observe the effects of the products on beneficial annelids. Soil Testing: To observe the effects of the products on the nurtrient level in soil. CONCLUSION: Overall, I feel that chitin has the potential be used as an environmentally friendly insecticide. Furthermore, I believe that chitin will become a major asset to the agricultural community.

THE EFFECT OF HONEY HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H202) AND ANTIOXIDANTS ON SMALL HIVE BEETLE (AETHINA TUMIDA) REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL
Lydia Louise McCormick
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, AL

Honeybees are the planet’s number one pollinator and, therefore, essential for our agricultural economy. Recently, the small hive beetle (SHB) (Aethina tumida) has become a widespread problem especially in the Southeast. While beekeepers have used a variety of traps or chemical treatments to control SHB, honeybees may also have natural defenses against this and other pests. <br><br> One possible chemical defense is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This oxidant is added to honey by the honeybee enzyme glucose oxidase. The hypothesis that antioxidants (catalase, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) will reverse the detrimental effect of honey H2O2 content on SHB reproduction/metamorphosis (egg-larvae-pupae-adult beetle) was examined. Groups of SHB (field-collected (f-SHB) and experimentally-grown (exp-SHB)) were incubated with beeswax, pollen, and honey (+/- H2O2 and +/- antioxidants) and larvae production, % pupation and adult survival measured. <br><br> Results showed that both f-SHB and exp-SHB underwent complete metamorphosis. This process was over 65-fold enhanced if the newly hatched exp-SHB were fed 4 weeks before reproduction studies. In both groups, catalase caused the highest SHB survival (124% control), larvae production (150% control) and % pupation (175% control). In contrast, ALA and NAC did not reverse the effects of H2O2. Using age-constant exp-SHB, H2O2 inhibited adult beetle survival 15-63% with 400-1600 µg/ml H2O2. <br><br> In conclusion, results support that honey H2O2 is a natural defense mechanism against SHB that affects all stages of metamorphosis. Future studies should explore how the biologic balance in honey catalase and glucose oxidase activities affects hydrogen peroxide content and, thereby, honeybee health.

BIRDS SPECIES IN BELEN RINCON NEIGHBORHOOD
Alejandra Alvarez_Garcia
Alcaldia de Medellin, Medellin, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

We want to know what birds inhabit the neighborhood of Belén Rincón in the city of Medellín, Colombia; also what types of birds are in the area, why are there more pigeons and doves, and not other types of birds. We also wanted to know why they lived under houses and roofs and not under trees, and why they don’t stay together as a group but are scattered. To do so, we analyzed their habitat and food for several days, and took record of these data. We wanted to show that, for bird species that inhabit our neighborhood, it is important that we take care of their habitat, making the area where they live cleaner and healthier. These results will also help to make future campaigns to increase awareness among residents of the neighborhood, for them not to kill the birds, and instead, they protect and preserve their environment, so we may continue enjoying their singing and beauty.

THE ANSWER IS IN THE SOLUTION
Emily Ann Schnoor
Sargent Hidh School, Monte Vista, CO

During the second and third runs the hypothesis was proven correct, Rainbow Trout eggs treated with 1.5 % salt, 2.0 % salt, 3.0 % salt, pH 4.0, pH 4.4, pH 5.0, pH 10 and the combined pHs and salt solutions did not produce hatch rates equal to or better than trout eggs treated with 1666 mg/l formalin. In run two and run three eggs treated with formalin produced mean hatch rate ranging from 80 % to 86 %. The next most promising treatments for both run two and run three were 1.5 % salt and pH 4.4 combined with 1.5 % salt producing hatch rates ranging from 65.7 % to 68.7 %. The pH only trials did not control fungus growth and hatch rates were similar to the control. <br><br>Fungus grew abundantly during runs two and three on the control and pH only trials. Some fungus was visible on dead eggs in other trials but did not spread quickly to the live eggs. <br><br>The data does indicate that 1.5 % salt is probably the best alternative to formalin with hatch rates up to 67 %. The second choice would be pH 4.4 combined with 1.5 % salt because of the hatch rates up to 68 % but it should be easier to add only salt. These findings could benefit not only American fish hatcheries by reducing employee exposure to the harmful effects of formalin but also fish hatcheries in underdeveloped countries where technology and the availability of chemicals are limited.

ANALYSIS OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS' GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL RESPONSE TO ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
Kristen Nicole Huyghue, MiKyle Crockett, 
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

Ultraviolet radiation from the sun can cause a variety of health problems in humans, including skin cancers, eye cataracts, and immunity deficiency to diseases. Caenorhabditis elegans serve as an optimal experimental model for humans and are therefore applicable to the studies of the effects of increased sunlight exposed on humans, caused by the depletion of the ozone layer. If different groups of C.elegans cultures are exposed to 100 watts of UV-A and UV-B rays, while maintaining constant temperature, then the effect will expedite the hatch rate when compared to the control group, grown in darkness. Stock cultures of C.elegans were maintained during this experiment. Escherichia coli was aseptically spread on nutrient agar plates. The seeded plates were inoculated with select C.elegan eggs. The eggs were exposed to 100 watts of UV-A and UV-B rays at a controlled temperature of about 23°C. The hatch rate was calculated every four hours for sixteen hours. UV-A rays had minimal effects on the C.elegans, observed during three generations. However, there were no eggs present in the dishes under UV-B rays by the end of the second generation. By contrast, the ultraviolet radiation had no observable affects on the E.coli. By keeping the lamp at a distance of 21 inches from the plates, the E.coli thrived. The hypothesis that exposure to 100 watts of UV-A and UV-B rays would expedite the C.elegans' hatch rate was supported, in part. Testing is still underway to determine the effects of ultraviolet rays in subsequent generations.

BEETLE MANIA II: EFFECT OF CO2 ENRICHMENT ON THE GROWTH OF TROPICAL SODA APPLE (SOLANUM VIARUM) AND THE RESULTING IMMATURE SURVIVAL AND ADULT REPRODUCTION OF GRATIANA BOLIVIANA (COLEOPTERA: CHRYSOMELIDAE)
Todd Joseph Condon, Gerald Francis Condon, 
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of CO2 enrichment on the growth of Tropical Soda Apple (TSA) (Solanum viarum) and the resulting immature survival and the adult reproduction of its biological control Gratiana boliviana (GB). Three experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions in central Florida. Primary testing studied how 15 TSA seedlings grew in three concentrations of CO2 (380, 580, 780ppm). The plant height and leaf count were recorded twice weekly for two months. 12 neonate GB larvae were monitored among three caged TSA plants from each CO2 concentration for three weeks. Results regarding TSA were significantly different in height due to higher concentrations of CO2. Results regarding GB immature survival suggested negative correlation with rising CO2 concentrations but were statistically inconclusive due to sample size.<br><br> Secondary testing studied a larger sample size of 30 GB larvae per CO2 concentration over a one month period. Results of this study indicated a negative correlation between survival rate and rising CO2 concentrations with statistical difference. As both test resulted in death of larvae samples in 780ppm CO2, adult survival/reproduction could not be tested. Therefore, a third test was conducted using remaining TSA plants of the primary and secondary experiments. 16 adult GB were placed on remaining two plants in each concentration. After three weeks number of surviving GB and egg count were recorded. Results of the third experiment agreed with results of the previous experiments. In conclusion both TSA and GB are negatively affected by CO2 enrichment.

DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL SCAFFOLD FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL BONE FORMATION USING BOVINE ADIPOSE-DERIVED ADULT STEM CELLS
Melissa Severn McDowell, Michael McDowell, 
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

Bovine adipose-tissue derived adult stem (ADAS) cells have been characterized and can differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. The objectives of this project were to determine if these cells can initiate three-dimensional bone formation when grown on scaffolds and to determine which three-dimensional scaffold (collagen, hydromatrix .75%, or hydromatrix .25%) is most successful for bone growth. Bovine ADAS cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation with phosphate buffered saline. The ADAS cells were plated into twenty four well plates, three wells for each scaffold, and three wells without a scaffold. The cells were cultured for twenty five days using osteocyte differentiation media, and the media was changed every 3-4 days. After twenty five days, all cells were stained for osteogenesis and then stained for the presence of three dimensional tissues. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was run on additional cultures. The cells on the collagen scaffold successfully produced a bone mass and three dimensional growth was seen in both hydromatrix scaffolds. These results suggest that using stem cells from adipose tissue to initiate bone growth is a viable option for those in need of a bone graph or transfer. These scaffolds can be implanted into the body and used for bone regeneration. They can also be beneficial in the treatment of bone-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as in decreasing the recovery time after a bone injury.

HOW BEACH SEDIMENT COMPOSITION AND TIDE LEVEL AFFECT THE SIZE AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF BUTTER CLAMS (SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEUS)
Auriel Catherine Clark, Lindsay Clark, 
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

Beach elevations between 2.0 feet and -4.0 feet at Middle Point, near Juneau, Alaska were sampled to determine how beach sediment composition and tide levels affect the size and age distribution of butter clams. Butter clams found in each sampling quadrate were counted and saved for later measurements of size, weight, and age. Sediment samples were also collected to determine substrate size composition by sieving through graduated screens. Statistical analysis showed that there are significant differences in age composition and sizes of butter clams from different tide levels, but no significant difference in age or size composition by sediment composition. However, there are small though statistically insignificant decreases in average age and increases in abundance with increasing percent of sediment less than 500 microns. The results also indicated that butter clams are most abundant between -3 and 0 feet in tidal elevation with the highest abundance at -1.0 feet. The oldest clams were found at 0 feet tide level with an average age of 25.3 years. The youngest clams were found at tide levels -3 and + 2 feet. The survey method developed for this study and the suite of data selected for collection and analysis could be used to determine age and size structures, year class strengths as indicators of recruitment events, relative abundance, and habitat requirements for other species of clams. These data are essential for development of strategies for sustainable harvest and culture of this resource. One surprising finding of our study was that many butter clams are far older than maximum ages previously reported in the literature. This may result in more conservative harvest guidelines in the future for this species than would otherwise have been prescribed.

SILKWORM CHARACTERISTICS IMPROVEMENT THROUGH GENETIC HYBRIDIZATION: PHAGOUS AND RESISTANCE OPTIMIZATION
Yue Zhu, Sirui Huang, Fei Chen
Shanghai Wei Yu High School, Shanghai, Shanghai, CHINA

Silkworm is an insect with great economic value, while its monophagous trait and weak physique formed during long time domestication have impaired its further application. So this project aims to effectively extend the phagous and improve the resistance of silkworm through genetic hybridization,which will highly increase the economic value and breeding simplicity of it. The research include following stages. (1)Hybridize two silkworm strains p50 and SC1 with paired characters to understand the genetic properties of phagous gene; then screen the individuals from BC1 generation with polyphagous and high-quality silk traits for next period hybridization. (2)Detect the discrepancy of genome sequences between the resistance gene, specially existed in the L10 strain, and normal gene through positional cloning and DNA sequencing. (3)Explore the disparity between mln gene of i04 strain and normal gene. Then use RNAi by injecting dsmln into final stage of larvae or earlier stage of pupae and observing the phenotype of moth to verify our conclusion about mln gene. The results showed: (1)The polyphagous trait is controlled by two recessive genes and there are some individuals in progenies that are polyphagous with high-quality of silk, indicating that those traits can be combined by hybridization. (2)Comparing to normal gene, nsd-z gene, the resistance gene, which is located on chromosome 17 has lost 8 nucleotides (8 bp deletions). (3)The mln gene,locating on chromosome 18, has lost exon 4 compared to normal genes. In next stage, the preliminary combination of several excellent traits will be completed through pyramiding breeding. So the conclusion is: a new strain of silkworm with polyphagous, strong resistance and high-quality silk traits can be cultivated through hybridization.

PLANKTON POPULATION CENSUS IN THE EASTERN SHORE OF PUERTO RICO - THE ATLANTIC OCEAN (PHASE IV)
Ruben Oscar Bras, Guillermo Mirandes, Alejandro Taveira
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plankton population in the region between Isla Ramos and Medio Mundo, in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. This area is near a marina where significant human activity takes place. Plankton is a microorganism which moves according to water currents. It is at the bottom of the marine food chain; not only is it the food source to small fish, but also to large whales. The study was conducted during winter; as a result, water temperatures were low, with an average temperature of 24ºC. This caused an increase in algae populations which include that of the diatoms. A boat served to reach the chosen area and a net was used to collect the samples directly from the water. To each sample, ten mL of red phenol preservative were added. Samples were collected at depths of around three, six, twelve, and fifteen meters, and then studied in the laboratory. Furthermore, other water samples were collected in order to be analyzed chemically. This part of the experiment (the chemical profile) was based on pH and oxygen levels. Moreover, observations and analysis of these samples were recorded in graphs to establish a statistical comparison with last year’s findings. At the time of study, between the months of September and January, phytoplankton dominated over zooplankton. It may be inferred that the marine ecosystem remained stable throughout the last four years but it is interesting to note a sharp absence of zooplankton compared to last years’ findings.

GROWTH OF MEALWORMS (TENEBRIO MOLITOR) WHEN FED PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS
Alexis Whitney Olson, Tayler Doorn, 
Mitchell High School, Mitchell, SD

People are led to believe that protein supplements will increase muscle mass since it is a major component of muscle cells. The common mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, was used to study the effects of protein sources on growth. <br><br> Mealworms were individually kept in containers containing food sources both high and low in protein – some of them marketed specifically for muscle development in humans. Individual worm length and mass were measured at 7 day intervals for 21 days. A total body protein analysis was performed using a colorimetric Biuret’s test at day 21. <br><br> The three high protein sources ranked lowest in percent change in length. The egg white protein source (5.1% increase) outperformed the whey protein source (-3.8%) at day 21. Wheat germ (4 g protein and 1.5 g fat per serving) stimulated the most growth (20.4%). High protein induced negative growth trends while fat and carbohydrates induced strong positive growth trends. With equal fat contents, the presence of high protein reduced growth. Total protein content was inconclusive.<br><br> A well balanced diet is required for optimum growth. The absence of fats coupled with a high protein diet reduced growth rates in T. molitor. If mealworms were accepted as models of human nutrition, these results would indicate that a high protein/no fat diet could be detrimental to growth. Further studies should investigate the strength of mature beetles raised from larvae on specific diets.

AN INVESTIGATIVE STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING MIGRATION OF JUVENILE AMERICAN EELS IN THE LOWER HUDSON RIVER ESTUARY
Laura Louise Hellmich, Dara Illowsky, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

This study examined the environmental variables impacting a sample number of juvenile American eels (Anguilla rostrata) migrating upstream in a tributary of the lower Hudson River estuary. This study aimed to determine the environmental conditions that enhance or inhibit the upstream migration of this species in a novel study location and to examine the effectiveness of a novel catching method, the eel mop. Glass eels were caught daily in a tributary of the Hudson River for ten weeks in the spring of 2008 and 2009 using a fyke net. Eels were counted and released and tide height, water temperature, lunar phase, and water turbidity were recorded. Additionally, average mass of the eels for each day of collection was measured. Over the two-year study period a significant negative correlation existed between eel abundance and water temperature (r=-.227, p<.05). The expected correlation between abundance and tide height, however, was not significant (p>.05), nor was the correlation between turbidity and abundance (p>.05). Migration peaked around the new and full moons and average mass showed a negative trend. The eel mops were found to be an effective method of catching glass eels, elvers, and yellow phase eels. However, the relatively low numbers caught in the mops demonstrate a lack of upstream accessibility. Results of this study can be applied to conservation efforts as well as use by fisheries and provides vital information for future studies of Anguilla rostrata.

DIET PILLS: RUSE OR REAL?
Divya Shenoy, Apas Aggarwal, 
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

With obesity on the rise, we're seeing advertisements of Acai, Alli, and Hoodia. Producers allege efficacy; however, when one reads the fine print, it asserts “results may vary." In an attempt to determine whether diet pills are effective, we designed an experiment using these three supplements coupled with a holding solution, our control group, on planaria (Dugesia dorotocephala). We used planaria because they divide spontaneously through fission and because they regenerate their lost parts. To determine whether the planaria were able to survive in the human dosage, we serially diluted the supplements and concluded that the planaria were indeed able to survive in the human dosages of the solutions at their weight. <br><br> An important distinction to note is that because these are diet pills, they shouldn't promote growth. We observed division at varying concentrations and noted that, when compared to the holding solution, there was more division in Acai and Alli and less in the Hoodia. Thus, it initially seemed that the Hoodia was the most effective diet supplement because it stunted growth the most.<br><br> We created a regeneration ranking system on a scale of one to five. One meaning no regeneration has taken place, five meaning regeneration is complete. When looking at head to tail regeneration, all three diet supplements promoted more regeneration than the holding solution by day seven. Conversely, when looking tail to head regeneration, all three diet pills had reached a higher ranking by day four. <br><br> So we saw not once but thrice that when the planaria were in the diet pills, they grew more so than when they were in the holding solution. Perhaps claims of weight loss made by consumers are due to their own efforts, not the diet pills alone.

CAN ROSE BITTERLING SPAWN IN A DUMMY MUSSEL? WONDER OF AMINO ACIDS THAT INDUCE SPAWNING AND EJACULATION
Fumiaki Taniguchi, Takanori Hirata, Arata Nishigaki
Seifu High School, Osaka-shi, Osaka, JAPAN

Rose bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus, are fish that spawn their eggs in the gills of freshwater mussels. In a preliminary experiment we investigated mussel cues that elicit spawning behavior by bitterling. Spawning in a dummy mussel made from a pet water bottle worked, though the eggs weren’t fertilized. Thus we developed an “improved” dummy mussel with a “perfect” artificial solution. <br><br>We investigated the following: 1) Which color of dummy mussel was preferred and what angle it should be set. 2) How 12 amino acids affected bitterling behavior. 3) The amino acids in the water flowing from mussel gills using thin-layer chromatography and　ion exchange chromatography. 4) Allowed fish to spawn in the dummy mussel. 5) Analyzed which amino acids were present in the ovarian fluid and sperm of bitterling.<br><br>Results showed: 1) The most effective mussel color was black, and best angle was 30°. 2) When dummy mussels released a solution included the amino acids Gly, Ala, Trp, or Gln, bitterling spawned. 3) The solution from a mussel contained Ala, Gly, Gln, and Lys in high concentrations. 4) Lys, Ala, and Gly, were found in ovarian fluid and induced sperm release by male bitterling. <br><br>On the basis of results we concluded that the amino acids in the solution from a mussel induce spawning and ejaculation by bitterling. It seems that the relationship between bitterling and mussels is a co-evolutionary one linked by common amino acids. We succeeded in fertilizing bitterling eggs by refining the design of our original dummy mussel.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLONY SIZE, WORKER BODY SIZE AND PRODUCTIVITY IN TEMNOTHORAX REGATULUS ANTS
Chelsea Jewel Powers, Damian Alzua, 
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Social insects including honey bees, wasps, and ants demonstrate complex behavior such as cooperative brood care, reproductive division of labor, and task specialization. In some sense, social insects can be viewed as super organisms, functioning at a level above the individual. In ants, social complexity is often associated with worker body size. Consequently, this study assessed the effects of colony size on worker body size and colony production in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. This research contributes new information about colony ontogeny and growth. Twenty colonies of T rugatulus were collected from Mt. Lemmon, Tucson AZ and raised in the lab at the University of Arizona. Colony mass was measured by means of an Ohaus Analytical Plus AP2500 balance. Each colony was photographed and the head width of individual ants was measured using ImageJ. The following can be deducted from the data collected: Larger colony size does not have greater variability in worker body size (t=0.74, df=9,P=0.48) nor do they have larger workers (t=0.06, df=9, P=0.95). Additionally, larger colonies produce proportionally fewer brood compared to small colonies (t=2.15,df=9, P<0.05). The data also shows that brood size does not vary with brood number (t=0.02, df=9, P=0.98). This suggests that in ants, large colonies may be less efficient than small colonies.

IDENTIFYING TRENDS OF WOLBACHIA PIPIENTIS INFECTION IN VARIOUS SPECIES OF ARTHROPODS
Jeannie Nguyen Tran, Van Tran, Katerina Trinh
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

The Wolbachia bacterium is the most prevalent disease amongst arthropods. The bacterium can alter the reproductive process of species in one of four ways: parthenogenesis, cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, and male-killing. The proliferation of Wolbachia may eventually result in a shift in mating strategies, a change in the reproductive and cell biology of arthropods, speciation, or even extinction of arthropod populations. <br><br> The purpose of our experiment is to identify the infection patterns of Wolbachia in arthropods through DNA analysis to better understand the proliferation of the Wolbachia gene and its effect on arthropod populations. <br><br> We believe that regardless of location, Wolbachia is present in 20% of those collected in nature and that the infection rate is higher in insects that are commercially bred.<br><br> After identifying the sample arthropods, which were either store-bought or collected in nature, we used polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to replicate segments of the DNA strands of each sample. Though the use of agarose electrophoresis, we separated the DNA fragments by size and then stained the gels with ethidium bromide. The banding pattern on the gels indicated the presence or absence of Wolbachia in our samples. <br><br> Though research is still being conducted, 132 arthropods have been tested thus far. The DNA of 50 samples were inconclusive and of the remaining 82 that tested positive for cytochrome c oxidase (the internal positive control for insect DNA), 34.1% were also positive for Wolbachia. The presence of Wolbachia in commercially-raised arthropods was 54.5%, compared to 20.4% in those collected in nature.

EFFECT OF ADELGES TSUGAE ON SASAJISCYMNUS TSUGAE EGG PRODUCTION
Yohana Dierolf, Rebekah Morgan, Erika Williams
Brevard High School, Brevard, NC

Hemlock trees in western North Carolina are dying due to infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Because Sasi beetles (Sasajiscymnus tsugae) imported from Japan are effective predators of hemlock woolly adelgids, they are being raised in laboratories in the United States for release in hemlock forests. The current procedure for raising sasi beetles requires weekly collection of adelgid-infested hemlock branches as a food source. Less expensive procedures for rearing beetles and egg production need to be identified. Although honey is an adequate food source for sasi beetles, it is not known if adelgids are required for the reproductive capacity of sasi beetles. To address this question, sasi beetles obtained from the NC Department of Agriculture were reared in jars containing a water source and honey or glucose as a food source. Control jars contained heathy tree branches. Test jars contained hemlock branches infested with hemlock woolly adelgids. Twenty beetles were placed into each jar, along with gauze pads for egg-laying sites. On a weekly basis, the beetles were transferred to clean jars with a fresh supply of water, sugar and tree branches. The number of live beetles and newly-laid eggs were recorded each week for a period of five weeks. The results revealed that egg production occurred only in jars that contained hemlock woolly adelgids. Nearly equal rates of mortality were observed in all jars. We conclude that adelgids stimulate sasi beetle egg production, but are not required for sasi beetles.

ADSCITA STATICES: NIGHTLY VARIATIONS OF APPEARANCE IN A MOTH
Markus Enekvist, Tor Djarv, 
Katedralskolan, Lund, SWEDEN

Adscita Statices is a metallic green day active moth, which was at one time observed to change color during night into a rust red. This raised the question whether this was a reoccurring change, and what caused it. The hypothesis during the study was that it changed color, and did so because of external factors.<br><br>In mid July the moth was observed every evening and morning for ten days in its natural habitat. A group of moths was located and the amount of color changed moths, as well as surrounding temperature, luminous intensity, air pressure and humidity was measured over time. The next night the procedure was repeated. The evening and morning experiments displayed different results; in the evening the change in color was probably caused by humidity, but in the morning they returned to their original color when the temperature and luminous intensity rose. Due to this uncertainty in the result a second experiment was carried out. While holding all variables constant at certain values in a container with 25 individuals, it was possible to determine which one that had the strongest relation to color change. The results of this experiment showed that humidity was the single most important variable of the ones included. <br><br>The conclusion of the study was that A.Statices changed color every night, and did so when shrouded with a thin layer of water, as it would appear on them as dew at night and evaporate with heat, come morning.

EFFECT OF THE ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL ON THE SPIN PATTERN OF THE NEPHILA CLAVIPES SPIDER
Fadi Tarek Abumoala, Ralphdy Vergne Montes, 
Blanca Malaret, Sabana Grande, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation was to verify if the exposition of Nephila clavipes spider to different concentrations of isopropyl alcohol will affect its spin pattern. The problem was: What effect does the exposition of Nephila clavipes spider to different concentrations of isopropyl alcohol have on its spin pattern and web structure? The hypothesis formulated was that when Nephila clavipes spider is exposed to different concentrations of isopropyl alcohol, its spin pattern and its web structure is affected. Nine Nephila clavipes spiders were collected and divided into three groups. Spiders in aquarium “A” received no treatment, spiders in aquarium “B” were treated with isopropyl alcohol that had a concentration of 70% and the ones in aquarium “C” were treated with isopropyl alcohol that had a concentration of 90%. The liquid was sprayed into the corresponding aquariums and the spin time was measured. This was repeated three times during the six weeks experimentation period. The web’s structure was observed and the diameters of the first five rotations of the webs were measured after 24 hours of study. Data analysis evidenced that a greater concentration of isopropyl alcohol has a greater effect on the web’s structure and pattern. It was demonstrated that the exposition of the Nephila clavipes spider to isopropyl alcohol had an effect on its behavior, interrupting its web spin pattern. The projection for this research is to use the spider’s spin pattern as a biological indicator of environmental changes inducted by any exposition of chemical substances to the environment.

Plucking of bees’ honey is a practice comes from ancient times. People used to pluck bees’ honey during the waning fortnight period and not within the waxing fortnight period. Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the position of the moon on water percentage of bees’ honey. <br><br>Our hypothesis was “Water percentage of bees’ honey in bee hives increases during the period of waxing while it decreases during period of wanning half of the lunar”.Sixteen samples of bees’ honey were collected from four different places during four main phases of the lunar circle (Full moon day,New moon day, 3rd Quarter moon day, 1st Quarter moon day).The samples were taken from the same bee hives at the same maturity stage. <br><br>Flow rate, specific gravity, Nature of dropping and water percentage of each bees honey sample were measured. Flow rate of bees’ honey was 0 .49 mms-1, 0.55 mms-1,0.40 mms-1 and 0.45 mms-1.Specific gravity was 1.18, 1.11, 1.28 and 1.15. The nature of dropping in bees’ honey as big drops, big drops,very thin thread, and thin thread,The water percentage of bees’ honey was 28.73%, 30.24%, 25.73% and 28.23%.All these average amounts have been recorded in order to Full moon, New moon, Third quarter moon and First quarter moon respectively. <br><br>. Water percentage of bees’ honey was highest during the full moon and new moon days.Lower during the third quarter moon and first quarter moon days.It is lowest during the third quarter moon days.<br><br>The data analysis indicates that the first half of the warning period of time is the best time to pluck the bee hives. During this period the percentage of water in bee’s honey is low. Second half of the waxing period of time is not good to pluck the bee hives.During this period the percentage of water is higher than the other period.

In the project "Development of Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) fed with three types of preys (diets)”, eggs of Harmonia axyridis were collected and we waited until the larvae’s hatched; then 10 larvae were separated and we began a comparative experiment between diets. Individuals were isolated in containers (2.5 cm in diameter by 5 cm high); five individuals were given immature stages of Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) as their diet, the other five larvae were given immature stages of Gynaikothrips garitacambroneroi (Thysanoptera: Phleotripidae), and the development of Harmonia axyridis with different diets was observed. The larvae of Harmonia axyridis consumed both Diaphorina and Gynaikothrips, despite its known preference for aphids. The growth of individuals fed with Diaphorina was faster than those fed with Gynaikothrips. It was noted less preference for Gynaikothrips; since there was much more consumption of Diaphorina. We conclude that Harmonia axyridis could be used as a biological control agent for Diaphorina and, in special situations, they may be adapted to eat Gynaikothrips as a last resort for survival.

EFFECTS OF RESVERATROL ON WEIGHT GAIN, FEED CONVERSION, AND LITTER COMPOSITION OF GALLUS GALLUS CHICKS
Wendell Shane Riels
Seminary Attendance Center, Seminary, MS

Broiler production is a major component of Mississippi’s economy. Weight gain, feed conversion, and the health of the flock are of utmost importance. Organic production is also a concern because antibiotics and growth enhancers are deposited into the environment through the litter; consumers ingest these additives, which could then impact their health. <br><br> The focus of the current study is to replace the antibiotics and growth enhancers with a supplement produced naturally in fruit. This supplement is resveratrol. If ingestion of resveratrol enhances growth, lowers feed conversion, and suppresses bacteria growth, then introducing chicks to this supplement will result in a larger organically grown broiler with positive economic impacts on the farmer. <br><br> For this experiment, the chicks were separated into three groups of fifteen chicks: a control, a low dose, and a high dose group. A stock solution was made by diluting resveratrol into water. Two groups were given specific doses of the solution in their water for eight weeks. All groups were fed the same amount of feed each day. At the end of each week, the chicks were weighed, litter samples were taken, and feed conversion was calculated. <br><br> The pH and bacteria count of groups L and H showed a significant difference compared to the control: C group had higher moisture content while weight gain and feed conversion of groups L and H were more desirable than the control. Although the results look encouraging, more testing must be done before resveratrol can replace antibiotics in large scale broiler production.

ARTHROGRYPOSIS MULTIPLEX, PHASE TWO
Bailey Lynne McKay
Franklin Public Schools, Franklin, NE

Arthrogryposis multiplex is a lethal genetic defect in a specific line of Angus cattle when two carrier parents are mated. The calf is born dead with a bent and twisted spine, is small and thin due to limited muscle development, and have rigged contracted or highper extended legs. This genetic defect is caused by a simple recessive gene. The purpose of this study is to test the recessive defect in purebred Angus carrier cows that are flushed to increase their gene pool. The carrier females were flushed to non carrier males and the embryos were tested prior to implanting in a recipient female. It was hypothesized that fifty percent of the embryos would be non carriers.<br><br> Two hundred eighty-nine fertilized embryos from fifteen cows that were flushed were biopsied. One eighth of the embryo was biopsied using an inverted microscope and a biopsy knife. The biopsied part was placed in a test tube and tested for Arthrogryposis multiplex. The data showed that 157 out 289 embryos were non carriers or 55%. All of the fertilized embryos from each flush were tested making this an excellent sample. The results support the hypothesis, therefore proving the hypothesis correct. A question remains why there are 30 embryos or 10.38% that were unreadable. These embryos can not be retested until they calve. The contributions of this project will help understand the effects of recessive genes on futre genetic defects casued by simple recessive genes.

THE EFFECTS OF LECITHIN ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE WILD STRAND, DPY-11 STRAND AND BLI-1 STRAND OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Tori Erica Graf
Hillsboro High School, Hillsboro, OR

This lab was designed to find the effects of lecithin, a phospholipid, on three different strands of Caenorhabditis elegans worms when it is placed in their environment. A single, small drop of lecithin was placed into a Petri dish with one strand of worms. This was repeated with 10 trials for three (3) strands of worms. The time worms spent in contact with the lecithin was measured and population estimations were taken. Results were analyzed by an ANOVA test. The wild strand and bli-1 strand of worms entered the lecithin, then crawled away. The dpy-11 strand of worms did not leave the lecithin; I stopped recording at 180 seconds. The results of this lab show that there was no effect on the Wild strand and bli-1 strand. The lecithin had an effect on the dpy-11 strand of Caenorhabditis elegans; their life cycle was paused, and there were no eggs present in the environment for 4 days. These results could lead to studies of the metabolic processes in Caenorhabditis elegans that allow the worms to process fat.

THE EFFECTS OF NICOTINIC ACID, RESVERATROL, AND RAPAMYCIN ON THE LIFE SPAN, REPRODUCTION, AND ABILITY TO COPE WITH TEMPERATURE STRESS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Aaron Samuel Greenfield
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

According to the Whitehead Institute and Harvard University, two important pathways, the Sirtuin1 gene and Target of Rapamycin protein, have shown to increase lifespan and ability to cope with temperature stress by different chemicals: nicotinic acid, resveratrol, and rapamycin. The purpose of this study was to determine whether various concentrations of nicotinic acid, resveratrol, and rapamycin affected lifespan, ability to cope with temperature stress, and reproduction of Drosophila melanogaster. The hypotheses were increasing concentrations of nicotinic acid and resveratrol would increase ability to cope with temperature stress and lifespan of flies. Adding rapamycin to the mixture would have a synergetic effect and would prolong lifespan. Rapamycin would not increase the hardiness of the flies. Reproduction would not be negatively affected as well. <br><br> Flies were anesthetized, their sex was determined, and 75 flies were placed in seven tubes. There were six experimental groups, each with either 0.3g of nicotinic acid, 0.3g of resveratrol, or 50mg of rapamycin. The offspring of the flies were placed into a heat and cold stress test. A Dunnett’s Test was performed, which showed results were statistically significant with p-values less than 0.01. <br><br> In conclusion, nicotinic acid and resveratrol increase lifespan and ability to cope with temperature stresses of Drosophila melanogaster. Adding rapamycin allowed for greater lifespan extension without any effect on their ability to cope with temperature stresses. Continual study of the sirtuin gene is extremely important. Life changing possibilities, such as retarding age related diseases, may be discovered by unlocking the mysteries of this gene.

STUDY ON MECHANISM OF CONTROLLING WHITEFLY USING THE LEACHING SOLUTION OF LEMON LEAVES
Xiaoyang Yu
Beijing No. 101 High School, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

Abstract: This study was based on our previous work on controlling whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) using the aqueous leaching solution of lemon leaves. The present experimental results showed that the solution had a significant controlling effect on whitefly. The killing rates of whitefly from 93% to 100% were observed when the solution at the concentrations of 6% (CT1), 10% (CT2), and 13% (CT3) was added. The effects of CT1, CT2 and CT3 on movement ability of whitefly treated for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h were analyzed. The results showed that the leaching solution could impair the movement ability of whitefly, and the repression effect was more obvious with the increase of solution concentration and treatment time, which was reflected by the movement distance in 3 min reduced from 94.25 mm (control) to 28.50 (CT1), 15.25 (CT2), and 12.25 (CT3) mm in 48 h, respectively. The RT-PCR method was taken to determine the expression of six genes related to the movement ability of whitefly. It was found that the leaching solution of lemon leaves could inhibit the expression of Troponin, Tropomyosin and Paramyosin genes after the treatment for 48 h. Therefore, the controlling mechanism of leaching solution to whitefly could be preliminarily explained by starvation death of the insect for the loss of movement ability caused by inhibiting the expression of movement associated genes. As a result, the cultivated plant of rose could grow more healthily and flourishingly. <br><br>Key words: Whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum); Leaching solution of lemon leaves; Movement ability; Gene expression; Rose

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND POPULATION INHIBITION EFFECT OF PLANT ESSENTIAL OIL ON THE DIAMONDBACK MOTH
Lin Gan
Fuzhou No.1 High School, Fuzhou, Fujian, CHINA

The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella is a major cosmopolitan pest of Brassica and other crucifer crops all over the world. Over use of insecticides has dramatically increased its resistance. To explore an environmentally friendly control methods is increasingly emergent. <br><br> In this project, the hormone extraction and detection procedure for juvenile hormone (JH) and moulting hormone (MH) in DBM was established, the effect of essential oil from Chinese Prickly Ash (CPAEO), Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Star Anise (SAEO), Illicium verum , and Felon Herb (FHEO), Artemisia argyi on JH and MH titers of DBM was determined, the changes in indoor population size of DBM brought by the chosen essential oil were investigated, and finally the control efficacy of the essential oil on DBM in the field was tested.. The results indicated that essential oil from CPAEO and SAEO at comparatively lower concentrations could significantly change expression dynamics of both JH and MH in the 3rd instar larvae of DBM. Moreover, the application of essential oil from CPAEO on the parental population of DBM could drastically decrease its offspring by 94% and this was confirmed in the field. So, essential oils from plants could be used in DBM control. Management of insect pests based on endocrine disruption is practicable and more environmentally friendly compared with the conventional insecticides and it should become an alternative way for pest control.

BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE FOR CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY IN GREEN ANOLES
Rachel Emily Reon
The Governor's School for Science and Technology, Hampton, VA

In a lateralized brain, processing of cognitive information is evenly distributed between two hemispheres. Researchers previously thought this characteristic to be uniquely human and result in superior cognition. Recent evidence shows that lateralization of the brain is not only present in humans, but also widespread in vertebrates. The objective of the current study was to identify behaviors that indicate cerebral asymmetry, also known as brain lateralization, in the Green Anole (Anolis carolinensis). Behavioral assessments administered were: startle response test, predatory response test, feeding choice test, and other secondary tests. The lizard’s eating behavior was observed, examining their preference in striking direction and their success rate in relation to the strikes in a specific direction. Consistent preferences in these behaviors indicate evidence for cerebral asymmetry in reptiles. Following 100 trials, the startle response (water response) indicated a 49% preference to the right side, a 30% preference for the left side, and 21% of the time the lizard showed no preference. In the snake response (predatory response) test, the lizards cumulatively showed a 3:1 favoring to the right eye, indicating that fear is perceived by the right eye and left side of the brain. In the striking tests, the lizards showed an equal favoring to right and left strikes. The present study makes a significant contribution to the field of comparative cognitive neuroscience by providing a new animal model that offers unexpected insights into the evolutionary origins and neuronal mechanisms of cerebral asymmetries.

BIRDS EYE VIEW: DEVELOPMENT OF A METHOD TO DETERMINE GENDER IN GREEN CHEEK CONURES
Alexandra Kaye Badeaux
Catholic High School New Iberia, New Iberia, LA

This project was a study to see if a method to determine gender of a green cheek conure could be developed using UV illumination. To discover if there were any visible differences, birds were photographed in a specially created box under UV light using modified cameras. <br><br> 400+ photos were taken in three different settings, one to capture full spectrum lighting, another to capture UV fluorescence, and a third to photograph UV reflectance. The regions photographed were chest, vent/underside of tail, cheek, back, upper side of wing, underside of wing, and upper side of tail. Three different types of green cheek conures were used: normal, yellow sided, and pineapple. The photographs were analyzed visually and transparencies were made highlighting the fluorescent or reflectant areas. After further analysis, three of the regions where the most visible differences were found were isolated. A scoring system was created with defined guidelines to properly score each bird. This scoring system was then applied to a blind study, with an accuracy rate of 93.75%. Inter-rater reliability was also test with twenty inexperienced participants.<br><br> The results showed that there is a visible and statistically significant difference between the males and females in UV fluorescence (p<0.00005) as well as in UV reflectance (p<0.001). Females show more fluorescence and more reflectance than males. Statistical significance remains in the blind study (p<0.005), and in the inter-rater reliability phase (p<0.003). The difference may seem minimal to us, but birds have much better vision than we can hope to replicate.

THE UROGENITAL SYSTEM OF MALE RHYACOTRITONIDAE: AN ANATOMICAL AND PHYLOGENETIC STUDY
Emily Rachel Wilson
Parkway Central High School, Chesterfield, MO

This study documents the urogenital anatomy of the salamander family, Rhyacotritonidae through histological and gross anatomical methods, in effort to better understand the urogenital system of this new family and the value of cranial urogenital characters in a phylogenetic context. Observation of the urogenital system included the testis, kidney, collecting ducts and cloaca in four specimens of Rhyacotritonidae. The pelvic (caudal) kidney had seven or eight collecting ducts that did not anastomose with each other or the Wolffian duct similar to the collecting duct condition of Cryptobranchidae and Hynobiidae; all emptied into the cloaca individually. Collecting duct epithelial height increased during mating season (spring) as did cloacal gland size. The Mullerian duct was not contained in the lamina propria of the Wolffian duct, as observed in other amphibians. A central testicular canal opened into four or five vasa efferentia leading to the Wolffian duct. The use of nine novel urogenital characters, and seven from Sever and colleagues (1991), reconstructed a phylogeny for Urodela with a tree length of 26 steps and a monophyletic Salamandroidea. Although the urogenital system of Rhyacotriton shares characteristics with Cryptobranchidae and Hynobiidae, the phylogenetic reconstruction placed them in a collapsed clade with Dicamptodontidae, Ambystomatidae, Proteidae, Salamandridae, and Plethodontidae. Urogenital characters presented as valid and valuable characters for phylogenetic analysis, as the reconstructed phylogeny provided a respectable view of urogenital relationships throughout Urodela. Novel characters, when traced on supported phylogenies with MacClade, supported the morphological phylogeny published by Duellman & Trueb in 1986.

THE EFFECT OF ERYTHROMYCIN ON THE EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF ZEBRAFISH
Kody Michelle Nelson
Central High School, Saint Joseph, MO

The purpose of the investigation was to determine what effects erythromycin had on the embryonic development of zebrafish, Danio rerio. Erythromycin is an antibiotic in a group of drugs called macrolide antibiotics, which slow the growth or kill bacteria in the body. It does this by preventing the bacterial cells from producing proteins by binding to the 23S rRNA molecule and blocking the exit of the peptide chain, without interfering with the cells of a human. It is used to treat many different bacterial infections caused by bacteria such as, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Serial dilutions of 1 and 10ppm of erythromycin and 7.2pH phosphate buffer were prepared and groups of 10 embryos were exposed to the different concentrations along with a control. They were observed microscopically with data collected through pictures taken with a digital microscope. The embryos in the control hatched at a normal rate, meaning they hatched from their egg sacs within 72 hours of fertilization, according to the The Zebrafish Book. (Westefield, 2000). . The embryos in the 1ppm solution had a reduced hatching rate of about a day. This showed little significant data to support or reject an alternative hypothesis, however more data is still being collected from the different concentrations, as well as more trials of the control for comparison.

CONTRACEPTIVE CONUNDRUM. A MULTIGENERATIONAL STUDY OF EXPOSURE TO BIRTH CONTROL IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Hannah Claire Pagels
Grove High School, Grove, OK

According the Contaminant Candidate List 3 distributed by the U.S. EPA, ethinyl estradiol (estrogen) and norethindrone acetate (progestin) are present in public water systems. The presence of birth control (estrogen and progestin) in water has been associated with reproductive abnormalities in animals. The purpose of this experiment was to see the multigenerational effects of birth control on offspring sex ratios and reproduction rates in Drosophila melanogaster. Same-aged Drosophila were exposed to the synthetic estrogen, ethinyl estradiol, and a synthetic progestin, norethindrone acetate, in five concentrations (E=2mcg/L P= 100mcg/L, E=5mcg/L P=250mcg/L, E=10mcg/L P=500mcg/L, and E=20mcg/L P=1000mcg/L) for three generations. <br><br> It was hypothesized that populations of female to male Drosophila would increase in successive generations as compared to the control. Offspring produced were affected in the majority of exposed concentrations, resulting in less male, more female offspring and a number of flies of unknown sex. The highest concentration produced less female and more male offspring, this result was contrary to other exposed groups and the control.<br><br>It was also hypothesized, that birth control would increase reproduction rates in Drosophila compared to the control. This hypothesis was rejected. The total number of offspring at all levels decreased rather than the hypothesized increase.

COPING WITH COPEPODS: THE INFLUENCE OF MACROCYCLOPS ALBIDUS ON THE SURVIVAL AND MORPHOLOGY OF VIBRIO CHOLERAE 01
Madeleine Amanda Ball
Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Dallas, TX

Freshwater copepods have been successfully used to control mosquito larvae in lab and field trials. Still, an assessment of the unintended consequences of that use is warranted. This project explores if, and/or how, the inoculation of copepods into environmental water samples impacts the presence and morphology of naturally occurring Vibrio cholerae 01. It was hypothesized that the cholera-causing vibrio could survive in freshwater in a dormant state, but only when live copepods were present. Individual 50ml static bioassays were performed exposing both live and deceased, mature, non-gravid, copepods to distilled and effluent, lotic, and lentic environmental water samples at normal and enhanced salinity levels. Controls excluding copepods were performed. Assays were then tested for the presence of Vibrio cholerae 01 using a fluorescent stain specific for the surface antigen of 01 lipopolysaccharide in the vibrio’s outer membrane. Viable-non-culturable vibrio was found in all microcosms, excluding controls, at all salinity (0.05-1ppt) and pH (6.6-8.4) levels. Adding live copepods resulted in 27% fewer colonies, but colonies present were 232% larger and demonstrated vertical biofilm architecture associated with viable vibrio. Conversely, increasing salinity alone resulted in more, but less organized, vibrio colonies. Viable-non-culturable vibrio also survived in the presence of dead copepods; however, these colonies lacked advanced biofilm formations after 96 hours. Unintentional importation of Vibrio cholerae 01 is problematic as demonstrated by the ongoing Haitian cholera epidemic. Utilization of copepods as a bio-control for container-breeding mosquitoes will create new and/or enhance existing reservoirs for Vibrio cholerae 01 in or near human environments.

SEEING WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE: VISUAL EXPERIENCE AND TOP-DOWN PROCESSING IN HONEYBEE
Kevin Sean Chen
The Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, CHINESE TAIPEI

Prior visual experience information can strengthen the ability of pattern discrimination. Such ability of utilizing prior learning experience to increase discrimination ability is so-called top-down processing in the visual system, by which eyes communicate the information of patterns to the brain.<br><br> A Y-maze was used to conduct a series of behavioral experiments, training and testing honeybees to discriminate patterns. After training by being shown simplified patterns, honeybees had performed top-down process and then were able to discriminate those complicated patterns which they could not do so before training.<br><br> We found that the pathway of honeybees’ top-down messages is color-blind in the communication network. The geometrical information such as shape, visual angle, and contour can be top-down processed, but neither position nor color. We also discovered that honeybees can discriminate advanced information, such as searching for moved features or discriminating contrast pattern groups which are beyond the original threshold.<br><br> The mechanism of honeybee’s top-down process is conducive to pollinating and dealing with visual information more effectively. The particular communication path accelerates the selected patterns to the brain and awakens previous relevant visual experience, which enhances the ability to discriminate. With a brain smaller than 1 mm3, honeybee can deal with complicated visual information. It works because of the feature extraction and top-down process mechanism.

BIOLOGY OF LAND SNAILS IN NAKHONSAWAN PROVINCE NORTH OF THAILAND
Suwatthanachai Phomprasith
Takhliprachasan School, Nakornsawan

From the preliminary observation of the area in Takhli District Nakhonsawan Province ,which is covered with lime stones, there were many living organisms not usually found in other geological surrounding. Land snails was one of the plentiful organisms observed. The objectives of this project was to survey the diversity of land snails in local area and the physical and biological conditions of their habitats. The life cycle, behavior of lacal land snail was also studied. The limestone areas was divided into 11 stations where the snails present in each station were recorded and classified. A total of 2 subclasses , 16 families, 24 genera and 31 species of land snails were recorded. There were also varieties of plants and animals in the area:10 species of plants and 13 species of animals. General geographic and environmental description of the area were also noted. Different eating behaviours were observedmong the land snails found in the area: consumption of only fruits and vegetables, consumption of bothplants and animals especially small land snails. We chose to further study on Cryptozona siamensis because it was local land snail of Thailand and was abundant. Their life cycle, behaviors in breeding, hybernations and humidity were recorded. The snail hang themselves from a surface with the help of secreted mucus which could carry very large weight of the snail. The mucus of Cryptozona siamensis also exhibited antibacterial activity such as inhibition of growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This study can be the basic knowledge for conservation of local land snail.

THE EFFECTS OF METHYL FARNESOATE ON THE MOLTING BIOLOGY OF JUVENILE RED KIN CRABS (PARALITHODES CAMTSCHATICUS)
Lia Katherine Domke
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

Crustaceans, commercially important animals, grow by molting—shedding their exoskeleton. Hormones regulate crab molting biology and chemicals that mimic crustacean hormones may interfere molting. Methyl farnesoate (MF), a hormone secreted from the mandibular organ in crustaceans, aids in molting, morphogenesis and developement. MF is similar to insect juvenile hormones for which pesticides were developed. Metheprene, a chemical pesticide that may act like MF, resides in the environment for up to 150 days. <br><br>To determine effects of MF on red king crab (RKC) molting biology, specifically to investigate whether MF would change circulating molting hormones (ecdysteroirds), RKC were exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; solvent control) or MF four times over forty days. Hemolymph was sampled three weeks after starting the treatment and 18 days later. Ecdysone concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Crabs exposed to DMSO (n=9) exhibited ecdysone levels that increased from 6.6 ng/ml to 34.1 ng/ml while crabs exposed to MF (n=10) exhibited levels that decreased from 13.1 ng/ml to 9.3 ng/ml. There was not a significant difference between control and experimental crabs (t-test p>0.05). Some control group crabs started a molt cycle and had high ecdysone levels after three weeks, leading to high variation in the control not present in the MF treatment. With a larger sample size the effects of MF might have been detected. Statistical analysis showed a non-significant trend for MF to decrease circulating ecdysone (p=0.19). The data is inconclusive on whether methoprene or analogs affect the molting cycle of juvenile RKC.

NATURAL PARASITIC RESISTANCE
Addison Thomas Hilyard
Central High School, Brooksville, FL

The purpose of the experiment is to see if a feral horse population that's left untouched in their natural environment will build up and immunity to the parasites in their environment over time. The hypothesis is, If a feral horse population that's never been treated for parasites is exposed to certain parasites in its environment over a series of generations then it will build up a natural immunity because of genetic evolution.<br><br> The procedures for this investigation were very sufficient. First, you went to Cumberland Island and found five spots that had feral horses in them. Then, you collected fresh fecal samples from those five sites. Next you suspended the feces in a salt solution. Followed by viewing the liquid under a microscope in a McMaster slide. The number of eggs viewed is multiplied by 25 to get the Eggs per gram. Then you disposed of the liquid in a safety area. <br><br> The data collected is as follows in an overall average for each of the five testing sites. For site 1 Dungeness Ruins: 290 epg, site 2 Dungeness Dunes:183 epg, for site 3 Dungeness Dock: 127 epg, site 4 Seacamp: 387 epg, site 5 Stafford Field: 662 epg.<br><br> The final conclusion is that since the horses do in fact have parasites they have not built up an immunity but they have built up an extreme tolerance to the parasites in their environment.

A STUDY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND ACTIN AND MYOSIN PRODUCTION
Nathan Lyne Frantz
Fleming High School, Fleming, CO

“A Study of Dietary Supplements and Actin and Myosin Production” looks at how dietary supplements effect Actin and Myosin production in muscle cells. The data was collected by DC-protein assays and electrophoresis gels. Crayfish were purchased as the test animal and banded. They were then fed three different combinations of dietary supplements, creatine, amino acids plus electrolytes, and creatine plus electrolytes. Legs were amputated from the crayfish and were frozen for further testing. A leg was amputated from each crayfish once a week. After 21 days the legs that had been amputated were dissected to retrieve muscle tissue. This was massed, and protein was extracted from the tissue. Tests were done to determine protein content and estimated Actin and Myosin Content. As the period of ingestion and digestion of the dietary supplements increased, the mass extracted from the legs of the crayfish increased, however the content of protein (measured in µg) decreased significantly. All values returned for protein content were statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval. The largest value returned from a T-test on these values was 0.040186. The amount of estimated Actin and Myosin did not show very much indication of change with the largest change being .36%. This data does not support the hypothesis. However, it does substantiate previous research suggesting that the increased muscle mass is due to cellular hydration. This data is important in that it lends information on how to increase the body weight of a person or an animal relatively easily.

HOG WILD: AN IN-DEPTH STUDY COMPARING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF SUS SCROFA DOMESTICA BEING FED ORGANIC SWINE FEED AND CONVENTIONAL SWINE FEED
Austin James Rohrs
South O'Brien Community High School, Paullina, IA

Organic livestock production is becoming popular. Because of this, an experiment that compared the productivity of hogs with conventional versus organic feeds was designed. Hogs were tested on their average-daily-gains (ADG), feed-to-gain ratios, and ending carcass qualities as determined by an ultrasound. The purpose of the project was to inform pork producers which feed would be more productive.<br><br>The project was started on October 31, and ended on January 2 resulting in 9 weeks of experimental data. Four littermate gilts were purchased to start the project. Two gilts were housed in each pen. The gilts were weighed every Sunday night during the 9 week period. Upon completion of the test period Kelly Bruns, Animal Science Professor at SDSU, used ultrasound to obtain the additional data needed. Using the equation (8.588-(21.89*BF) + (3*LEA) + (.465*HCW)/HCW)*100, the gilts lean percentages were determined.<br><br>Conventionally fed gilt’s ADG was 1.96 lbs. per day while the organically fed gilt’s ADG was 1.89 lbs. per day. There was a 38% difference in feed efficiency between the two test groups of gilts. The conventional gilt’s ratio was 3.58 lbs. feed/1 lb. gain while the organic gilt’s ratio was a staggering 5.76 lbs. feed/1 lb. gain. The conventional fed gilts ranked first and second with lean percent’s of 59.84% and 60.12% and organic gilts ranked third and fourth with percent’s of 56.85% and 57.54%.<br><br>This research clearly showed that conventional swine feed is more productive and profitable for pork producers than organic feed.

SWINE WEANING WEIGHTS: HOW DOES THE INJECTION TIME OF OXYTOCIN EFFECT WEANING WEIGHTS?
Cayla Pieper
Holy Trinity Catholic Junior Senior high School, Fort Madison, IA

I chose this project because my family owns a farrow to finish hog operation. In our operation when the sows are finished farrowing the piglets are reliant upon the mother’s milk for 21 days. The sows are given an injection of Oxytocin on days one and two after farrowing. Oxytocin can be given to the sow to help during the second and third stages of labor. It also can give the sow the feeling of relaxation around other sows. In my project we are researching the use of Oxytocin in relation to its “Letdown Reflex”. The “Letdown Reflex” is when mother sows are lactating the Oxytocin acts upon the mammary glands to help release milk for the piglets to drink. I wanted to find out if giving more Oxytocin for more than the first two days could effectively produce heavier piglet weights at weaning time. Based on my research, my hypothesis is that injecting Oxytocin on days one through five would be most effective to increase the piglets weaning weights. Obtained Oxytocin and other materials. How I tested my hypothesis is that I divided the sows into four different groups according to the times of injections. All sows were injected with Oxytocin on days one and two with different days there after for the four groups. We weighed piglets on day 20 (the day before piglets are weaned off of their mother). My hypothesis was not upheld. The piglets that had the highest weaned weight came from the sows that received Oxytocin on days one, two, seven, eight, nine, and ten.

COPEPOD CULTURING: CONDITIONS FOR MAXIMUM YIELD PER GENERATION
Julian Ohiro Kimura
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Today, certain marine animals cannot be kept for research due to their specialized diet on micro-organisms known as copepods. This is caused by the copepod’s unusually long period of sexual maturation. The reproduction of copepods cannot keep up with the demand for food, forcing laboratories to keep multiple cultures. This project aims to eliminate the need for excess cultures and maximize the productivity of copepod reproduction through manipulations of culture conditions.<br><br> This study tested three variables: food, light, and water temperature. Each trial measured one variable at a time, lasting four weeks. Cultures were five gallon buckets hooked up to an airstone for circulation. Each culture started with 100 gravid females of the species Tigriopus Californicus. Every two weeks, water was agitated, forcing copepods into suspension, and three 20ml samples were taken. Next, the averages of the three samples were used to estimate the population.<br><br> Results showed that of the three types of algae used, Isochrysis yielded up to 360% more individuals. Temperature trials showed that copepods will not survive in temperatures above 75 degrees, and a temperature of about 69 degrees was ideal. Finally, a light intensity of 75 watts produced slight increases in population.<br><br> The data shows Tigriopus Californoicus cultures produce the most individuals when fed with Isochrysis algae paste, kept at 69 degrees Fahrenheit, and kept under 75 watt bulbs. With this data, a wider variety of marine animals such as corals and pipefish would be able to be kept for both research and conservational reasons.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF TICKS TO PREVENT LYME DISEASE USING ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES
Ryan Daniel Kerr
Danbury High School, Danbury, CT

Lyme disease is a serious health concern in the U.S. with more than 30,000 reported cases each year. It is caused by the bite of a blacklegged tick infected by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Symptoms of this disease include neurological complications, arthritis and paralysis, and it is resistant to treatment in many instances. I measured the prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection to be as high as 92% using direct immunofluorescence microscopy. Presently, the only method to control tick populations is through environmentally harmful insecticides. These insecticides kill not only ticks, but other non-target species including mammals. In order to solve this problem, the feasibility of biological control was tested using entomopathogenic nematodes: naturally occurring microscopic roundworms. I tested the effectiveness of two different species on their ability to kill ticks over a 7 day period. Neither species were effective in killing normal adult ticks. However, both were effective in killing engorged adult females with an LD50 of 60/cm2. The nematodes were approximately half as effective against ticks compared to a positive control of mealworms (LD50 25/cm2). Since only engorged female ticks lay eggs, entomopathogenic nematodes can potentially be used on a large scale to decrease tick populations and prevent Lyme disease in an environmentally-sound manner.

THE EFFECT OF URBANIZATION ON OCCUPANCY AND DETECTION RATES OF EASTERN SCREECH OWLS IN SUBURBAN AREAS
Kyle Thomas Bardwell
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Little research has been done to determine eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) sensitivity to human encroachment, and how the habitat preferences of these owls have changed due to urbanization. This study aimed to determine the occupancy and detection of eastern screech owls relative to different degrees of human development. A novel method of detection was designed and employed using citizen science volunteers. Sixty-four volunteers reported owl broadcasting calls, and detection and occupancy rates were calculated. Geographic Information System was used to determine the distance between owl survey points and preferred development types. From the 64 volunteer survey points, 37 eastern screech owls were located. Using detection and occupancy models, we found the significance of development features on the locations of owls. The top occupancy model psi(dFOR+dHD+dOD),p(dFOR+dHD) found that screech owls were predominantly located in areas further away from forest and further away from high development. However the top detection model psi(.),p(dFOR+dHD) shows the detection rate was higher at points closer to forest and high developed areas. Eastern screech owls show a preference to live in areas in close proximity to open development described as an area with less than twenty percent impervious surfaces, which indicates Megascops asio population is resistant to low levels of human encroachment.

A CONTINUING STUDY OF AGGRESSION DURING SHELTER COMPETITION BETWEEN INVASIVE AND INDIGENOUS SPECIES OF CRAYFISH
Vincent Jacob O'Leary
Wheeling Central Catholic High School, Wheeling, WV

Orconectes rusticus is an invasive species of crayfish that has spread throughout the country at an alarming rate. Orconectes rusticus propagates quickly, displacing native crayfish, and can destroy all vegetation in an ecosystem, which can quickly lead to the devastation of aquatic life. This project’s goal was to determine if O. rusticus is more aggressive than native crayfish and to see if this increased aggression aids in its ability to obtain a shelter. Early research led me to hypothesize that an increase in aggression, either offensive or defensive, will lead to an increase in residency. Orconectes rusticus and Cambarus carinirostris participated in 88 interspecific and intraspecific bouts for the shelter. Resident crayfish would have to defend its shelter from an invading crayfish for 10 minutes. The observed behaviors were given a numeric value based on their level of aggression. Averages of these numbers were combined to find an average cumulative sum of the aggression and the percentage of time spent underneath the shelter. The data partially confirmed the primary hypothesis, since O. rusticus, especially when acting as a resident, was statistically more aggressive than C. carinirostris (P<0.0001), but there was no relationship between overall aggression and residency. Interestingly, O. rusticus did not show as much aggression when fighting to obtain the shelter as opposed to defending it (P<0.0001), an adaptive behavior that may be key to its success as an invader. A better understanding of O. rusticus was gained by this project and should lead to methods of prevention.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY USING SCALE INVARIANCE OF MULTIPLE COUPLED OSCILLATIONS
Daniel Jacobs Kramer
Lynbrook Senior High School, Lynbrook, NY

Generalized arousal of the Central Nervous System (CNS) is the controlling mechanism of all of an organism’s behavioral responses. To study the extent to which genetics influence CNS arousal, we bred mice into groups displaying high and low levels of arousal and studied how changes in circadian biology correspond with changes in arousal. Levels of activity of each mouse were monitored for approximately six days, with food, water, and temperature kept constant. Power law was used to analyze rest intervals, Fano factor to analyze activity statistics, and Wavelet Transforms to generate power spectra and to analyze the extent of interactions between oscillators. There was noticeable variation in power law distribution among males and females, with more variations within the male group. Power law was usually followed by the high-arousal mice, and was almost never followed by the low-arousal mice. It appeared that stronger circadian oscillation corresponded with weak ultradian oscillation, and vice versa. Moreover, besides rhythms noticed due to circadian and ultradian oscillators, a third rhythm was present (more strongly in females), possibly due to the estrous cycle. Being able to profile individual mice by detailed variations in behavior, creates an effective “fingerprint” for identifying each individual.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS OF BASAL DINOSAURIA WITH RESPECT TO BODY MASS ANALYSES
Brian Patrick Ralph
Smithtown High School West, Smithtown, NY

Recent discoveries of basal Dinosauria species have made it possible to study general evolutionary trends within the clade. In this study, basal Dinosauria was studied to determine evolutionary changes with respect to body mass. The body masses of 104 basal dinosaur species were estimated from femoral length measurements. Femoral length strongly correlates to body mass in many extant groups and is believed to correlate similarly in Dinosauria. Phylogenies for the clades Theropoda, Sauropodomorpha, and Ornithischia were obtained and branch lengths were estimated from fossil occurrence data. Ancestral body masses were estimated for each phylogeny using linear parsimony. Finally, in the program BayesTraits, four tests were run on each phylogeny: random walk model (null model), punctuated evolution, directional evolution, and modifications of model parameters. These tests output maximum likelihood scores. Likelihood Ratio Tests checked for statistically significant differences between models. All failed directional evolution tests, but passed punctuated evolution and parameter tests, signifying an adherence to punctuated equilibrium. With these results we can argue a case study in support of macroevolution, in addition to understanding other integral trends since body mass correlates with significant biological functions.

THE MIRACLE OF LIVING BY TERMITES
Ahmed Hassan Hussein
Moubarak Secondary School, Alexandria, EGYPT

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to use the ecological niche of termite colonies for the benefit of humans. It is known that termites feed on papers wastes, particularly cardboards. In a trial experiment to demonstrate this capability it was found that termites produce hydrogen as a by –product and high nitrogen content from the decay of termites body. It was proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of using termites for getting rid of wastes, as a nitrogen fertilizer, and to produce hydrogen as a source for renewable energy. To prove the hypothesis, information about the ecology of termites and its favourable conditions e.g. temperature, moisture, and preferable food sources was collected. Accordingly, several experiment were conducted, using a designed bioreactor that was constructed for growing a colony of termites on wastes of cardboard, and rice straw as food sources, at different temperature and constant moisture conditions. Results showed that the digestion of one sheet of cardboard (60gm) produce about .0375 litres of hydrogen in a temperature of 340. Using rice straw as a food source food with its high cellulose content and produced more hydrogen and nitrogen- richer wastes. It then therefore concluded that many environmental problems can be solved using termite colonies that includes the queen, for solid wastes management by digestion of paper, cardboards, and rice straw in termites guts, a valuable source soil fertilizer by using the soil used in the bioreactor, , and a renewable source of hydrogen.

THE EFFECT OF LYCOPENE AND VITAMIN A ON THE REGENERATION OF PLANARIAN FLATWORMS
Kaylee Anna Bahr
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

The regeneration of human organs and tissues are being heavily researched to decrease the wait time for patients waiting for organ transplants. Scientists have been experimenting with Dugesia tigrina, also known as planarian flatworm. A unique characteristic about these flatworms is that they can regenerate a new full worm from only a section of a former worm. This experiment explores what effect an introduction of Lycopene and Vitamin A would have on the regenerating planarian flatworms. Three dilutions were made at concentrations of 1/1,000, 1/10,000, and 1/100,000 of a control group, Lycopene, and Vitamin A. The worms were cut in half and divided into the different environments so observations could be taken of their growth. After two weeks three data collections were taken of the worms. An one-way (unstacked) ANOVA test was run comparing each concentration with the three different solutions. The results rejected the null hypothesis that stated Vitamin A would have the most success at aiding the regenerations of planarian flatworms. For the 1/1,000 and 1/10,000 concentrations the control environment had significantly better results. Since Lycopene and Vitamin A are both fat soluble chemicals which means that they had to be denatured which could have affected the way the planarian flat worms absorbed them in their systems. In fact the chemicals could have actually clogged their breathing pores, preventing higher levels of oxygen needed to grow.

GENE SEEKER
Bailey Lyn Palmer
West Grand High School, Kremmling, CO

In my experiment, I was trying to determine if there is a specific phenotype that has the genotype of the genetic abnormalities of Tibial Hememilia (TH) and Pulmonary Hypoplasia with Anasarca (PHA),both in which are recessive in cattle. I created a list of criteria of 10 specific traits which each cow will be scored on a scale of 1-10 on each of the traits. The cow must score a 90 out of 100 to be considered a phenotype. If the cow does not score a 90 or higher, she will be placed into the non-phenotype group. There will be 25 phenotypes and 25 non-phenotypes. I will then genetically test each cow to determine if there is a phenotype that has the genotype of these genetic abnormalities. My hypothesis for this experiment is that there is in fact a specific phenotype.

THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF ETHANOL EXPOSURE ON SOMITOGENESIS AND CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT IN ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL OF FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME
Ayana Jamal
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) may be the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation in the U.S. and can evolve into an epidemic in future years. In this study, an animal model of FAS was used to determine the effect of ethanol on early development and understand the complex molecular pathways affected. The purpose was to characterize the phenotypes of ethanol treated zebrafish embryos at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) and 72 hpf to determine if defects at both stages were correlated. <br><br>Transgenic zebrafish were studied under a confocal microscope under anesthetic for real-time visualization. Images for both control and treated embryos were analyzed at both stages for midline patterning malformations. <br><br>The somite means between treated and un-treated embryos at both ages are statistically different and standard deviation values suggest that ethanol makes somitogenesis a less reliable and predictable process. The 24 hpf embryos illustrated the earliest manifestations of future defects and 72 hpf embryos showed the terminal defects, suggesting that vital developmental signals lack throughout embryogenesis. This work is consistent with current theories that ethanol exposure reduces Retinoic Acid and Sonic Hedgehog signaling throughout development, permitting the rise of severe structural and behavioral defects because of their crucial role as developmental signals. A zebrafish model of FAS could help develop new approaches to reduce, and eventually reverse, the effects of fetal alcohol exposure because the complex molecular pathways targeted by ethanol exposure in the fetus are more fully understood.

RESPONSE OF THE FEMALE CARIBBEAN FRUIT FLY
Chloe Lorraine Hale
Citrus High School, Inverness, FL

The Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa, is a critical agricultural pest of tropical fruit crops in the United States. Studies have been analyzing the A. suspensa courtship and mating behaviors, to potentially use mating disruptions as a vector to control populations. During courtship, males group together in a lek on the undersides of leaves where they release a pheromone and fan their wings to broadcast a calling song to attract females. Since the males are stationed on a leaf, their legs transmit vibrations from their acoustic signal through the plant. Recording and reproducing these vibration signals indicated a significant difference between the number of females active during the call vibrations and the number of females active without vibrations. This is also done with a playback of the male psyllid call and white noise to determine if the females respond to specifically the male fruit fly’s call, or if the females respond to any vibration signal. This will suggest that females can detect the vibrations from the male fruit fly’s calling song, and the vibrations can be used as a mechanism to reduce the likelihood that the female will move away from the male that approaches her to mate. Disrupting the transmission of the male calling vibrations might prove to be an effective method to disrupt mating and control the populations of these agricultural pests.

PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON ADULT AND LARVAL STAGES OF TENEBRIO MOLITOR, YEAR II
Alexis Whitney Olson
Mitchell High School, Mitchell, SD

Since high protein supplements are so highly recommended for strength building and diets, Tenebrio molitor beetles developed from larvae raised on them should be stronger than those fed more conventional diets. What are the effects of these supplements on their fecundity and survival? <br><br>T. molitor larvae were reared in individual compartments while being fed a variety of high protein supplements and conventional diets. Time to develop, fecundity, and beetle strength were evaluated.<br><br>The highest protein containing diet did not produce the strongest beetles. Textured soy protein (53.6% protein) produced beetles significantly stronger than those fed infant rice cereal (6.7% protein, P=.01) and whey supplement (75.8% protein; P= 0.01). Graphical analysis shows an optimum protein (47.71%) and carbohydrate (38.46%) percentage for maximum strength. Larger beetles do not pull harder (R2 =.063) and there is no significant difference between males and females. Survival of those fed wheat germ, infant rice cereal, and textured soy protein had significantly higher survival rates. Beetles from larvae reared on rice cereal had the lowest mating success rate (resulting in larvae) – 43%. Those reared on a whey containing supplement (75%) and wheat germ (71%) had the highest fecundity rates. <br><br>The study of T. molitor nutrition is important for many reasons. Knowing what inhibits their development could be used to control their growth such as in an infestation. On the contrary, you could maximize their growth if you wanted to use them as a protein food source for animals such as birds, lizards or…even humans.

EVALUATION OF CLIMATE TRENDS AND SALAMANDER POPULATION DENSITIES, A THREE-YEAR STUDY
Nathaniel Wade Hubbs
Camden Central High School, Camden, TN

Recent declines in amphibian populations have been reported in many areas of the world. Fluctuations in temperature and precipitation have been identified as possible causes of decline. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends between terrestrial salamander densities and climate data. For three years, salamanders were monitored using artificial cover boards. Stations were established along 200-meter transects and monitored during the fall (September through November). Captured salamanders (97 total) were identified to species, measured (snout to vent length in mm), and released. Monthly precipitation and temperature data were collected from the National Interagency Fire Center’s weather station that was located within five miles of the study area. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify data trends. Salamander density was the highest (4.45 individuals/m2) during the period with the highest precipitation (307.3 mm in 2009). Salamander density was the lowest (1.15 individuals/m2) during the warmest study period (16.5 °C in 2010). The temperature during 2010 was 0.4°C higher than the average fall temperature for the region (16.1°C) and the precipitation was 50% below average. Salamander density declined by 74.2% from 2009 to 2010. The correlation coefficients for the salamander density and climate data were strong (0.95 for precipitation and -0.82 for temperature). The scatterplots also indicated a strong correlation between climate data and salamander density. Based on field observations and data analyses, the hypothesis was supported and correlations and regressions can be used to develop relationships between salamander densities and climate data.

WAYS TO ENHANCE CELL REGENERATION
Christina Ren
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA

The purpose of this study is to discover substances that would enhance cell generation and repair. Two promising candidate substances, resveratrol and deer antler velvet, were identified through extensive literature research. An experiment was designed to assess their impact on regeneration of Lumbriculus variegates, (California blackworm), chosen because of its rapid rate of segment regeneration. It is hypothesized that worm segments exposed to these substances will display greater regeneration rates than the control. Prior to regenerative experimentation, toxicity levels were determined by observing deaths of blackworms in different concentrations. To assess the effects of the substances on regeneration rates, 96 blackworms were cut in half. Six blackworm fragments were placed into one of the following concentrations: 0.00, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 20-ppm. After four weeks, t-test revealed for resveratrol,1-ppm and 2-ppm concentrations had increased tail segment regeneration in both anterior and posterior fragments with statistical significance. The 2-ppm resveratrol generated 55% more tail segments in the head and tail ends than the control. Blackworms exposed to deer antler saw even better positive results. All concentrations at 1-ppm and above were statistically significant. On average, the 7-ppm deer antler generated 101% more tail segments in the head and 98% in the tail. These data suggest that resveratrol and deer antler velvet, at the proper dose, can enhance cell growth and regeneration in invertebrates. Should the same conclusion hold for mammals after further experiments, the implications for wound-healing, sport performance, anti-aging, and life extension could indeed be very intriguing.

BUTTERFLY LEARNING: CAN MONARCHS (DANAUS PLEXIPPUS) BE TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE SHAPES AND COLORS?
Laura Cecilia Rosenwald
Urbana High School, Ijamsville, MD

In the insect world, butterflies are typically considered to be low ranking on the intelligence scale, especially when compared to social insects like ants and bees. However, new research has concluded that butterflies can be trained to recognize colors in a behavioral context, such as a food (nectar) reward. In this experiment, I tested the hypothesis that butterflies can also be trained to recognize shapes for a food reward. Newly eclosed (hatched) Danaus plexippus (Monarch) butterflies were trained to recognize either circles or squares, keeping the area of the two shapes the same. The shapes were either purple or green, colors previously shown to be neutral in terms of innate preferences within other studies. After training, individual butterflies were tested to measure the number of visits and the amount of time spent at the model (shape and color) to which they had been trained. The best-supported finding from statistical analysis of the numerous tests concluded that butterflies do have the ability to learn shapes, but that color plays a more prominent role as a cue for feeding in their lives. This study has implications for better understanding butterflies’ ability to adapt to their environments, an important finding since butterflies play a major role as pollinators in ecosystems.

THE EFFECT OF BISPHENOL A ON CAENORHABDITIS ELEGAN’S REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY
Kathryn Marie Merkling
East Noble High School, Kendallville, IN

The objective was to see if Bisphenol A (BPA) affects the reproduction of Caenorhabditis elegans. It was hypothesized that if BPA was introduced into C. elegan’s environment then their population growth would be negatively impacted. For this experiment agar was made with 1000ppm, 500ppm, 100ppm, 20ppm, 100ppb, 20ppb, and 0ppb BPA in solution, poured into Petri dishes, and culltured with E. coli (food source). Agar squares 1cm x 1cm from C. elegan stock culture were then transferred to establish 1st generation Petri dishes, and they matured for 5 days. On the fifth day, 5 second videos and photos of 5 random spots with area of 1mm x 1mm were taken of all Petri dishes. The 2nd and 3rd generations were established by the same method stated previously except prior generations were used to establish new generation. Photos and videos taken where then evaluated together to collect and verify population counts. The data showed that 1000 ppm and 500 ppm dosages of BPA compared to the control had a negative effect on the population growth of the C. elegan with a p value < .025. In low dose groups there was no significant difference from the control in 1st generation. In 2nd generation there was a statistically beneficial difference that resulted in a p value of < .025, however by the 3rd generations there was no significant difference from the control group. In conclusion the data showed that Bisphenol A does have a negative effect in high doses on C. elegan.

STURGEON GROWTH RATE IN MONOCULTURE AND POLYCULTURE
Lauren Elise Davis
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL

This project was designed to compare the growth rates in one species of fish (monoculture), and in the same species of fish combined with two other types of fish (polyculture). Polyculture is considered to be an efficient way to grow fish in aquaculture, by maximizing the use of water and tank space. For this experiment, I choose to grow three species of fish: the first species of fish are sevruga sturgeon, Acipenser stellatus, the second species are tilapia, Tilapia sp. and the third species are paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. The sevruga sturgeon are the focus of this experiment. The fish were weighed at the beginning and end of the experiment. I then compared this data to determine which tanks had the greatest impact on the growth of the sevruga sturgeon. The study comprised of five tanks: in the first study there was a monoculture of sturgeon and a polyculture of tilapia and sturgeon. In the second study there was a monoculture of sturgeon; a polyculture of sturgeon and paddlefish; and a polyculture of tilapia, sturgeon, and paddlefish.<br><br> My hypothesis is if tilapia feed in the water column and graze on algae, and if paddlefish are filter feeders, then the growth of the sturgeon will not be affected due to the fact that the sturgeon are bottom feeders.<br><br> In the beginning of this experiment, the fish were weighed using a digital scale. I then calculated the amount of food that they were fed six days a week, which was 2% of their body weight. After fifty days of this routine in the first study and after thirty days in the second study, they were weighed again and their ending weights were determined. The ending weights were compared to the beginning weights to find the growth rate of the sturgeon in the monoculture and polyculture tanks.

STUDYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRONCHIAL TISSUES USING ANTIBODIES
Carolina Pelaez
Union City High School - Academy for Enrichment and Advancement, Union City, NJ

The main function for the survival of humans is to obtain energy to carry out all the metabolic processes necessary for survival. The lungs have the ability to obtain Oxygen gas from the atmosphere and oxidize the dissolved glucose in the blood stream of living organisms into carbon dioxide gas, water and energy through the process of cellular respiration occurring in the mitochondria of all cells. By selecting the optimum antibody staining procedure, the normal development of lungs in chicken embryos were studied in order to maximize the function of lungs, prevent lung disease, and enhance treatment for different conditions. The antibodies mark the proteins in the bronchial tissues and allowed these tissues to be analyzed under an Inverted Research Microscope (Eclipse TE2000-E) using an immunofluorescent staining technique, which allows for sensitive light microscopy with ABC Elite Vector and Fluorescein Tyramide reagents. The results obtained through ongoing research will allow for further research concerning different factors, such as pressure and volume, which may disturb normal bronchial tissue development, and will provide sufficient data for the development of gene therapy, artificial lungs, or alternate treatments for pulmonary diseases that concern the human lung.

STRESS RELEVENCE AFFECTING FEMALE PRODUCTIVITY TRAITS IN SWINE
Neela Ann Andres
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

The purpose was to determine whether Porcine Stress Syndrome has an effect, if any, on a mothering sow. Research indicates that sows that are stress negative are better mothers than stress carrier sows. More importantly the sows without the stress gene (nn) had more piglets then stress carriers (Nn). On average more piglets were born alive. Stress negative swine also lost an average of 1.25 piglets per litter. Carriers averaged 2 pigs per litter. Stress negative swine also have better milk production therefore, faster growing piglets. Piglets from stress negative sows have a 9.135 lbs. average growth span meaning the piglets gained 9.135 lbs from their first day to the 21st day. Stress carriers have a 4.852 lbs. average growth span. Making a difference of 4.283 lbs. per litter. When observing stress carriers and stress negative sows there is a difference. <br><br> Sows were tested in different areas such as: birthing ease, number born, number born alive, average litter weight on the day of birth, average litter weight seven days later, number alive after seven days, average litter weight twenty-one days later, finally, the number alive twenty-one days after birth. All was done to insure an accurate Sow Productivity Index (SPI).

THE EFFECTS OF SODIUM BENZOATE ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Claudia Nicole Dennler
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

Sodium benzoate has been used extensively in the food service industry as a preservative. I wanted to see how it would affect Drosophila melanogaster. Thirty-six prepared culture vials were placed in an incubator and kept at 23°C to ensure a controlled environment. Powdered media was moistened with serial dilution concentrations (starting at 70 mM and ending with 7 µM) of sodium benzoate dissolved into distilled water. The concentration range was selected based upon my prior research with Brassica Rapa and a study conducted showing the effects of 8mM on human peripheral blood cells (Mpountoukas et. al). Data that was collected three distinct days over a nine-day period included wing mutations, length, width, population, and number of types of mutations. Results showed increased mutations in all concentrations. The 70 mM concentration displayed a slowed life cycle with a minimal production of flies. During the second observation, there were only 14 flies in this concentration, a meager 4.81% of the control’s numbers. The third observation yielded 57.6% productivity when compared to the control, but the majority of females displayed turquoise bellies. Conversely, the 70 µM solution displayed increased productivity. The sodium benzoate did not have an effect on width or length. An ANOVA test conducted on the data resulted in a 0.000 p for the number of types of mutations, 0.008 p for percent mutated, and 0.004 when looking for population differences, which validates the data as being significant. This supports my hypothesis of sodium benzoate having an effect on D. melangaster.

THE EFFECTS OF CAGE NATURALITY ON THE SCIENTIFIC VIABILITY OF MOUSE MODELS IN RELATION TO STRESS AND COGNITION
Casey Jacob Acklin
The Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

The experiment attempted to increase the scientific viability of laboratory mice by designing laboratory cages to mimic the natural environment of the mice. Since studies have shown that enrichment is beneficial, it was hypothesized that a more natural setting would result in more natural behaviors, increasing scientific viability. In addition, the results of a 2010 pilot study showed reduced stress in prenatal mothers and their pups living in natural cages. Stress was measured using competitive fecal corticosterone ELISA assays. In addition, T-Maze Continuous Alternation Tasks were run to determine short term working memory, and Open Field Tests were run to determine general exploratory behavior. Procedurally, four females were mated to one male, in three types of cages: standard, enriched, and natural. At three-weeks-old, pups were weaned and the original breeding females were mated again. At six-weeks old, the pups were mated. Feces were collected from the females pre- and post-mating, pre- and post- birth, and pre- and post- weaning for all cages. Fecal collections and litter weights were taken twice per week for three weeks post weaning. In all of these tests, it was found that mice living in the natural cages had significantly better results than mice living in either the standard or enriched cages: stress levels were reduced while memory, exploration, and weights were increased. All of these results translate into a better mouse for scientific research. If natural cages were used in research laboratories, results would be made more reliable, and public health would greatly benefit.

SOCIAL IMMUNITY OF APIS MELLIFERA AS AN ANTIMICROBIAL INDICATOR OF CCD
Ashley Nicole Sowder
Southmoore High School, Moore, OK

The goal of the experiment is to test for antimicrobial activity and in doing so, derive any indications that could point to one or both of the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder or, out of the colonies tested, which are most likely to fall next by examining social immunity. The first phases of the experiment included collecting samples of approximately 30 bees and honey, then collecting nerve tissue through dissection and hemolymph by removing the antenna and spinning the bees upside-down in a centrifuge for five minutes. The next phase included testing the extracts against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillis flavus and Candida albicans using the Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion method. The zones of inhibition were recorded by hive, tissue and pathogen, and graphed. The spring post-survey demonstrated that this method does portray the overall health of a hive via their social immunity. Hive 5, whose results were highly unreliable in testing, previously had tracheal mites, which ultimately suppressed the social immunity of this hive. After analysis, Hives 4 through 12, all collected from the same hobbyist, showed results indicating stable health, notably those of Hives 1, 9 and 10. Trial 2 included decreasing the dilutions of both the hemolymph and the nerve tissues to investigate whether or how much the higher concentrations of the extract would change the overall antimicrobial activity. The increased concentrations resulted in more drastic differences between hives and better defined strengths and weaknesses, and also a change from “long-lasting” to a “fast-acting” immune response.

FORENSIC ENTOMOLOGY: USING INSECTS FROM THE GENUS SARCOPHAGA FOR COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT CADAVER DETECTION
Bailee Lynn Slack
Camdenton High School, Camdenton, MO

Clandestine graves are a common occurrence in murders, and a conviction is much more likely in the event that the victim’s remains can be located. The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not Sarcophaga insects could be used as a cost effective and efficient means of clandestine grave detection.<br><br>To test whether the flies could would have a response to cadavers, the fly groups were exposed to plots at the University of Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Center. Their responses were recorded via webcam inside in an enclosed pvc pipe with a fan to draw external air samples through the device (Wasp Hound) for subsequent analysis. A control was completed in a nearby wooded plot where no bodies were present. To determine from what distance the Sarcophaga insects can detect decay, frozen rats (deceased from natural causes) were obtained and buried and a transect was created 100 m from each sample. The flies were placed inside the Wasp Hound and gradually moved towards the sample. Their response was viewed via webcam and a mark was made when a response was indicated; the distance from the mark to the sample was measured and recorded. A similar transect was created using human placental tissue to compare the flies abilities with those of trained cadaver dogs.<br><br>The data showed that the flies were able to correctly identify and respond to the natural scent of decaying human cadavers (p<.05). This implies that the flies could be used as an accurate and practical tool in forensic investigations. The flies were able to detect the decay 20 m further away than the cadaver dogs. It is likely that more bodies could be located, which could result in more convictions.

EXTRACTING NECROMONE REPELLENTS FROM FOOD OILS
Chase Carter Gross
Solon High School, Solon, IA

Small invertebrates that assemble in large numbers use chemical communication to avoid sites of potential danger. One class of chemical signals has been termed "necromones" as they seem to repel individuals away from areas contaminated by fresh invertebrate corpses. Such signaling crosses genus boundaries and has been observed in both insect pests and terrestrial isopods. Free fatty acids mediate this death avoidance signal with the long chain unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid among the most potent. Free fatty acids are water insoluble oils and prone to oxidation making them poor candidates as commercial repellents. Sodium salts of fatty acids (soap) are water soluble and inexpensive to produce. I hypothesized that sodium linoleate would repel small invertebrates and that a linoleate-rich soap would contain similar repellent activity. Using a sow bug shelter-seeking model, I confirmed that reagent linoleic acid at a concentration of 90 mg/ml displayed 91+/- 6% (mean +/- SD) repellent activity compared with solvent control. Chemical grade sodium linoleate also repelled sow bugs from shelters with the effect varying with concentration: 95 +/- 5 % at 100 mg/ml, 95 +/- 5% at 50 mg/ml, and 29 +/- 28% repellency at 10 mg/ml. This repellent activity was not replicated by sodium stearate, a long chain saturated fatty acid (22 +/- 22% repellency at 50 mg /ml). I made linoleic-acid rich soap from Grape Seed oil (> 70% linoleic acid) and linoleate-poor soap from Coconut oil (< 2% linoleic acid) using standard sodium hydroxide saponification. The linoleate-rich soap had 97 +/- 4 % repellent activity at 100 mg /ml. When having to choose between Grape Seed or Coconut Oil soap, 94% of sow bugs sought refuge in linoleate-poor shelters. To demonstrate cross-genus effects, I tested the ability of these soaps to repel Japanese Beetles (Popillia japonica) feeding. Beetles consistently devoured water or coconut oil soap treated leaves while avoiding linoleate-rich Grape Seed oil soap treated food sources. Thus, it appears that sodium linoleate is a potent repellent of small invertebrates. This water-soluble soap should be further explored as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly pest repellent.

IN SEARCH OF THE CAUSATIVE GENETIC ELEMENT(S) AFFECTING ENTROPION EYELID DEVELOPMENT IN NEW-BORN LAMBS: IS IT OAR16_14874751?
Aerin Erika Towle
Sumner High School, Sumner, WA

Entropion is a heritable trait resulting in the inversion of the eyelid(s) which causes blindness if left uncorrected. Decreased herd productivity results from treating the defective eyes as well as culling the parental donors of Entropion exhibiting lambs. Previously, a whole genome association scan (WGAS) was performed including 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) distributed throughout the sheep genome. The WGAS identified a SNP (OAR16_14874751) located within a regulator of erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2IP) as a potential genetic contributor to the trait. For this study, genomic DNA from twenty Entropion scored sheep and 9 sheep negative for Entropion were used to sequence 1.5 kilobases (Kb) of DNA from sheep chromosome 16 on either side of OAR16_14874751, and additional SNPs (17) were identified that may be associated with Entropion eyelid. Statistical analysis included Fisher’s Exact Test to measure the p-value of association and the odds ratio for relative risk of contracting Entropion if the OAR16_14874751 SNP is present. A supplemental finding indicates that the Maternal Effect appears to be a contributor in the inheritance of Entropion phenotypes in lambs when the ewe is a carrier of a minor allele caused by the OAR16_14874751 SNP associated with Entropion and her fetal progeny are unable to produce the proteins necessary for eye development. The ewe’s progeny employ the mutated protein encoded by the minor allele associated with Entropion in eyelid development causing the demonstration of the Entropion phenotype without the presence of the Entropion genotype within the progeny of affected ewes.

Bernadette Ann Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

It is crucial to develop new antimicrobials to combat the burgeoning problem of drug-resistant pathogens, including Methicillin and Multiple-Resistant Staph aureus(MRSA), Multidrug-Resistant(MDR-TB) and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis(XDR-TB). Natural products provide sources of antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer drugs which are promising leads to fight resistant diseases.<br><br>This experiment examines extracts from 2 species of Gulf of Mexico Marine Sponges, Darwinella mulleri, Pink Sponge, and Dysidea camera, Blue Sponge. These compounds were previously shown to inhibit 3 pathogens: Staph aureus, Tuberculosis mimic Mycobacterium smegmatis, and fungal meningitis mimic Cryptococcus albidus, and were separated using column chromatography. The most bioactive fraction was selected for further testing.<br><br>The most bioactive compounds, Pink Sponge fraction 8, and Blue Sponge fraction 11, were separated into 7 subfractions using High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC). After peak analysis, used HPLC to more extensively separate sub-fractions into 73 fractions each to obtain single compounds. Selected 42 of 146 samples for further Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR) testing. Capillary NMR testing of 4 samples included 1H, COSY, HMBC, and HSQC to obtain characteristic structural data. Analysis will continue on samples using capillary NMR and Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry to formulate molecular structures and characterize the bioactive compounds.<br><br>These antimicrobials could potentially provide new leads for combating resistant pathogens such as MRSA, XDR-TB, and MDR-TB. Determining the molecular structure of these natural products from marine sponges using chemical analysis is crucial for the synthetic reproduction of the compounds and the conservation of sponge populations.

RETINAL PHOTOTRANSDUCTION PROTEIN DISTRIBUTION IN VENTRAL VS. DORSAL HEMIRETINA OF THE PANTODON BUCHHOLZI
Sanjana Salwi
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

This experiment aimed to understand the distribution of phototransduction proteins in the retina of the Pantodon. The Pantodon buchholzi is a surface fish with a rare tripartite visual field: the ventral hemiretina views into the air while the dorsal hemiretina views into the water. Thus, the Pantodon eye presents a unique system to investigate the relationship between aquatic Vs aerial halves of a single fish retina and explore its relationship to the vertebrate aerial retina. The hypothesis was: the structural and molecular organization of the aerial and aquatic halves of the Pantodon retina is different. However, the aerial half of the Pantodon retina may resemble a fully aerial vertebrate retina (cow eye was chosen as the model system) more than the aquatic half. To examine the proteins, immunostaining with a primary antibody and then a secondary fluorescent-tagged antibody was used on cyroprotected sections of the Pantodon retina. Then, immunoreactive proteins were detected under a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope. The presence of several proteins known to be involved in the vertebrate (bovine) retinal signal transduction process were tested in the Pantodon retina and the relative distribution between the ventral Vs dorsal retina was examined. Positive staining for obtained for the following antigens: rod outer segment guanylate cyclase type 1 (ROSGC1) and S100B. Structural differences were observed between the two halves. <br><br>Positive staining indicated that the aerial and aquatic halves of the Pantodon retina are structurally different yet use similar distribution of signaling pathways that are very different from that of the vertebrate (bovine) aerial retina.

COMPARISON OF THE NERVOUS FUNCTION AND DISCRIMINATION CAPACITY FOR CERTAIN SHAPES AND COLORS BETWEEN AURELIA AURITA (MOON JELLYFISH) AND HOLOTHURIA MEXICANA (SEA CUCUMBER)
Adolfo Rodriguez-Velazquez
Florencia Garcia High School, Las Piedras, PUERTO RICO

In previous investigations it was concluded that Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) uses the rhopalium, a structure related to their nervous function in the discrimination of certain shapes and colors. In this research, the problem was: Are there similarities between the discrimination capacity for certain shapes and colors related to the nervous systems of Aurelia aurita and of Holothuria mexicana (sea cucumber)?. The hypothesis was: The nervous system of Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) and Holothuria mexicana (sea cucumber) have similarities in their discrimination capacity for certain shapes and colors. <br><br>A water tank was built to put the sea cucumbers. It was divided into three different sections that were covered with white, black and green plastics. Each section was divided into three subsections in which there were obstacles placed vertically and horizontally. Twenty three sea cucumbers were captured and freed inside the water tank. The organisms were observed eight times daily during day and night for fifteen days. It was observed that sea cucumbers evaded the obstacles in the water tank. Based on the behavior of sea cucumbers the oral tentacles are related to the discrimination of shapes and colors. The dissection of the two preserved organisms evidenced that the oral tentacles were well developed. <br><br>Comparisons between both investigations led to conclude that the hypothesis was true. Cucumbers and jellyfish have parts which comply with the discrimination for colors and shapes. In jellyfish is the rhopalium and in sea cucumbers are their oral tentacles, both connected to a series of nerve channels.

POPULATION CENSUS OF LAND MOLLUSKS IN A XEROPHYTIC FOREST ECOSYSTEM: THE GUANICA STATE FOREST IN PUERTO RICO
Veronica Nieves
Asuncion Rodriguez de Sala, Guayanilla, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research was to investigate the xerophytic forest ecosystem in terms of species diversity, population density, abundance index of land mollusks found at different heights on the trees and factors that alter its multiplication. The hypothesis was: The factors that alter the multiplication of land mollusks are: weather, high temperatures, low humidity, topography and soil chemical composition. In order to carry out this study a 10 m2 area was used. Thirty-two trees were identified, represented by nine families and ten tree species. In the superior stratum: Deciduous Forest, the abundance index was twenty-two snails from two species. Factors that contribute were: withered leaves and tree roots. Intermediate stratum: Mahogany Plantation abundance index was seven snails from two species. Factors that affected were: high topography, steep ground levels and fine lime ground. Low stratum: Thorn Bush, abundance index sixty one snails in two species. The hypothesis was proven. The factors that benefit the multiplication of land mollusks in the physical geography of the low stratum are weather: accumulated rainfall, high temperatures and topography, with a lot of limestone, that allow accumulation of water and humidity. The soil composition is sedimentary rock and it receives the runoff from the higher zones. There is organic material on the ground, varieties of small plants and trees that are separated. The area near the Caribbean Sea receives the effect of the energy of the shocking waves and the saltpeter that comes with the wind contribute to the humidity of the zone.

THE RELATION BETWEEN MU OPIOIDS RECEPTORS AND DRUG-ADDITION
Yelitza Angelica Rodriguez
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

This investigation is based on a previous experiment conducted by a doctor in the laboratory where this research was done. The purpose of this research was to analyze the photographs of the rats’ brain slices in Dorsal Striatum in order to study the relation between Mu opioid receptors and addiction. What is the effect of cocaine on the concentration of Mu opioid receptors in the Dorsal Striatum in female rats under the effects of Naloxone? The hypothesis was that the concentration of Mu-opioid receptors will be higher in OVX-EB rats that received one injection of cocaine. Since the mechanisms that regulate the rats’ response to cocaine is not known, optical densities were taken in the Dorsal Striatum to analyze the density of Mu opioid receptors. The density of the radioimmunoassays was measured using the MCID Elite. The photographs were analyzed using a computer and computer software for image analysis of densitometry. Densitometry results evidenced that the concentration of Mu-opioid receptors significantly increased in OVX-EB rats. <br><br>The experiment revealed that when women with drug-addition problems are treated with: Buprenorphine, Naloxone, Methadone or other opioid receptor antagonist there will be a significant increase in Mu receptors, when it is supposed to be the opposite. Therefore the hypothesis was accepted. Drug-addiction researchers must pay attention to gender and menstrual cycle, because estrogen can inhibit the effectiveness of drug treatment. These results indicate that it is necessary to review clinical protocols for the treatment of women with drug-addictions.

USING ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING TO PREDICT CURRENT AND FUTURE RANGES OF CRYPTIC PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC LINEAGES
Helen Yao
Staten Island Technical High School, Staten Island, NY

Cryptic species are independently evolving lineages that are classified as the same species due to morphological similarities. Sky island conditions facilitate cryptic speciation, as sky islands are mountains isolated by valleys of differing environmental conditions. Such isolation also makes these species especially susceptible to climate change. For the sake of biodiversity and conservation, it is essential to discover cryptic speciation; undescribed species cannot be conserved. Lampropeltis pyromelana is a sky island snake found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The purpose of this study was to determine possible cryptic speciation and potential habitat for L. pyromelana. Forty-five tissue samples from L. pyromelana were obtained and analyzed for genetic differences. Using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood, it was found that L. pyromelana is comprised of two well-supported clades. Further analysis using Bayesian species delimitation revealed that these clades are distinct species. Ecological niche modeling based on environmental variables such as precipitation and temperature was used to assess the potential range for L. pyromelana and its two lineages. It was found that the two lineages occupy different niches in the U.S. and Mexico and that these two lineages may experience a contraction in potential range by 2050. This result indicates that in the future, L. pyromelana may merit protection and supports the idea that sky island species may be especially vulnerable to climate change.

THE TERRITORIAL ROAMING PATTERNS OF FELIS CATUS (THE DOMESTIC CAT)
Savannah Joy Tobin
West Salem High School, Salem, OR

The purpose of this study is to use GPS wildlife tracking techniques to map the territorial wanderings of the domesticated feline (Felis catus). This study documents and compares their home ranges to cats of the (Panthera) classification. Additionally, correlations were made comparing their male to female home range size ratios. Using a GPS system designed specifically for (Felis catus), a total of eight cats, four males, and four females were tracked on multiple days. The GPS coordinates were processed through a program called Home Ranger which was used to calculate the probable location of a cat at any given time. Home range data (95% fixed kernel estimates; mean ± SD) indicates that male cat home ranges are 1.5 times larger in area than female ranges. Home ranges collected were (n= 5 home ranges of 4 males; 3.00ha ± 2.40ha) and (n= 5 home ranges of 4 females; 2.02ha ± 1.00ha). While females stick close to the barn at the center of their territory, males take long journeys in irregular star shaped patterns. The domestic cats average daily home range is 2.39 ha ± 1.77ha. To the author’s knowledge, this is one of the only known studies in the United States to record domestic cat home ranges.

DAIRY FARMERS DREAM III
Matthew Joseph Schaefbauer
Strasburg Public School, Strasburg, ND

With today’s economy, dairy farmers have a tough time trying to keep up with their quality management. When the cost to operate a dairy is more than the cost to maintain good quality, farmers are forced to lessen the amount of input they will provide for the cows to get that good quality. The quality of milk effects not only the producers, but the consumers as well. It effects the consumer in means of the taste and shelf life of the product. This is a problem that every consumer and producer has at some point, however certain simple procedures can be taken to help improve these conditions. Evidence from the data I collected shows that there are patterns in a cow’s lactation which can be used to our advantage. The common procedure for consumers to maintain good quality is simple. The most effective way to increase milk quality when it comes to shelf life and somatic cell is by keeping the cows environment clean. As for other milk components, the most effective way to get better taste in products such as cheese and yogurt is by increasing the cows butterfat and controlling all of the other milk components at a steadier rate. However, based on my results from this years project there are even more ways to control milk components effectively than what results have shown in the past. I found that by using California Mastitis Tests and dividing a cows lactation in half the consumer will be able to advance the production of good quality milk. However all of the cows conditions must be clean in order to keep infections such as mastitis in control. If the cows environment is not clean then stripping out the cows will still have a great effect, but stripping out the cows will not prevent mastitis and it will not be applicable.

THE EFFECT OF HEATED AND UNHEATED ASPARTAME ON VANESSA CARDUI GROWTH AND SURVIVORSHIP
Irene Zhen Peaks
Bend Science Station, Bend, OR

Aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener that has been shown to cause negative health effects. Last year, I conducted a study on the effect of sugar and sugar substitutes on Vanessa cardui growth and metamorphosis. In this experiment, I showed that the aspartame heated to 100°C caused 100% mortality in caterpillars. This year, I tested the hypothesis that aspartame heated to temperatures between 20-100°C would negatively affect caterpillar growth rate and survivorship. I had three treatments, aspartame, sucrose (table sugar), and control (no sugar). Each treatment had four temperature preparations, 20ºC, 37ºC, 67ºC and 100ºC. The four cups in each temperature condition were mixed individually to decrease the possibility of caterpillar death due to food preparation errors. After hatching, caterpillar survivorship and growth were monitored by weekly counts and weighing. My study demonstrated that aspartame heated to 100ºC stunted growth and was lethal to the caterpillars with none of the 140 eggs surviving to adulthood. The survivorship in the other three aspartame conditions (20ºC, 37ºC and 67ºC) was only slightly better with seven out of 420 eggs (1.7%) actually surviving to become butterflies. In addition, the caterpillars in every aspartame treatment grew significantly slower than the control and the sucrose treatments (single factor ANOVA, p-values < 0.0069). Conversely, the survivorship of sucrose caterpillars was higher than the controls at every temperature and their average mass after 32 days was significantly higher than the controls in the 37°C, 67°C and 100 °C treatments (single factor ANOVA, p-values < 0.0012).

DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF WILD AND CAPTIVE-BRED TENODERA SINENSIS
Cameron Michael Jones
Northwest Career and Technical Academy, Las Vegas, NV

The order of Mantodea has been the subject of various studies. Most studies of the praying mantis have been done in captivity under the watchful eye of scientists. However, many findings describing praying mantis behavior and development conflicted with how mantids supposedly thrived in the wild. Thus, new experiments were designed to relieve the insects from the stress of the laboratory conditions, leading to new findings. In this experiment, I attempt to analyze the development and behavior of captive bred T. sinensis and compare them to the development and behavior of wild T. sinensis. The information regarding praying mantis ecology and the basis of an ecosystem will be used to construct a self-sustained ecosystem in order to avoid the issue of documenting wild nymphs. This ecosystem will serve as the natural environment T. sinensis is accustomed to. My methods for conducting this experiment consist of three sections: Setting up the ecosystem, preparing the control group, and Breeding the control group. In order to set up the ecosystem, both abiotic and biotic components were introduced in a container to simulate a true ecosystem. The behaviors and development of the “wild” specimens in the ecosystem were compared to those in captivity. This study shows that the wild group of Tenodera sinensis developed faster than the captive group and suggests a possible relationship between sexual cannibalism and captivity. Finally, the results show that there is no relationship between the male length and weight or the female weight, though one exists between female lengths.

GLIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPING IN THE DROSOPHILA BRAIN
Chengzhen Li Dai
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

In the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila, ~150 neurons are known to control the circadian clock. The circadian clock is mainly regulated by the clock genes: period (per), timeless (tim), clock (clk), and cycle (cyc). Previous studies have revealed that glia, like neurons, also express PER in an oscillating manner, suggesting that glia may help regulate circadian rhythm. However, little is known about the exact role of glia in circadian timekeeping. Thus, this study seeks to determine how glial cells contribute to circadian timekeeping. Behavioral experiments were performed to determine whether glial cells are necessary in timekeeping, whether glial cells can regulate the length of the circadian period and finally, whether glial cells alone are capable to reestablishing rhythmic behavior in arrhythmic flies. Behavioral analyses of flies under constant darkness reveal that knockdown of PER in glia does affect rhythmic locomotors activity as the majority of flies were arrhythmic. Furthermore, the analyses indicated that glial cells alone cannot speed up the clock, but neurons alone also cannot speed up the clock. This suggests that neuron-glia interactions must occur in order to regulate the clock. Lastly, the expression of PER exclusively in the glia of arrhythmic flies does not rescue rhythmic behavior. This result suggests that neurons are necessary in timekeeping as glial cells alone are not capable of establishing a rhythm. In conclusion, while glia cells are not necessary for flies to be rhythmic, they are necessary for stability of a circadian rhythm and the regulation of the clock.

THE EFFECTS OF THREE FACTORS OF TARGET PREY ON FIELD EFFICACY OF A NATIVE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT, ANISOPS TAHITIENSIS, AGAINST AEDES POLYNESIENSIS, THE MAJOR DENGUE AND FILARIASIS VECTOR IN AMERICAN SAMOA
Faalolo'i Te'o
Tafuna High School, Tafuna, AMERICAN SAMOA

The backswimmer Anisops tahitiensis is a naturally occurring predator of aquatic invertebrates in American Samoa. This study evaluated its efficacy in the field as a biological control agent against Aedes polynesiensis Marks, which is a major vector of filariasis and dengue in the Pacific region. A factorial design was used to evaluate the effects of habitat, developmental stage of the target prey, and presence of alternative prey on the predation of Ae. polynesiensis larvae by Anisops tahitiensis The backswimmers consumed slightly more mosquito larvae in the ice cream containers habitat than in tires, but the difference was significant only with second instar Ae. polynesiensis when alternative prey were not present. More mosquito larvae were eaten when the alternative prey, ostracods, were absent than when ostracods were present, but the difference was significant only with second instar mosquitoes in ice cream containers and fourth instars in tires. In all cases the predation rate was significantly higher on second instar mosquito larvae than on fourth instar mosquito larvae. The backswimmers consumed more ostracods than mosquitoes when both were present, but the difference was significant only in the tires habitat with fourth instar mosquito larvae. The results of this study show how effective these predators are, under field conditions, in larval habitats utilized by Ae. polynesiensis, against two prey stages which occur there, and under different conditions of alternative prey availability.

OYSTER RESTORATION, PART II
Gabriella Dora Quintana
Friendswood High School, Friendswood, TX

Oyster Restoration Part II is a project to study faster and more efficient ways to cultivate oysters so that the reefs destroyed by natural and manmade disasters can be restored and repopulated with oysters. Oysters play a vital role ecologically, environmentallly, and economically. Natural and manmade disasters have had a devastating effect on the oyster population along the Texas Louisiana coastline. Hypothesis 1: If oyster bags with adult live oysters and bags with just oyster shells ar hung, then oyster bags with adult live oysters will attract more "spat", baby oyster. Hypothese 2:One-fourth oyster bags will be cleared of predators once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, and not till end of project. The bags cleared once a month will yield the highest "spat" count. <br><br>A sample size of 64 bags were hung, 32 at each site. there were four levels of disturbance (every week, every 2 weeks, once a month, and then the last one-fourth not pulled till the end of the project. the bags at Sabine Pass yielded greater numbers of spats (602) vs. San Leon with (19 spats). The bags at San Leon had greater numbers of predators which along with low water movement could possibly have contributed to the low spat count. Spat growth at Sabine Pass was facilitated by the high volume of ships passing which caused water flow throughout the 2 month project. Sources of error were, possible incomplete collection of predators when bags were pulled, data not collected from bags that were lost, and randomization whoudl have worked to 4 samples of each kind.<br><br>Future studies should be done replicating the methods an dprocedures with a larger sample size near the mouth of a river at two to three different sites to determine if the data could duplicated to that of Sabine Pass

A PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY ON HEART HEALTHY SUPPLEMENTS AND THE HEART RATE OF DAPHNIA MAGNA
Marie Eleanor Reuter
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL

This project demonstrated a relationship between heart healthy vitamins and heart rate. If Daphnia magna are administered a human equivalent dosage of heart healthy supplements for a specified period of time a corresponding decrease in the specimen’s heart rate should be noted. This experiment required multiple mathematical computations. Of those calculations, deriving a human equivalent supplement dosage for administration to Daphnia magna for six vitamin combinations was required. This was accomplished by finding a correlation of average human male and female weights to average Daphnia magna weights. From this data an equivalent supplement dosage for Daphnia was subsequently calculated. Six supplements were tested on five groups of Daphnia magna each. Each group was tested for 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-minute intervals. Data results revealed a corresponding decrease in heart rate for each supplement series tested with the exception of super-B complex. The average Daphnia magna heart rate was 252 bpm. When administered Flaxseed Oil heart rate plunged to 161.52 bpm, Magnesium decreased to 164.68 bpm, Coenzyme Q10 dropped to 169 bpm, Fish Oil dipped to 181.88 bpm, Multi-Vitamin Complete slight drop to 244.32 bpm, and Super-B Complex an increase to 283.64 bpm. Daphnia magna were reintroduced to clean spring water and in each instance heart rates increased back to control group levels. In conclusion, vitamin mixtures lowered Daphnia magna heart rate with the exception of super B complex. It is probable a person wishing to control heart rate could do so through a similar inexpensive vitamin regiment.

HOW DOES TAURINE AFFECT THE HEART DEVELOPMENT OF CHICK EMBRYOS?
Brooklynn Fayth Carney
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how taurine affected the heart rate and development of chick embryos. My hypothesis is that the taurine will increase the rate of the embryos heart development. First I randomly assigned the fertilized eggs to seven different groups. Four of these groups served as controls and either did not receive treatment or received ringer's solution. Two had taurine or 5 hour energy drops; and one was injected with 0.1 ml of 17.4 mg/ml of taurine. The eggs were incubated at 37.8 degrees Celsius. The embryos with taurine, ringer's, or 5 hour energy drops were incubated for 36 hours before they were tested, and the injected eggs were incubated for 48 hours prior to injection, then incubated for 9 days. Then the embryos were removed and staged according to Hamburger-Hamilton protocol. The data collected for the injection experiment was analyzed using simple linear regression. The eggs in the 5 hour energy treatment showed an arrhythmia faster than the taurine and the control groups did not develop an arrhythmia. The taurine injected embryos showed no significant difference than controls. In conclusion, no significant results could be drawn from the injected eggs, while the 5 hour energy did increase the heart rate more than the taurine or control treatments.

THE EFFECT OF SUBLETHAL DOSES OF OXALIC ACID ON THE LIFESPAN OF HONEYBEES
Colby Lee Howell
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate that the organic and commercial treatment of varroa mite populations with oxalic acid has minimal effect on the short-term lifespan of honeybees, with or without vitamin supplementation. Based upon prior research, oxalic acid is known to effectively treat and prevent varroa mites from propagating, but little is known about the effect oxalic acid has on honeybees. The hypothesis was that oxalic acid would have little to no effect on the lifespan of honeybees. Support of the hypothesis was determined by using 18 bee cages, with approximately 100 bees per cage. Bees were exposed to either 100 or 200 microliters of oxalic acid with and without vitamin supplementation. The results collected during this project demonstrated that oxalic acid with vitamin supplementation did not affect the lifespan of honeybees. After recording the number of dead bees for sixteen days, an ANOVA determined the data as statistically insignificant. However, there are sources of error. Only one trial was conducted and all of the bees were accidentally starved for one week because of a solution miscalculation, resulting in above average mortality rates, which may have skewed the data. Overall, the results demonstrate that the hypothesis was supported. To further understand this topic, finding the correct dosage, form of dosage, long and short-term side effects, and toxicity of oxalic acid is required. This will determine whether or not the marginal benefits of chemically treating bees outweigh the marginal costs of treating bees at all.

EFFECTS OF FOOD TYPES ON SURVIVAL AND DEVELOPMENT OF LARVAL CALIFORNIA SPINY LOBSTERS, PANULIRUS INTERRUPTUS
Adrienne Brooke McColl
San Pedro High School, San Pedro, CA

This project was conducted to determine how diet affects the survival of California spiny lobster phyllosoma larvae, Panulirus interruptus, a species that has never been successfully raised before. 50 phyllosoma larvae were used, with 10 phyllosoma in each condition. The following five diets were used: 1) brine shrimp ONLY (control), 2) mussel gonadal tissue, grunion eggs, and brine shrimp, 3) larval grunion and brine shrimp, 4) copepods, rotifers, and brine shrimp, and 5) mussel gonads, grunion eggs, larval grunion, copepods, rotifers, and brine shrimp. Each phyllosoma was housed in an individual closed-system 1000mL tank and fed its assigned diet daily. When a phyllosoma died, measurements and photographs were taken to show growth and morphological development. The project lasted for 179 days, until the last phyllosoma died. Results have shown that phyllosoma from diets 1 and 3 had the highest survivorship. In addition, phyllosoma from diet 3 reached the furthest metamorphic stage and achieved the greatest size. <br><br>This study has applications for aquaculture, in both research and commercial settings. By culturing marine species for human use, the impact on wild stocks is decreased. Like many marine species, the California spiny lobster fishery has been declining since the 1970s. Considering this and their extremely high economic value, California spiny lobsters are an excellent candidate for aquaculture.

THE EFFECT OF THE RHOPALIA ON THE REGENERATION AND OVERALL HEALTH OF THE AURELIA AURITA, YEAR 2
Manu Vaish
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

The purpose of my project is to determine whether the removal of the rhopalia of the Aurelia Aurita affects or even controls the organism’s regeneration and overall health. The hypothesis of the project was that when a certain rhopalia was removed the jelly would cease to function properly. <br><br> In order to do this project, two adult medusas and six ephyra were obtained. Then using a pair of fine knives and a microscope an incision was made to remove two adjacent rhopalia. Once the jelly or ehphyra regenerated one or two of its original rhopalia, the next two were cut out until it exhibited abnormal behavior.<br><br> The results garnered from this experiment were that in all of the medusa jellies removal of the rhopalia resulted in either death or horrible regeneration. In all cases at least one of the rhopalia did not come back and the bell reformed all the way past the original point of cut. The ehphyra all died within the first cuts mostly; however, one ehphyra managed to survive and regenerate all of its rhopalia. Two times out of six the ehphyra lost the arms that the rhopalia were removed from. <br><br> The conclusions drawn from this project are that removing a rhopalia definitely affects the organism. Whether there is one rhopalia or multiple rhopalia controlling the rhopalia is still up for question; however, in the end the rhopalia truly has a massive impact on the organism from ehphyra to medusa stages.

IMPROVING INCOMPATIBLE INSECT TECHNIQUE USING A PHEROMONE-LIKE SEMIOCHEMICAL IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE A NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASE VECTOR
Tamas Nagy
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is one of the primary causes of severe disability in the Southern Pacific with >96% of the population at risk for infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently invested in a mass-drug administration (MDA) strategy to eliminate LF. Despite successful elimination of LF in many geographical areas, this method is failing in the South Pacific due to the complexity and uniqueness of the region’s primary vector, Aedes polynesiensis. Wolbachia, a maternally-inherited, obligate, intracellular bacterium has generated much interest recently because of its potential use through the sterile/incompatible insect techniques (SIT/IIT). It causes developmental arrest when two mosquitoes of incompatible strains of Wolbachia mate due to a phenomenon known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. However, current attempts to suppress vector populations in American Samoa and French Polynesia are encountering issues with rearing enough bidirectionally incompatible male mosquitoes (10% of target releases). Here we report that conspecific, i.e. intraspecific, pollution is beneficial, with increases in larval development rate and larval survival, to a Wolbachia-infected strain of A. polynesiensis (CP22). Also we demonstrate that the agent responsible is not microbial, that the larval conditioned water (LCW) contains <1.25 µg/mL peptides, and that the active agent in the LCW is most likely not peptic in origin. N-tetracosane has been identified via GC/MS against a hydrocarbon standard as a potential pheromone-like semiochemical contained within the LCW. This research has identified a potential candidate for use in mass rearing, necessary for IIT, which could help eliminate this neglected tropical disease.

INCIPIENT SPECIATION OF THE MUSTACHED BAT PTERONOTUS PARNELLII IN THE WEST INDIES
Bonnie Lei
Walnut High School, Walnut, CA

Populations of mustached bat Pteronotus parnellii on Hispaniola (H), Puerto Rico (PR), and geographic intermediate Isla Mona (IM) were studied through molecular, morphological, and echolocation analyses to determine the species’ population structure in the West Indies.<br><br>Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b sequences indicate H and PR P. parnellii group in largely exclusive clades while IM bats are genetically similar to PR P. parnellii. Fixed pairwise differences indicate high and significant separation values between H and PR as well as between H and IM. There is no significant difference between PR and IM and migration occurs mainly from PR to IM, much less so from H to IM. All other inter-island gene flow was negligible.<br><br>Comparisons using ANOVA showed that H P. parnellii is significantly smaller and lighter, with smaller forearms and feet but longer tails than PR bats. IM bats are morphologically similar to either H or IM, depending on the measurement. H bats emit a significantly higher frequency than PR/IM in the constant frequency portion of their echolocation call, corroborating the genetic data. <br><br>The results support classification of H P. parnellii population and the PR/IM population as separate species. Inter-island range expansion during the Wisconsinan glaciation followed by interglacial isolation is a possible incipient speciation mechanism. Determining this speciation event doubles the number of endemic species in Hispaniola, indicating the additional importance of conserving these species to maintain the full genetic diversity and population robustness of bats in the West Indies.

MELTING POT? OR NOT? ANALYSIS OF THE VALIDITY OF THE HARDY-WEINBERG EQUILIBRIUM IN THE LOCAL POPULATION
Dalton Klain Brossett, Destin Stratton, 
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

One of the major areas researched in current times is DNA manipulation. The purpose was to analyze the validity of the Hardy-Weinberg Theory by studying the allele and genotypic frequencies for the local population utilizing the Alu insert in the PV 92 locus. Our hypothesis was that the Alu repeat appears in the general population at random and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will not be in agreement with the local population since the population must have no migration of individuals into or out of the population. We started by collecting two hairs containing the follicles from each participant. Samples were then processed to obtain geneomic DNA and then a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the DNA samples. The amplified samples were then electrophoresed with agarose gels and stained with Fast Blast DNA stain so that the bands could be visualized. Results were recorded with the allelic frequencies observed for homozygous +/+ 0.04; homozygous -/- 0.21; heterozygous +/- 0.75. The expected results according to the Hardy-Weinberg Theory would be for homozygous +/+ 0.02; homozygous -/- 0.24; heterozygous +/- 0.73. The results for this project proved our hypothesis corrrect; that our local population was out of equilibrium compared to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

STUDYING TRUE BUGS METAMORPHOSIS: THE LIFE CYCLE OF DITOMOTARSUS PUNCTIVENTRIS SPINOLA, 1852
Mariom Adriana Carvajal Morales, Giannina Andrea Osorio Bahamonde, 
Liceo Maria Auxiliadora, Punta Arenas, Magallanes Region, CHILE

During a field trip (53º55’S-70º53’W Magallanes, Chile) we found a big aggregation of true bugs (Heteroptera) in reproduction time, and we asked: How the biological cycle of this species is. We consulted to a specialist, he confirmed our identification (Ditomotarsus punctiventris: Acanthosomatidae), and we began our research. Our hypothesis was: Ditomotarsus punctiventris has an annual cycle, in which passes through five immature stages, as it is known in other species of its family. Subsequently we collected and observed specimens in field, and maintained breedings in laboratory. We consulted different specialists to obtain bibliography and help on answering our questions.<br><br>Through breedings we obtained the following cycle: After mating female oviposits 1 to 4 batches of about 14 eggs (eggs could have golden or light green coloration). From the egg an immature stage emerge (nymph), which passes for five instars until the adult emerges. Coloration changes have been observed for adults (brown to green). Additionally we developed identification keys to life stages of D. punctiventris, and for the nymphs of Magallanes Acanthosomatidae.<br><br>Our hypothesis was accepted. Coloration changes have been concluded as camouflage strategy. These changes were also concluded as useful in climatic change studies. Nymphs were concluded to be present in spring-summer, because they need more favourable conditions than adults for their development. D. punctiventris was concluded as a species of economic importance; thus our work has also applications on pest management. The description of oviposition process, nymphal stages, coloration changes, and the identifications keys developed are new scientific information.

THE PRODUCTION CHARACTERISTICS OF MALE AND FEMALE FRESHWATER PRAWNS GROWN IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA
Kevin Charles Wise, Eric Lyndon Gardiner, 
Saint Joseph High School, Greenville, MS

Little is known about the production characteristics of Freshwater Prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in temperate regions of the United States. We conducted research to test five hypotheses related to the effects of gender and morphology on production characteristics of Freshwater Prawns in the Mississippi Delta. We sampled prawns from six grow-out ponds to determine proportional yield at harvest. Male prawns averaged greater body lengths, total mass and tail mass than females, but females consistently had a higher proportional yield. Proportional yield of males dropped substantially as they developed blue claws, but yield of females remained level for all body masses. Egg masses increased proportional yield of females. These results should assist growers with understanding production characteristics of Freshwater Prawns in the Mississippi Delta.

BIRDS OF THE SANTA CRUZ SANDHILLS
Alexander Michael Rinkert, Connor Chesus, 
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA

The Santa Cruz Sandhills is a rare and unique habitat found only in central Santa Cruz County, California. There are two distinct communities that make up the habitat: Sand Chaparral and Sand Parkland which comprise of less than 4,000 acres of Sandhills habitat. These two communities are home to many endemic organisms that are adapted to the climate the habitat makes. Because of this uniqueness and rarity, the Santa Cruz Sandhills has been a topic of study in many different areas of science. However, one area lacks considerably: birds and avian ecology. Very little information is known about the birds of the Sandhills. It has been loosely proposed that their presence is influenced by the adjacent habitats, mixed evergreen and Coastal Redwood forest, but no study has been preformed to confirm or deny this. This led us to ask “What are the ‘birds of the Santa Cruz Sandhills’, and do they form an independent community within this habitat?” In September 2010, we began monitoring three Sandhills sites (one each of Sand Parkland, Sand Chaparral, and a site of mixed communities) to determine if the distribution of birds seen within the Sandhills was influenced by their adjacent habitats. Through a process of monitoring three times a week in area count form, we were able to determine what and how many birds are in each community of the Sandhills, and then compare that to the adjacent habitats to see if there is any similarity between avian life.

THE OBSERVATION OF THE BREEDING AND MATING HABITS OF MICE ACCORDING TO THE FOODS THEY CONSUME
Jazmin Ariel Acebedo Nicolas, Caelyn Udani, 
James Campbell High School, Ewa Beach, HI

Our project was performed by having two separate pairs of mice and putting each pair on a strict diet, after the allowed time for the mice to adjust to their diet, they were placed together into a mating cage where we observed their interaction towards each-other. <br><br>The experiment started with first adjusting all the mice to their specific diets and allowing their body enough time to react and correspond with the new nutrients they were consuming. Once that time period had elapsed the mice of the same experimental group were placed into their corresponding mating cages that were equipped with their specific diet.The mice were only allowed in their mating cages for two hours everyday until there was sign of sexual activity between the mice. Once sexual activity occurred between the mice, they were immediately separated and returned into their individual cages. After a few weeks the female mice from both experimental groups had given birth to their litter and the second half of the data was collected. <br><br>To ensure that the experiment was controlled during the time period, we made sure to control all the other variables that may in-fact have a positive/negative affect on the experiment; such as cleaning the cages every day, having the same amount of water/food in each mice cage, and allowing the mice to only be in the same cage for a specific amount of time.

THE MECHANISM OF LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID-INDUCED PROCOAGULATION IN HUMAN ERYTHROCYTES
Junha Park, Ji Hun An, 
Korea Science Academy of KAIST, Busan, SOUTH KOREA

Erythrocytes transfer oxygen in the circulatory system, but recent studies have suggested that they can also participate in coagulation by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and microvesicle (MV)generation. However, there have been no reports of a detailed and assured mechanism how intrinsic substances causes these effects. We investigated the effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator that is released from activated platelets, as a potential endogenous procoagulant. It has been only known that intracellular Ca2+ levels and PS exposure can be induced by LPA. We examined whether PS exposure and MV generation in human erythrocytes can be induced by LPA, and measured the changes in intracellular Ca2+ and ATP levels. To<br><br>elucidate the detailed novel mechanism of PS exposure of erythrocytes mediated by LPA, we applied the idea of membrane phospholipid translocases: scramblase and flippase, controlled by Ca2+ and ATP respectively. We measured the activities of membrane phospholipid translocases, and we successfully investigated their underlying mechanisms according to the results. We also<br><br>identified the physiological and pathological significance of LPA by observing the procoagulant activity of PS-exposed erythrocytes and adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelial cells. Finally, we verified the results under in vivo condition using rat thrombosis model. The results<br><br>suggest that this new insight could facilitate the prevention and treatment of thrombosis by offering possibility to control specific steps shown in the mechanism.

STUDY OF FOOD RELATIONS OF CAVE INVERTEBRATES
Ondrej Vosta
Anglo-Czech High School, Czech Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC

Feeding preferences of cave invertebrates have been studied by several methods. A cave ecosystem serves as a suitable model of environment for studying decomposition processes crucial in the soil, because the ecological interactions in a cave are more simple than the interactions in the soil. Studying the process of decomposition is one of the most important aims of soil biology.<br><br>Several species of cave springtails have been chosen for the study. The activity of three enzymes important for digestion (trehalase, celulase, chitinase) have been examined. It has been found out that springtails contain all tested enzymes which indicates that they can digest storage sugars and sugars included in cell walls of plants and fungi. Furthermore, two types of feeding preference tests have been carried out. Springtails were offered 16 species of fungi, 7 species of algae, and 1 cyanobacterium species. The most preferred alga was Chlamydomonas sp. and the most preferred fungus was Cladosporium herbarum.<br><br>Following methods have been tested methodically. A microscopic analysis of excrements under a normal and fluorescence microscope can tell us clearly what food was really consumed and digested. Another method is based on the detection of food marked by fluorescent staining in guts of living animals under ultraviolet light. <br><br>It has been found out that springtails prefer several cave microorganism species which are easily consumed and digested. A combination of more methods is the best way to understand the feeding biology of cave invertebrates. Applicability of epifluorescent and fluorescent marking to these study purposes has been verified successfully.

THE EFFECTS OF CHEMOSENSORY ON THE NUTRITIONAL BEHAVIOR OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Tori Erica Graf
Hillsboro High School, Hillsboro, OR

This project studies the ability of Caenorthabditis elegans (C. elegans), a microscopic nematode worm, to use chemosensory to detect the presence of a food source. C. elegans typically detect E. coli, their energy source, by using mechanoreceptor neurons. Research was done to see if C. elegans react to autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a chemical released by large populations of E. coli. AI-2 was placed in the C. elegans environment. Reaction time and population counts were recorded and compared to data from tests where E. coli was placed in the environment, instead of AI- 2. An Unpaired T-test found a significant difference between the C. Elegans' reaction to AI-2 and E. coli. C. elegans do not use chemosensory to detect the presence of bacteria. This conclusion could lead to studies of the genetics of nerves relating to chemosensory and the digestive system.

DANAUS PLEXIPPUS' RESPONSE TO ANTI-HERBIVORY DEFENSES OF ASCLEPIAS CURASSAVICA
Kirsten Nicole Geiger
Martin County High School, Stuart, FL

The unique relationship between A. curassavica, Tropical Milkweed, and D. plexippus, the Monarch butterfly, has been a model system in which to study the reciprical dynamics between two coevolving species. When herbivory starts, signals of the attack trigger changes to anti-herbivore defenses and these changes are referred to as induced responses. A. curassavica's induced responses include: increase in cardenolide compound (i.e. animal toxins) concentration, latex production, leaf toughness, foliar trichome density, and nitrogen content. In my experiment, I studied the effect of simulated leaf herbivory, via hole punching, in terms of caterpillar weight(g) and days until pupation. I chose three plant treatments to test these two variables. Plants in Treatment 1 had no damage, those in Treatment 2 had 10% of each leaf removed, and those of Treatment 3 had 50% removed. Results from the ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference in the weight of caterpillars among the three treatments, specifically between the 0% and the 10% simulated herbivory, and between the 0% and the 50% simulated herbivory. Caterpillars on the 0% treatment were heavier than those on both of the simulated herbivory treatments. However, there was no statistically significant difference between 10% and 50% simulated herbivory treatments in terms of caterpillar weight. As for days until pupation, results from the ANOVA showed that there was no statistically significant difference among the three treatments. I propose that the amount of the induced responses is not proportional to the amount of herbivory, and that there is a weight threshold that must be met in order for the caterpillar to be capable of pupating. Thus, overall weight did not affect the duration of time spent as a caterpillar.

AN INVESTIGATION OF BRAIN LATERLIZATION AND INTELLIGENCE IN CONURES
Alexandra Kaye Badeaux
Catholic High School - New Iberia, New Iberia, LA

The purpose of this project is to investigate brain lateralization (foot preference and verbal abilities) and intelligence in conures. My hypotheses are that brain lateralization will be demonstrated via left foot preference. Additionally, foot preference will be an indication of intelligence, while the ability to mimic speech will not. Four subjects were used, each from a different species of conure. The first test was an object permanence test using a board with a hole drilled in it and a small wooden cover. The birds were scored based on their response time and actions. 25 trials were conducted along with 5 non-reward trials. The second test was a spatial, orientation test where the birds learned that food was always present on the right or left, which concluded when they achieved a 90% criterion. The third test probed their ability to learn that food was always present under a certain color. Once they reached 90%, they were moved to a new set of colors (one being a familiar color that was not rewarded previous). 2,480 presentations were conducted over the course of the study. Results were calculated using the subject’s overall performance and error rates. It was found that speaking birds performed better than non-speaking. Right foot dominant birds also performed better than left foot dominant birds. All subjects studied demonstrated brain lateralization. These results demonstrate that conures are more spatially oriented rather than feature oriented.

MYOSTATIN MARKER: EFFECTS ON CATTLE PERFORMANCE
Bailey Lynne McKay
Franklin Public Schools, Franklin, NE

Myostatin, or growth and differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) has been identified as the factor causing a phenotype known as double muscling. Double muscling increases meat yield and muscle size, decreases fat in the carcass and in the muscle. The double muscling phenotype is a heritable condition that primarily results from an increase in the number of muscle fibers rather than the enlargement of individual muscle fibers. It has been stated that cattle with the myostatin marker require a greater quantity of dietary crude protein as a result of increase rate of protein synthesis. The purpose was to determine how cattle with intermediate frequencies of the myostatin marker perform on tradition rations versus cattle without the myostatin maker. Steers with a variation of the GDF8 F94L myostatin marker were used. Cattle were fed a 13% crude protein concentration. Body mass, hip height and muscle scores were taken on weigh days. Hip height and ADG averages were comparable between groups, though not statically significant P≤.42 and P≤.75 respectively. The steers homozygous for myostatin proved to visibly show more muscle expression by recording a higher muscle score on average versus the control and steers heterozygous for myostatin but not statically significant P ≤ .24. Steers heterozygous for mysotatin had the heaviest body mass throughout the trial versus steers homozygous for myostatin as predicted. Future studies on how individual feed intakes affects ADG, weight and muscle scores would be beneficial.<br><br>

INVESTIGATION RHACODACTYLUS GECKO ADHESION USING COMPUTER IMAGE ANALYSIS
Holly Jeanne Flann
InTech Collegiate High School, North Logan, UT

Geckos have evolved one of the most versatile and effective adhesives known. They can run up a wall or across a ceiling because of their remarkable toes which are covered by microscopic hairs, called setae. The mechanism of dry adhesion involving the setae on the toes of geckos has been the focus of scientific study for over a century. The potentials for a fabricated gecko tape are almost limitless. The goal of this project was to determine the mechanism behind gecko adhesion, using computational image analysis to make data more accurate. I hypothesized that the force involved was either Van Der Waals Dispersion forces, or Capillary Attraction, Van Der Waals is more highly suggested. If the gecko was adhering using Capillary Attraction, it would better adhere to the hydrophilic surface than the hydrophobic surface. The surfaces reaction to water would not matter if the gecko stuck using Van Der Waals force. The geckos were placed onto vertical glass surfaces of varying properties and recorded climbing. The video was then fed through two object tracking programs; one that measured the amount the gecko was moving its limbs, and another that recognized and highlighted the gecko’s feet. After running all the trial videos through the computer tracking programs, no adherence preference was visible. This shows that Van der Waals was a more suggested mechanism, and hypothesis was proven correct. New knowledge about the remarkable adhesive ability of geckos will be instrumental in the pursuit of new and better inventions.

THE CONUNDRUM CONTINUES: A SECOND YEAR STUDY ON THE TERATOGENIC AND REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SYNTHETIC HORMONES ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Hannah Claire Pagels
Grove High School, Grove, OK

Scientific concern regarding the adverse effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment has been fueled by wildlife studies, laboratory experiments, and human experiences. Male feminization, reduced reproductive success, and other developmental problems have occurred in many invertebrate species, wild fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. <br><br> This study exposed Drosophila melanogaster to the synthetic hormones ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate, both known teratogenic agents and endocrine disrupting compounds. Five generations of continuous exposure in two concentrations (E=10mcg/L P=500mcg/L, and E=20mcg/L P=1000mcg/L) were compared to a control. A total of 12,228 flies were sexed and evaluated to determine whether the presence of synthetic hormones resulted in increased phenotypic abnormalities, examples of male feminization, reproductive disruptions and/or skewed male/female sex ratios. This study also evaluated the reproductive impact of teratogenically compromised Drosophila exposed to synthetic hormones for over 16 generations. Selected Drosophila were isolated and bred to determine if long term synthetic hormone exposure compromised reproduction. <br><br> The findings suggest that the presence of synthetic hormones does impact the male/female sex ratios demonstrating a significant adverse effect after four generations. Evidence of reproductive effects was found in the ability to reproduce and offspring numbers in teratogenically compromised Drosophila.

PROSTAGLADIN F2A INDUCING LUTEOLYSIS FOR REPRODUCTIVE ENHANCEMENTS IN THE CAPRA HIRCUS
Kaitlyn Margaret Wiley
Hicksville High School, Hicksville, OH

The experimental design was to test the hypothesis that the use of prostaglandin F2alpha to induce a timed and controlled luteolysis of the corpus luteum. Thus propagating a subsequent decline of serum progesterone levels resulting in ovulation and behavioral estrus will allow more accurate use and timing of advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination in the Capra hircus. <br><br> The purpose of the experiment is two fold. The first is to allow labor requirements to be focused in a finite timeframe. The second is by using this synchronization technique, enhanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination can be used to aid in world wide distribution of superior genomes from the worlds top sires. <br><br> The experimental design consisted of a test and a control group. Does were of similar age and were all reproductively sound animals in excellent health. Controlled variables included environment, feed intake, water intake, mineral intake and nutritional supplements. Standard animal husbandry practices were followed for the duration of the trial. Any animals not meeting the above criteria were excluded from this study. <br><br> The test animals were injected with 10mg of prostaglandin f2alpha which resulted in a mean time to behavioral estrus of 13.2 hours with a range of 11.5-14.25 hours. The mean time to behavioral estrus in controlled subjects was 259.2 hours with a range of 48-648 hours. The hypothesis was confirmed. The test group's estrous cycle were tightly synchronized when compared to the control group.

THE EFFECTS OF HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP AND MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE ON THE HEART RATE OF DAPHNIA MAGNA
Margaret Donovan Doyle
Yorktown High School, Arlington, VA

Heart rates of over 120 Daphnia magna were counted three times each: before, during and after exposure to one of six concentrations (10 %, 5 %, 2.5 %, 1.25 %, 0.625 %, and 0.3125 % weight/volume) of high fructose corn syrup(HFCS)solutions, monosodium glutamate (MSG)solutions and a mix of both solutions. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if higher concentrations would result in higher heart rates and slower recovery. Rates during and after exposure were compared with baseline rates: the mean of the three rates before exposure. With MSG, heart rates decreased with increased concentration and showed no clear recovery to baseline rates. For HFCS and the HFCS-MSG mix, heart rates over time showed no clear correlation to concentration and while some heart rates appeared to head toward baseline rates, only 0.3125 % HFCS leveled out near the baseline rate by the end of the experiment. Overall, the variation in response, as measured by the standard deviation of the percent change from baseline rates, increased over time and with concentration. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA test) for the control showed no statistical difference in Daphnia heart rate with time. ANOVA tests showed that MSG and HFCS significantly affected heart rate after but not during exposure and the HFCS-MSG mix affected rates during and after exposure. The null hypothesis was rejected. The data did not support the hypothesis that rate would increase and recovery would be slower with increasing concentration.

EVIDENCE FOR A ROLE OF GENETICS AND FOALING DATE IN EQUINE WOBBLER SYNDROME
Miranda Nickole Richardson
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Cervical Stenotic Myelopathy (CSM), commonly known as Wobbler Syndrome, is a musculoskeletal disease of young horses. Malformations in cervical vertebrae cause structural narrowing of the vertebral canal, which produce severe neurological deficits through spinal cord compression. CSM is a complex disease with proposed contributing factors of genetics, high planes of nutrition, trauma, and rapid growth. Due to the complex nature of CSM, interplay between genetic and environmental factors is suspected. Two specific aims were addressed in this study: 1) Examine the role of foaling date as a predisposing factor to CSM, and 2) Perform a genome wide association study (GWAS) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify the role of genetic determinants in the development of CSM. For the first objective, foaling dates were collected on 225 Thoroughbreds with a confirmed diagnosis of CSM and compared to the general population of registered Thoroughbreds (n=105,757) over an 11-year period. Both groups were limited to foals born in Kentucky. A significant shift to earlier foaling dates was observed in CSM horses (p-value = 0.0204). For the second objective, venous blood samples were drawn for DNA isolation from 57 Thoroughbreds with CSM and 414 Thoroughbreds from the general population. Genotyping was performed using commercial Illumina Equine SNP50 and SNP70 chips. The analysis yielded several regions displaying evidence of genetic associations, specifically loci on equine chromosomes 2 and 28 with multiple closely related SNPs displaying significant linkage disequilibrium. The combined results are consistent with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to CSM.

THE EFFECTS OF ROUND-UP® AND ITS COMPONENTS ON PALAEMONETES PALUDOSUS THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS OF EXPOSURE.
Emily Catherine Seitz
Melbourne Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

Glyphosate and polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) are two components of Round-Up®. Glyphosate influences metabolic processes of the Shikimate Pathway by mimicking the molecule phosphenolpyruvate (PEP) and inhibiting necessary growth enzymes (Ho, 2005). POEA, the primary surfactant, is known to be toxic to human placental cells (Richard, 2005).<br><br> <br><br>While the parent company of Round-Up® claims the herbicide is safe for organisms, this research set out to identify Round-Up® as an Acetylcholine Esterase (AChE) inhibitor. Furthermore the research will identify which system(s) come under attack. To do this, Ghost shrimp were exposed to Round-Up®, glyphosate and POEA through direct exposure, environmental contamination and bioaccumulation.<br><br> <br><br>Using the Ellman method to analyze AChE activity, tissue was directly exposed to the chemicals identified Round-Up® as an AChE inhibitor (p<0.01). Next, digestive and respiratory systems were assessed by exposure through environmental contamination and bioaccumulation. AChE activity was inhibited (p<0.01) under these conditions. Finally, the integument system was assessed using a Bradford Assay to analyze mucoprotein concentrations when the Ghost shrimp’s environment was contaminated. Mucoprotein concentrations were not significantly affected by the presence of Round-Up®. <br><br> <br><br>This research suggests Round-Up® and its components attack an organism through its digestive and respiratory systems but not through the integument system. It has the ability to be diffused into the blood stream through folds in the gill tissues and through the digestive tract. Further research regarding the effects of Round-Up®, glyphosate, and POEA on the respiratory and digestive systems of aquatic organisms is necessary to pinpoint diffusion locations.

REPELLING EFFECT OF PLANT EXTRACTS ON BEES-A STUDY ON PREVENTING BEES FROM PESTICIDE TOXICITY
YiHua Xu
Bengbu No.3 High School, Bengbu, Anhui, CHINA

Recently more types and excessive amount of pesticides are being used to control plant pests; however, this led to harm bees which are pollinating on the plants. So protecting bees from pesticides is an urgent issue to be solved. The objective of this study was to explore plant extracts to protect bees by driving them away from pesticide-sprayed plants. The extracts are made by soaking Mozzie buster, Artemisia and Lavender which have specific smells respectively in pesticides.<br><br>Research methods and conclusions are as follows: <br><br>The three kinds of plant extracts with concentration 100 ml/L can significantly repel bees when mix the extracts from Mozzie buster, Artemisia and Lavender with sucrose in Petri dishes, respectively.<br><br>Next, we mixed three plant-extracts at concentration 100 mL/L with pesticide to spray on the rapes respectively. <br><br>The results showed that bees rarely settle on the pesticide-sprayed flowers compared with the flowers which were sprayed pesticides only. The efficiency of repellency is order of Mozzie buster> Lavender > Artemisia. All of them last three days to repel bees so that the extract can protect bees from pesticides.

TRANS-RESVERATROL, NATURE’S NEW FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH: A LONGEVITY STUDY OF ITS EFFECT ON ASCARIS SUUM, YEAR SEVEN
Erin Renae Brasser
South O'Brien Community High School, Paullina, IA

trans-Resveratrol’s ability to extend an organism’s life span was tested. Ascaris Suum, a parasitic worm found in swines' small intestines, was the focus based on their average short life span of 72-96 hours outside the pig intestine in a prepared saline solution. <br><br> Worms collected from a slaughter house were placed into a saline solution (1.1 g NaH2PO4, 17g NaH2PO4, 126 g NaCl /1000mL to total 15L), then heated to 37 degrees Celsius. Pure trans-Resveratrol and cranberry puree were added to separate containers of 700 mL saline along with 5 mL ethanol. Ethanol dissolves water insoluble trans-Resveratrol. <br><br> Ascaris Suum were distributed among the varied salines, while some remained in controlled saline with ethanol. Worm activity was observed twice daily and deceased worms were recorded and discarded. <br><br> Worms treated with trans-Resveratrol showed an extended amount of muscle activity long after the average projected life span of A. Suum. The test group showed an average life span of 127.66 hours compared to the control group’s average life span of 86.53 hours. A single Anova test showed unequal variances between groups with a significant 1.49E-06 p-value. f-tests were used to show if there were variances between treatments. A t-test of unequal variances between test and control groups had a significant p-value of 9.85E-07. The t-test between the control group and cranberry extract showed no significant difference at a .80170 p-value. This was confirmed with multiple intra-cellular electrode analyses of the worm hypodermis. This data supports the theory of trans-Resveratrol’s ability to increase the life span of organisms—at least in invertebrate nematodes. This research could potentially support the longevity of humans if ingested as a dietary supplement.

RESEARCH OF LENGTHENING THE LARVAL STAGE OF YELLOW MEALWORMS, (TENEBRIO MOLITORS L.)
Hengli Zhang
Shanhu High School, Chongqing, CHINA

I like birds, and I have learned that there’s a lack of protein feed for insectivores in winter. Therefore, I’m determined to do research on lengthening the larval stage of yellow mealworms. <br><br>I divided yellow mealworms into different groups and then fed them differently. At the same time I carried out contrast experiments. In addition, I observed and studied the four developmental stages of yellow mealworms. <br><br>Methods of lengthening the larval stage of yellow mealworms have been found. The method involves feeding the yellow mealworms in ideal conditions. The most suitable temperature for feeding is 22-25 degrees celsius. The most suitable humidity for feeding is 65-75%.The best mixed feed for feeding is 100grams of wheat bran, 50grams of apples, 20 grams of glucose, 0.5 gram of cholesterol, 0.02 gram of choline chloride, 0.5 milligram of lactoflavin, 40 milligrams of water. This will increase the egg stage to 7-8 days, the pupa stage to 8-10 days, the larval stage to 115-122 days. About 130-140 days are needed to develop from eggs to adults. As a result, the larval stage can be lengthened for more than 20 days. The larvae can gain weight, the adults can lay more eggs, and the rate of hatchability can rise.<br><br>In conclusion, thanks to the scientific feeding, it is possible to lengthen the larval stage of yellow mealworms. Thus,more feed that is high in protein can be provided for insectivores all year round. Besides, the results can provide reference for the businessmen who feed yellow mealworms to make money.

EFFECTS OF TFA ON THE LIFE SPAN AND THE OVIPOSITION NUMBER OF C. ELEGANS
Song Jin
Experimental Senior High School Affiliated to Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, CHINA

Using C.elegans as a biological model, the research observed the effects of TFA on the life span and the oviposition number of three generations(P, F1 and F2) under three concentrations(0.05%, 0.5% and 5%, W/W) aiming to tell the influence that TFA brought to human’s health.<br><br>We found that under the condition of 3 concentrations, Trans Fatty Acids can shorten the life span of 3 generations to Caenorhabditis elegans, while Cis Fatty Acids with low concentration have no such effect. So it is clear that the input of Trans Fatty Acids does affect the Caenorhabditis elegans’ life span and the influence is dosage dependent. We also found that Trans Fatty Acids have momentous reducing effects to F1 and F2 C.elegans’ oviposition numbers even in low concentration, and the affect can be accumulated. The conclusion showed the relationship between TFA and the life span as well as the oviposition number of C.elegans which provides valuable references for food safety assessment. In addition to this, it also further provides that different doses of TFA and CFA have effects on human beings and animals as well as the Molecular Mechanisms of Action.

THE SECRETS OF SOIL ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS: SPECIES COMPOSITION AND BIOMASS IN SPACE AND TIME VARIATION IN JAPAN
Sarasa Yano
Seishingakuen High School, Kashima, Ibaraki, JAPAN

Soil fauna has been recognized as important in engineering ecosystems. In particular oribatid mites, which play a significant role in litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. However the details of this role are not well understood. The aim of the present research is to document the function of oribatid mites in forest ecosystems.<br><br> <br><br>Oribatid mites were extracted from the litter of temperate and cool-temperate forests in Japan at different seasons and different decay classes, and classified into species. The ratio of width to length (W/L) of chelicerae was measured to investigate morphological adaptations to different food types. Stable isotopic C/N ratio and total C/N ratio of sampled oribatid mites and the litter were analyzed by GC-MS to confirm that the mites were feeding on the substrate they inhabited.<br><br> <br><br>Seasonal fluctuation of oribatid mite fauna was clearly observed in both the forests examined. Based on the habitat segregation of the mites, and the correlation of C/N ratios between mites and their substrates, it was revealed that the oribatid mite fauna also varies with decay class, and that the form of chelicerae is closely linked to feeding preference. <br><br>Various decay stages exist in the litter systems of different climatic zones and seasons, and these findings suggest that different species of oribatid mites play roles at each stage. Specifically, oribatid mites with robust chelicerae feed on and inhabit fresh (early decay) litter materials, whereas those with less robust chelicerae feed on fungi or microorganisms, and inhabit soil rich in more decayed plant materials.

LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF EFFECTS OF B-ESTRADIOL ON REPRODUCTION AND LONGEVITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Laura Kathryn Irons
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

This longitudinal study determines if exposure to the “newly emerging contaminant” ß-estradiol in five successive generations plays a role in reproduction and longevity of fruit flies. The next phase determines whether changes induced are reversed when successive generations are raised on traditional water-based medium.<br><br>Fruit flies were bred and raised in medium containing water, 1,000 and 10,000 ng/L ß-estradiol. Virgin males and females were allowed to mate for 96 hours. Each day newly emerged flies were sexed and separated so that their lifetimes could be noted. New generations were started as soon as sufficient parents had emerged. Data were acquired for over 5,000 flies.<br><br>During ß-estradiol exposure, more males emerged than females. Throughout successive generations, ß-estradiol-exposed flies substantially outnumbered the control, especially at 10,000 ng/L. Flies raised with the hormone lived longer than flies not exposed to it. Females generally outlived males, but male lifespan significantly increased with the hormone. <br><br>Post-exposure to the hormone, ß-estradiol lines were also positively affected in regards to reproduction, with the lower concentration line emerging in greater numbers. The ß-estradiol lines continued to outlive the control, suggesting an epigenetic effect. Overall, both reproduction and lifespan increased during and after hormone exposure.

WHAT STINKS?
Terrence A. Price
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

Halyomorpha halys Stål (brown marmorated stink bug, BMSB), native to several parts of Asia, is an invasive species in North America, a nuisance in homes, and an enormous crop pest (over $35 million in damage to the Mid-Atlantic apple industry in 2010). Unfortunately, in our nation the BMSB damages over 200 different crops, is resistant to many common insecticides, and has no natural enemies. Insect specific diseases are currently the most viable option for quickly controlling this insect. Artificial diets were rehydrated with bacterial suspensions, and because the BMSB draws its food using its proboscis, the insects ingested the bacteria. When several known insect pathogens were tested for pathogenicity against the BMSB, insects in the control groups began dying. While this would normally be a setback, the controls seemed to be dying from a natural occurring pathogen and a pure culture of pink bacteria (TPSB-07) was isolated from the gut of several dead insects from the control group. When TPSB-07 was fed to other adult BMSB, the insects died and the same bacteria was then isolated in pure culture from the dead insects; Koch’s postulates were fulfilled, identifying TPSB-07 as the pathogen. Various microbial identification methods were inconclusive, in that none of the results matched each other. TPSB-07 seems to be most closely related to Serratia marcescens, but differs in pigment and urease production. The first naturally occurring pathogen known to kill the BMSB, TPSB-07 is a novel species with the potential to control the detrimental effects of the insect.

IDENTIFICATION OF OCELLAR DEVELOPMENTAL GENES IN DROSOPHILA
Tyng-Shiuan Hsieh
Taipei First Girls High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

The visual system in Drosophila is composed of two large compound eyes and three simple eyes (ocelli). Since the compound eye and ocelli originates from the same eye-antenna disc, I am interested in what is the main factor that controls the differences between the compound eye and the ocelli. I would like to screen the genes involved in compound eye/ocelli cell fate determination and also genes that play significant roles in ocellar development. The research is conducted by using UAS/ GAL4 system as the method to express or knockdown specific genes, singly or in combination. I use trol-Gal4 to express genes in the ocellar precursor cells during the Drosophila development. The adult ocellar phenotype and ocellar marker gene expression pattern can be observed by microscopy and confocal microscopy respectively. So far, I found that expression of several genes in the ocelli can affect the ocellar development. The strongest phenotype comes from ras. Expressing the dominant negative form of ras (ras[DN]) causes the disappearance of ocelli; in contrast, expression of ras resulted in one extra ocellus. I also found that the Egfr dominant negative form (Egfr[DN]) also causes the reduction of ocelli. Since ras is a signaling component downstream of Egfr, I suggest that EGFR-RAS and downstream signaling pathway control the ocellar development. Furthermore, I probe into the genetic interaction of the EGFR-RAS and downstream signaling pathway in ocellar development.

WE COME IN PEACE! ORCONECTES RUSTICUS DISPLAYS MINIMALLY AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS WHEN COMPETING WITH APPALACHIAN CRAYFISH IN MESOCOSMS
Vincent Jacob OLeary
Wheeling Central Catholic High School, Wheeling, WV

Invasive animals pose a serious threat to biodiversity and economic growth. An invasive species of crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, damages aquatic plants, hurts fish populations, and eliminates native crayfish species. Largely spread by anglers, O. rusticus is currently found in 23 states, Canada, and France. O. rusticus is about to reach the Great Lakes and damage a multi-billion dollar fishing industry. Aggression is suspected to give O. rusticus an advantage over native species when competing. To see if aggression does give O. rusticus an advantage, I observed interactions between Cambarus carinirostris, Cambarus robustus, Orconectes obscurus, and O. rusticus in mesocosms developed to mimic conditions based on my field observations. I hypothesized that O. rusticus would cause more frequent and longer fights. Crayfish interactions were observed over an 84 hour period. Data analysis showed no differences in number or length of aggressive interactions, disproving my hypothesis. Analysis of over 20,000 minutes suggests O. rusticus uses a more conservative approach in invasion than predicted. Rather than overpowering native species through aggression, O. rusticus appears to overwhelm native species through more indirect methods. This investigation delineates a mechanism for invasion by a non-native species of crayfish and lays groundwork for development of management techniques.

THE EFFECT OF THE REMOVAL OF THE RHOPALIA ON THE AURELIA AURITA, YEAR THREE
Manu Vaish
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

The Aurelia aurita, or moon jellyfish, is the most commonly found jellyfish on the California coastline. The jellyfish has eight rhopalia symmetrically spaced out across the bell. The rhopalia are the Aurelia aurita’s sensory organs that serve to sense light and gravity in the water. <br><br><br>The objective of this study was to determine if the removal of a certain pairing of rhopalia would result in a hula-hoop movement of the Aurelia aurita. The concept was that the eight rhopalia would be similar to our human nervous system. One pair of rhopalia would function as the brain while the other six rhopalia would act as neurons. With the main brain pair of rhopalia gone the jellyfish would exhibit the movement, whereas if a neuron pair of rhopalia were removed the jellyfish would still function normally.<br><br><br>One pair of adjacent rhopalia was removed from 60 jellyfish and, the jellyfish were placed into a tank to observe their movement without those rhopalia. There were seven different parings of rhopalia possible; therefore in order to provide support for the theory 1/7th of the cut jellyfish should have shown the hula movement. Out of the 60 cut, four exhibited the movement. Running this data through a chi square test, resulted in a 0.0918 chi square value supporting the idea that the two populations were statistically similar yet they differed in the rhopalia being removed.<br><br><br>This study was done in order to better understand the regenerative capabilities of the Aurelia aurita, in order to one day apply the same techniques in regenerative medicines for humans.

Harbor High School, Santa Cruz, CA

Goals/Objectives<br><br>In four experiments, my goals are to determine why the Neuroterus saltatorius galls jump, at what optimum temperature, how much energy is required/how do galls jump (with a model), and how far? How fuel effecient are the galls? Experiment can be applied, using the same principle of momentum transfer to develop a landing rover for Mars, which has no external moving parts, using fuel efficiently.<br><br>Methods:<br><br>1: Can galls sense humidity?<br><br>Measure the jumping rate of galls at one minute intervals. 10 galls in each of the following environments:dry(created by calcium chloride in the petri dish),humid (created by washcloth soaked in water, and control<br><br>2: Optimum Temperature<br><br>*Record jumping rate/min beginning at 0*C,continuing at intervals of 5*C<br><br>3: Energy, Jumping Mechanism, Model<br><br>Test hypothesis by assuming fat is the energy source. Find the amount of fat (in grams) that the gall must contain in order to jump for its lifetime. Using the model, measure distance that the mousetrap will jump using different amounts of weight.<br><br>4: How far can a gall jump?<br><br>Use photographs to find distance gall can jump/min,multiply by length of galls jumping cycle.<br><br>Results:<br><br>Galls jump at a higher rate in dry than humid environments. Galls do not jump below 20*C. Jumping rate increases to about 30-35*C,then levels off. Each gall must contain 1.857x10^-7 g fat to jump for the duration of life. Each gall contains 6x10^-3 g fat. Galls use fat to jump through momentum transfer(see model)Galls can jump for over a mile,and are very fuel efficient.<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>Galls jump at a high rate in dry environments,likely to avoid drying. Galls don't jump below 20*C,so are active primarily during day.Ample fat sustains above average jumping rate.Galls jump by momentum transfer of fluid inside larva.

A BEHAVIORAL COMPARISON OF LABORATORY REARED STOCK AND RECENTLY CAPTURED FRUIT FLIES (DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER) USING UPWARD MOVEMENT, PHOTOTAXIC, AND STARVATION ASSAYS
Trinity Russell
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are model research organisms and are frequently reared in research institutions. Research specimens domesticated in a laboratory reared setting may have different behavioral phenotypes as compared to their wild counterpart. Additionally, it has been determined that the absence of “key” stimuli in the physical environment of captive animals may result in altered behavioral patterns (Price, 1999). The purpose of this investigation was to test for differences in the behavioral phenotype of outdoor captured fruit flies as compared to laboratory reared fruit flies with the use of three tests: an Upward Movement Assay, a Starvation Assay, and a Phototaxic Assay. Results from the upward movement assay demonstrated statistical differences in the vertical moving speed of laboratory reared flies and outdoor-caught flies. Results from the phototaxic assay revealed outdoor captured fruit flies exhibited a natural phototaxic behavior while laboratory reared flies exhibited an inverse phototaxic behavior. The starvation assay proved that flies recently descended from outdoor caught fruit flies were able to withstand starvation twice as long as laboratory reared flies. These results indicate a strong behavioral difference between flies that are descended from laboratory stock and flies that are caught from the outdoors. Research regarding the differences in domesticated organisms is an imperative topic for study because changes in the behavioral phenotype may alter the results of research experiments. Thus it is crucial to have a thorough comprehension of the behavior of outdoor caught flies as compared to the behavior of their wild counterpart.

SLEEP DEPRIVATION IN FRUIT FLIES
Daulton Sink
School Without Walls, Washington, DC

There are many different theories as to why sleep is important. Probably the most logical of these theories is that sleep developed for energy conservation. In order to test this several different studies were conducted on fruit flies, using control groups six hour deprivation groups and nine hour deprivation groups. By looking at the differences between the initial and final masses of each tube percentage of weight lost was calculated. Post sleep deprivation there appeared to be no significant difference in food consumption versus prior to sleep deprivation. Additionally, flies were observed with cameras, pre, and post sleep deprivation, in order to observe motor activity. Prior to sleep deprivation flies in deprivation groups showed medium to low activity levels, compared to post deprivation during which female flies showed little to no activity, while male activity took longer to drop. This provides evidence that flies were not affected by variables other than sleep deprivation. ATP assays were performed on each group of flies. Results from assays were found to show a decrease in energy with an increase in sleep deprivation, which proved to be significant at the .05 level. These results show the necessity of sleep for conservation of energy.

RAPID EVOLUTION OF BROWN TROUT IN THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS
Mingsha Zhou
Marianopolis College, Westmount, Quebec, CANADA

This study examines the founder’s effect on two populations of brown trout derived from two and three ancestors, respectively, after 19 years in a virgin environment. It also examines the effect of transplantation on individuals moved from one river system to another, after one year. Photos of 522 specimens captured in 2010 in Claree River and Val Travers River of the Kerguelen Islands, and 429 specimens captured in these same rivers in 2011, were analyzed using geometric morphometrics. Landmarks, permanent locations identifiable on each fish, were placed on the left-hand side photos of these specimens using the software TPSDIGS2. The distinguishing feature of geometric morphometrics is that it retains information on spatial covariation among landmarks; traditional approaches use one-dimensional distances without consideration of where a given measurement is taken relative to others. I calculated the shape consensus, centroid size, partial warps, and relative warps, factors of variation between specimens, using the software program TPS Relative Warps. <br><br>Major sources of variation within populations are head size, body depth, length of midsection (gills to dorsal fin), and position of dorsal fin. Canonical variants for year, site, centroid size, and the interaction between year and site, were calculated in JMP, a statistical software suite. <br><br>The brown trout has taken over 27 lakes and rivers of the eastern region of the Kerguelen Islands in less than 10 generations. This species is also a very popular sport fish in North America, so there are numerous proposals to introduce it into river systems. However, this study shows that brown trout can potentially turn into an invasive species and drive local trout or salmon species to extinction, a scenario to be avoided.

Phornwimol Siabbamrung
Takhliprachasan School, Nakhonsawan province, Nakhonsawan, THAILAND

Preliminary observation of the area in Takhli District, Nakhonsawan Province, Thailand showed that the area was covered with lime stones and there were many living organisms not usually found in other geological surrounding. Millipedes is one of the plentiful organisms observed. The objectives of this project were 1. To survey the diversity of millipedes in this local area 2.To observe the physical and biological conditions of their habitats and the life cycle of the millipedes. The limestone area was divided into 4 areas and the general geographic and environmental descriptions of each area was classified and recorded. A total of 4 super orders, 8 orders and 21 species of millipedes were identified and recorded. It was observed that the millipedes found in the area consumed fruits and vegetable. The life cycle of one selected species in the order spirostreptida was studied and found that its life cycle was around 10-15 months. It was noticed that the plants found in this area were healthy and plentiful. The faecea of the millipedes was collected and mixed with soil and plant growth on the soil was observed in comparison with chemical fertilizer normally used. Experiments showed that the millipedes’ faecea stimulated plant growth as good as the chemical fertilizer. In checking the organic compositions of the faecea. it composed of 8 ppm phosphorus,228 ppm potassium and 7,100 ppm calcium . one established characteristics of millipedes is scavenger of dead plants.The information obtained in this study showed the diversity of the millepedes and their contribution to the richness of the soil, giving a good reason on conservation of the local millipedes.

THE MIGRATION PATTERN OF MACROBRACHIUM OHIONE SHRIMP IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
Malika Vidya Shettar
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

The Macrobrachium ohione shrimp once abundant all along the Mississippi River have decreased in population in recent decades. Factors that affect the migration of juvenile shrimp at the Vicksburg site of the Mississippi River were examined. Shrimp traps collected juvenile shrimp at the surface and at the bottom of the river, at night and in the day, at different times of the year, and in the main and secondary channels. The numbers of shrimp found in these various locations and times was analyzed. Findings supported that the juvenile shrimp migrate more in warmer temperatures and at night. As well, shrimp migrate during the day by crawling at the bottom of the river not just floating at the surface at night. Such information can be helpful in future potential conservation efforts.

COCKROACHE ARMAGEDDON: NATURAL REPELLANTS IN THE ROACH WARS
Sheldon Nikole Strang
Southmoore High School, Moore, OK

The purpose of this project was to test the effectiveness of natural plants and herbs at repelling cockroaches in ways that are safe for the environment and consumers. Cockroaches are one of the most distasteful insects. They can cause health problems, destroy homes, and are said to be the hardest insects to exterminate. This research will try to find a natural and easily refillable essence that can repel cockroaches in the consumer’s home. First, using the distillation process, five different plant essences were extracted from plants that are suspected of being cockroach repellants. Then, ten cockroaches were placed in a 4inch wide, 200 centimeter long tube with each essence separately tested on the other end. Data was collected on each cockroaches scattering distance for each essence. Next, an obstacle test was performed; food was placed on the opposite side of the tube and observations were made on whether the roaches would cross the essence to get to the food. The second phase of this project included watching mating behaviors over a 10 week period and observing the effects on birth rates when exposed to the essences on a continuous basis.

A MRSA THREAT IN CAFOS: SWINE VS. BOVINE
Micaela Jayne Bryant
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA

This project is the result of experimentation on possible livestock MRSA colonization and animal handler occupational MRSA exposure at selected Iowa swine and bovine Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. Anterior nares of swine and bovine in 4 age groups housed at the CAFOs and liquid samples from the perimeter of each lagoon were initially cultured on blood agar resulting in a dense overgrowth of Bacillus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making colony isolation impossible. New samples were collected and phenylethyl alcohol agar employed to limit Gram negative bacterial growth. <br><br>Colonies resembling Staphylococcus aureus were subcultured on blood agar for testing, including catalase, coagulase, Gram staining, and antibiotic resistance. No testing was completed directly from phenylethyl alcohol agar because this selective medium can cause irregular hemolytic patterns during testing. Complete animal population testing was not possible, however each lagoon is comprised of waste from the facilities’ entire population. Because CAFOs use antimicrobials and subtherapeutic antibiotics, and MRSA is detectable in feces, it is reasonable to conclude the lagoon would contain MRSA if it was present at the facility. <br><br>MRSA was not identified in the anterior nares or in the lagoon of the bovine at the selected CAFO; and 40% of the CAFO swine were identified as MRSA carriers, yet it was not identified in the lagoon of the swine. Therefore, this facility's swine are carriers, but it isn't yet passing externally through their feces.

The purpose of this project is to compare the DNA of present day spotted cats in Egypt with Egyptian Mau standard breds overseas, and ultimately with that from a mummified cat, to see if there are any markers in either or both of the modern day cats to the original Mau cats. The Egyptian Mau is the only spotted domestic cat that developed naturally. Egyptian Mau Cats are the oldest known descendents of domesticated cats in existence since Pharaonic time It Is probably recognized from 3500 B.c. This study was addressed the Egyptian Mau as a heritage and culture identity of Egypt. The experiment was designed to find an answer the question Is Egyptian Mau originally recognized at Egypt? The experiment was planned on 3 steps. The first step, was collecting the samples (hair shafts) that have been taken from cats in Egypt, United States of America and ancient cat mummy from the Egyptian Museum. The second step was through extracting the DNA from samples and amplifying certain gen by PCR technique. Finally, the third was done by determinating specific PCR product DNA sequence for the by using DNA sequencer. The results showed that DNA that isolated from native Egyptian Mau was compact band of 1500 bp. these purified DNA sequence were subjected to PCR reaction by specific primers to CR mtDNA region and yield an amplified 492 bp sequence which conducted to DNA sequencer. And also showed that we successfully isolated a pure DNA and CR mtDNA amplified sequence.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MIGRATORY BIRDS AND THE COASTLINE WETLANDS OF CAMUY, PUERTO RICO
Alan Franqui Guzman
Luis F. Crespo, Camuy, PUERTO RICO

This work aims to identify migratory birds visiting coastline wetlands at Camuy, Puerto Rico, from January 5, 2012 to January 23, 2012; it also aims to work as an initial phase study to establish the importance of these wetlands for their travel from Eastern North America to South America. Three field trips were conducted to the range of study: a fresh water pond at Charca Yeguada (18 degrees, 28’57”N, 66 degrees,53’17”), a mud flat at Peñón Amador (18 degrees, 29’21”N, 66 degrees, 52’4”W), and a mangrove at Peñón Brusi (18 degrees, 29’2”, 66 degrees,51’19”W). Forty bird species were recorded. Review of field guides revealed that 22 species (55%) were considered migratory. The frequency with which they were observed was determined for the range and period of study and compared against historical records for the last five years available from the data management page eBird at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. Only for 11 species, a five years data was available. It was found that, for them, observed frequencies range from 33% to 100% and historical frequency goes from 45% to 100%. Finally, having found that 55% of the recorded species hold a migratory status and because, for most of them, both the observed frequency and the historical frequency are similar or, in many cases the same, at least for the last five years, a close relationship between migratory birds and coastline wetlands for the period and range of the study is observed. These facts support the hypothesis, thus, highlighting the importance of these coastline wetlands areas for migratory birds.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF URBANISM ON THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE NESTS OF THE SPECIES COEREBA FLAVEOLA (BANANAQUIT GARDENS)
Brian Ricardo Colon-Rodriguez
Escuela Especializada en Ciencias y Matemáticas University Gardens, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Studies of structure and composition for any bird nest are very few (Pulgarín 2004). This study investigates whether there are significant differences in the structure and composition of the nests of the species Coereba flaveola found in forests and in urban areas. The purpose is to understand how urbanism influences and affects the structure and composition of the Bananaquit nests. To determine if there are significant differences, twenty-five nests were collected for each study area. Nest collection was done one month after the reproduction season of this species. In terms of structure, the height (from the base to the roof), length, width, cavity diameter and cavity depth were measured. In terms of composition, the mass of the nests was measured and the constituent materials identified: leaves, stems and other components. The statistical test that was applied was the ANOVA-single factor, to determine whether there are significant differences between nest found in forest and in urban areas. The P-value was used to know how significant the difference is. After analyzing the results, significant differences were found in the structure and composition of the nests of the species Coereba flaveola in the areas of study. Each of the parameters that were established to represent the structure and composition showed high significance. Therefore it was concluded that urbanism greatly influences the structure and composition of the Bananaquit nests but there are other factors that influence the structure and composition of the nests, such as vegetation and anthropogenic effects.

IDENTIFYING MUTATIONS WITHIN A CANDIDATE GENE ON CHROMOSOME 6 AND EVALUATING THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE ENTROPION PHENOTYPE IN SHEEP
Ashwin Ram Prakash
Curtis Senior High School, University Place, WA

Entropion is a polygenic inheritable trait resulting in the inward rolling of the eyelid that can cause corneal damage or loss of sight. Found in most mammals, expression of the trait is primarily observed in canines and sheep, the latter of which is the focus of this study. Treating defective eyes and culling ewes and rams that produce entropion lambs lead to decreased herd productivity. This study concerns the examination of a genomic region deemed significant by a previous genome-wide associative analysis involving one thousand sheep and IlluminaOvineSNP50’s single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) panel. To identify mutations within the candidate gene located < 15,000 base pairs from the discovery snp, a genomic model was constructed with Vector NTI Advance 11 and used to sequence the mRNA of 8 entropion sheep and 4 controls via polymerase chain reactions. Alignment of the resulting sequences produced chromatograms, which were then analyzed with Contig Express to identify snps, insertions, and deletions that may possibly alter the amino acid chain. This study identified a potentially damaging 91 base pair insertion 354 base pairs from exon 13 that was significantly associated (p = 0.048) with the entropion phenotype in one flock of sheep. Further research applying a more stringent test will address the predictive value, specifically by asserting whether this insertion is broadly associated with entropion in other flocks of sheep. If so, it may become a DNA test that provides invaluable information for the prevention and potential eradication of the entropion defect in sheep herds.

THE EFFECT OF PESTICIDES ON THE LEARNING CAPABILITIES OF PLANARIA
Christina Yah-yun Lee
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

The experiment took place at the Lee Residence where 160 brown planaria were split into two test groups to be exposed to pesticides either acutely or developmentally. The acute group was exposed to 1/9 dilutions of pesticides twice and developmental group was regenerated in 1/25,000 dilutions of pesticides. The pesticides used were Bifenthrin, Carbaryl, and Gamma-cyhalothrin. Classical conditioning was utilized and the average response ratings (ARR) were recorded on a scale of zero to three. The first null hypothesis was there would be no difference in ARR of the planaria exposed to pesticides (both acute and developmental) and the control planaria in spring water. The alternative hypothesis was if planaria were exposed to pesticides acutely or developmentally then the planaria will have lower ARR than planaria which we not exposed. The null hypothesis was rejected with a p-value<0.01 using two-sample t-tests comparing the control to all pesticide groups. The second null stated there would be no difference in ARR between the acute and developmental group. The second alternative was if the planaria were exposed to pesticides developmentally the ARR would be lower than the acute groups. The null was supported with a p-value<0.05. This suggests that pesticides adversely affect the learning capabilities of planaria, and may contribute to hyperactivity.

CLIMATE EFFECTS ON JUVENILE AND ADULT SALAMANDER POPULATION DENSITIES, A FOUR-YEAR STUDY
Nathaniel Wade Hubbs
Camden Central High School, Camden, TN

For four years, trends between adult and juvenile salamander densities and climate data were evaluated. Artificial cover boards were used for salamander monitoring. Captured salamanders (59 Spotted Dusky and 90 Mississippi Slimy) were identified to species, measured, and released. Temperature and precipitation data were collected from a weather station near the study area. Adult and juvenile densities were the highest (2.20 and 2.25 salamanders/square meter, respectfully) during the study period when the mean fall temperature was below average and the total fall precipitation was above average (2009). Adult and juvenile densities were the lowest (0.55 and 0.60) during the warmest and driest study period (2010). Strong inverse correlations with temperature were shown between the juvenile slimy salamander density (-0.91) and the adult slimy salamander density (-0.84). The adult and juvenile spotted dusky densities showed strong positive correlations with precipitation (0.97 and 0.81, respectfully). Based on these findings, the adult and juvenile spotted salamander densities increased with rainfall while the adult and juvenile slimy salamander densities decreased with increasing temperatures.

IDENTIFICATION OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER GUSTATORY RECEPTOR 23A (GR23A) RESPONSE IN OLFACTION AND GUSTATION FOR POTENTIAL INSECT REPELLENT SYNTHESIS
Anirudh Chandrashekar
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Synthesis of insect repellents, prophylactic tools against insect-vector diseases, requires elucidation of insect chemosensation. Utilizing Drosophila melanogaster, a three tier study was conducted to delineate responsive chemosensory mechanisms. Specific tiers investigated 1) potential transient receptor potential (TRP) channel targets as sensory indicators against market insect repellents 2) the underlying mechanisms of odorant signaling 3) reassessment of class homology between olfactory and gustatory receptors through olfactory analysis. Evasive olfactory behavior to an airborne chemical vapor was assessed via the Direct Airborne Repellent Test (DART) assay and gustatory behavioral response via a two-choice behavioral taste assay. As a part of tier 1, the abnormal behavioral response of trpa1 knockout mutants favored repellents with respect to citronella (p=0.006), IR3535 (p=0.00009), and camphor (p=0.0015), suggesting activation through noxious chemicals. Tier 2 presented GPCR mutants with normal aversive behavioral responses, which failed to support the dominance of GPCR signaling in olfaction. Tier 3 identified gustatory receptor 23a (gr23a) role in olfactory sensation, contradicting its present role in gustation. gr23a mutants showed an abnormal olfactory behavioral response to citronella (p=0.02741), IR3535 (p=0.03461), and geraniol (p=0.00948) and presented a normal gustatory response to camphor, supporting the receptor’s role in olfaction. Behavioral response of gr23a mutants encourages reassessment of the present classification system of chemosensory receptors. gr23a and trpa1 genes identified should be used as targets via the K&D test module as a means for synthesis of efficient insect repellents to tackle the proliferation of insect-borne pathogens.

NATURAL SPRINGS VS. MAN-MADE GUZZLERS
Cole Dee Crim
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

The purpose of this project was to see if natural water springs are more efficient to northern Nevada’s wildlife, compared to man-made guzzlers. These are structures designed to capture rain water and snow to provide water to wildlife. I hypothesized that the springs would benefit the wildlife more because there is less human interaction and human scent. I used six motion trigger cameras and 12 SD memory cards. On a Sunday I set three cameras at springs and three at the guzzlers, I waited until the following Sunday to retrieve the memory cards out of the cameras and replace the memory cards. I analyzed the data at school and put the data into data tables, then repeated this process for four weeks. Current results show that the guzzlers are bringing more of a variety of species but less numbers while springs are bringing less of a variety but more numbers. Nevada was extremely dry this fall, so in all of my pictures I didn’t observe any mule deer – the one species that should have been present. This could be because there was not enough snow to cause them to migrate and also it is their prime mating season. I believe this reason is the same for why I didn’t get very many predators such as bobcats and mountain lions. I plan to continue this research in other seasons and over several years to determine climate effects and possibly relocating the cameras to determine altitude effects.

COLORS THAT FLY
Kristi LaRae Goldade
Strasburg Public School, Strasburg, ND

The purpose of my project is to determine if flies are attracted to certain colors or possibly breeds of dairy cows (Bos taurus). I would like to figure out if can increase their cows comfort by breeding them to certain color and naturally reduce the impact of flies on cattle in this way. If I can figure out what color of coat the flies are most attracted to, it may help the herd's level of comfort and reduce the pain of bites from these pests. <br><br> For the experiment, I choose dairy cows of different colors and placed them into color groups. There were four tan colored cows, four brown cows, four white cows, four black and white cows, four black cows, and four red cows. All cows were fed the same type of food throughout the experiment and also held in the same holding pen/pasture during the course. The cows cannot be sprayed with any chemical repellent for at least two weeks before the experimentation takes place. At each milking flies were counted, and I recorded the date and approximate time milking occurred. I used a comb and spray bottle of water to brush off debris and waste found in the square.<br><br> My results showed that flies do attract more to certain colors. Red cows averaged the highest number of flies throughout the course of the experiment. Lighter colors such as tan and white came in with the fewest flies.

THE EFFECT OF COPROPHAGOUS BEETLES (COLEOPTERA: SCARABAEIDAE, GEOTRUPIDAE, AND HYDROPHILIDAE) ON METHANE EMISSION RATES FROM CATTLE DUNG AND A SIX-MONTH SPECIES COMPOSITION SURVEY OF COPROPHAGOUS BEETLES IN LAKE CITY, MICHIGAN
Rachel Joy Rounds
Mecosta-Osceola Math/Science/Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI

Coprophagous beetles and their effect on methane emission rates from cattle dung were studied at Lake City, Michigan for two five-day periods from August 30 to September 8, 2011. Static flux chambers were constructed and used to measure emissions from four treatments set up in a pasture: dung with beetles added and covered with a screen, dung left open for beetle colonization, dung covered with a screen to prevent colonization, and a soil only treatment. Headspace samples were taken at 0, 10, and 20 minutes and were analyzed with a gas chromatograph. Results showed that the beetles significantly reduced the methane emissions on days four and five of both sampling periods compared to dung covered. Coprophagous beetles may impact the greenhouse gas emissions from dung by hastening the drying process and creating a porous environment through their natural activities, therefore decreasing methanogenesis. In addition, a six-month compositional survey of coprophagous beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, and Hydrophilidae) at Lake City, Michigan was conducted. The goal of this study was to obtain background knowledge regarding this area’s coprophagous beetle biodiversity, seasonal activity, and abundance. A total of 10,041 beetles were collected and identified, representing 20 species.

THE GREAT HOG BAIT
Jalen Kiraly Henson
Gilmer High School, Gilmer, TX

The purpose of this investigation was to determine which, if any, locally sold attractants would be the best enticement for feral hogs, in order to help eliminate them from farmlands and ranches in our area through trapping. Six areas were measured and staked using an 11X11 foot low-bottom, meadowland area. Feed corn was used as the control and placed in one area. Then, 7.5 liters of corn was mixed (according to directions) with five different attractants and the following variable were used: Buck Jam, Hog Wild, Pig Out, Pig Crazy, and Hog Draw. Two game cameras were set opposite of one another and results were recorded daily of each of the six areas in the initial response log, climate log, and food log. The investigation lasted 21 days and during that time more corn and attractatnt were added to continue the length and validity of the investigation. Through research, it has been determined that the locally bought hog attractant, Hog Wild, was the most beneficial in attracting first responses from the hogs. However, the hogs did forage on most of the food once they got started and usually left none behind. It was rather intriguing that they ate all of the food except that of the Buck Jam and Pig Out considering they eat corn. Summarily, recommendations to buy the attractant Hog Wild would be made to farmers and ranchers to aid them in their efforts of trapping feral hogs to eliminate them from the land,save our state millions of dollars, and to help feed the hungry each year.

DIFFERENCES IN THE PRIMARY SONGS OF BLUE-GRAY (TRAUPIS EPISCOPUS) AND PALM TANAGERS (TRAUPIS PALMARUM): CONSEQUENCES FOR HYBRIDIZATION
Jonathan Michael Galka
North Broward Preparatory School, Coconut Creek, FL

To the untrained human ear, the primary songs of syntopic blue-gray (Traupis episcopus) and palm tanagers (T. palmarum) sound similar. Furthermore, these congeners occasionally produce hybrids throughout their northeastern South American range. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate similarities and differences in their primary songs to determine whether these act as effective reproductive isolating mechanisms in the rain-forests of Coastal Guyana. I did this by observing the birds and by using a non-linear Olympus recorder to non-invasively record the primary songs of males and females of both species without interfering with their behavior for a randomly selected sample; n=200 individuals. Sonic and temporal parameters including syllable duration, inter-syllable duration, fundamental frequency, number of harmonics, song rate and song time were measured on several waveforms and sonograms for each species. I found that syllable duration, inter-syllable duration, harmonic number, and fundamental frequency were significantly different for blue-gray and palm tanagers, whereas differences in song rate and song duration were not different. Since primary songs in oscine birds function as reproductive isolating mechanisms due to their difference, I concluded that other factors must be contributing to the reported hybridizations between the two species. The primary mechanism is probably mate selection due to female choice of congeneric males’ plumage color and pattern brightness in relation to his vigor. Preliminary observations during courtship indicate that this is the case. It is possibly due to an increase in human-environment interaction in the region in recent years causing a previously nonexistent hybrid rift.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE GENE ON THE IDENTIFICATION BARCODE OF INDIGENOUS RED SEA PORIFERA
Mohammed Dakhil AlJohani
Bin Baz secondary High school, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

The demand for new pharmaceutical production sources has led to investigations of natural bioactive substances. Marine sponges harbor compounds with extensive antineoplastic activities. However, the sponge species diversity is preventing the full usage of these compounds because of its extensive degree of evolution and speciation that needs to be classified. The Red Sea is a unique environment and there is an urgent need to classify these creatures as it may lead to discoveries of new drug-producing species. The study aims to validate an identification barcode and test its efficiency in becoming a molecular taxonomic signature for Red Sea Porifera (the sponge Phylum). Which can aid the traditional taxonomic method in being a more precise and less time-consuming process. Porifera traditional taxonomy depends on morphological criterion (e.g. spicules and architecture properties). However, comparing morphological characteristics is highly variable and unsuitable for an unambiguous classification, thus making it difficult for taxonomic experts. The molecular method used the Cytochrome c oxidase gene sequence as a Porifera barcode. A Red Sea Porifera was obtained and DNA extracted, amplified and purified. The gene sequencing was then determined and analyzed through the NCBI BLAST database, ClustalX and MEGA5 software. Analysis of the molecular and morphological identification led to speculations of an unclassified species. Potentially, the faster we can identify these creatures the more likely we can discover more sources verified for these natural bioactive substances. Therefore, treatment of human diseases such as malaria, AIDS, and cancer can potentially increase.

TRANSCRIPTIONAL CHANGES IN BORRELIA BURGDORFERI THAT CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER IN NEUROLOGICAL TICK-BORNE LYME DISEASE
Lucy Michelle Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

Tick-borne Lyme Disease (LD), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (B.b.), a parasitic spirochete, is the most common vector-borne and arthropod-borne disease in the US. These spirochetes enter the human brain, causing Lyme Neuroborreliosis, in up to 40% of LD clinical infections. The Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), an endothelial cell lining of the cerebral capillaries, functions as a protective barrier for the brain, denying access to many compounds including drugs, parasites, and other pathogens. The B.b. spirochetes are able to penetrate the tight junctions of the BBB and cross into the brain causing neurological infection.<br><br>In this project, B.b. was studied to determine the transmigration into the BBB. Using a monolayer of Transfected Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (THBMEC), grown on an insert with 3µm pores, and motile B.b. spirochetes, a model for this study was developed. In monitoring the growth of the brain cells, a Transendothelial Electrical Resistance(TEER) of 18-25Ω indicated the tight junctions of the cells most closely approximate the function of the human BBB, indicating ideal condition for B.b. deposition atop the monolayer. After incubation, the B.b. that crossed the BBB were harvested and counted. DNA and RNA were extracted from B.b. harvested from both top and bottom of each insert. Real Time, Quantitative, and Reverse Transcriptase PCR were run in triplicate on all samples. Samples were evaluated to select optimal cDNA to run on specialized PCR. Results of the specialized PCR were studied for changes in gene expression of the spirochetes that were able to cross this barrier.

A STUDY ON THE REACTIONS OF THE ZOPHOBAS MORIO TO HUES OF LIGHT
Shadrach Foster Jakes
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose of the experiment is to show a preference in colors of the Morio worms to make a new non chemical bug repellant. If Zophobas morio worms are exposed to different colors of light, then they will react to them and be able to tell the colors apart. Shades of light were tested on 5 worms at a time, and all results were recorded, and the permutations and combinations of 16 shades of light were taken two at a time, as well as each light separately. During testing, time for reaction to take place, the path of movement, whether the worms were moving or still, and whether the worms were repelled from or attracted to light were all measured. The color green was tested first, resulting in repulsion from it, in a straight line starting at 10 seconds, until the end of testing, 60 seconds, and the worm was agitated afterwards. The color red caused the worms to rapidly move away immediately in a curved line for the full minute, and were still after the testing. Lighter shades of blue resulted in more attraction, red had faster repulsion with lighter shades, and green shades had little or no reaction with lower level lights, usually moving slightly away. Red lights left insects still, blue agitated, and green showed no distinction. After this, all color permutations were tested to ensure the most accurate test results. Same data was present in both cases.

CONTROL OF DROSOPHILA HEART RATE (HR): THE EFFECTS OF CA++ AND CA++ REGULATION ON THE LARVAL DROSOPHILA HR
Valerie Sarge
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

The larval Drosophila heart is myogenic in its heart rate regulation. Dissected in situ preparations of the heart are routinely used to study the cell physiology of the larval Drosophila heart. Calcium (Ca2+) is essential for cardiac contraction and likely for the rhythmicity of the pacemaker potential. Thus, I have examined the influence of various Ca2+ concentrations on heart rate using a HL3 saline with pH 7.1. I have also examined the effects of 5,6-Carboxyeosin, a drug that inhibits plasma membrane calcium pumps (PMCAs) and thereby causes errors in [Ca2+] regulation, on heart rate. My results show that the HR of a Drosophila larva decreases significantly after dissection. Altering the bathing concentration of Ca2+ produced bi-phasic effects on the HR. Between 0.5 and 8 mM [Ca2+], greater calcium concentrations correspond to lower HRs, with the exception of 1 mM Ca2+, indicating that two different mechanisms might be targeted by the Ca2+ influx, depending on the resulting cytosol [Ca2+]. HR decreases over time when a Drosophila larva is left in situ, regardless of [Ca2+], and decreases in the difference between the concentrations over time demonstrate HR regulation, suggesting that there are endogenous mechanisms that regulate cytosol [Ca2+]. Therefore, I examined the roles of regulatory proteins that impact [Ca2+]i in cardiac myocytes using pharmacological approaches. The presence of carboxyeosin, a PMCA inhibitor, decreases HR. Taken together, my data suggest that PMCAs are essential in re-establishing resting levels of cytosol [Ca2+] and thus restoration of the pacemaker potential in the larval Drosophila heart.

NOVEL BIOASSAY TO EVALUATE DEVELOPMENT BEHAVIOR OF THE MOSQUITO AEDES AEGYPTI (DIPTERA: CULICIDAE) IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA
Manuela Jojoa-Portilla
Cleveland High School, Cleveland, MS

The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) is considered one of the most important vector of dengue and yellow fever in the world. Its reproductive and development behavior have been studied for years in order to develop a cure for the virus that this insect transmits. The standard existing method that allows Aedes mosquito to hatch artificially under laboratory condition is by vacuuming the eggs through a dehydrator, because the hardness of the egg shells. This method causes high mortality and low insect quality making them difficult to use for bioassay studies. The new method consisted in the use of a 2 % solution of pig chow media (98 ml of about 29°C boiled water + 2 g of pig chow media) that allows a better hatchability of the mosquito egg. The solution in warm water makes the egg shell tender provoking an emergence as if it would occur in nature, producing insects of higher quality. The insects obtained in this research were used to get a better understanding on how the development behavior of the mosquito affects the life of humans. Effect of temperature on life cycle, adult longevity and larva survival were evaluated. Statistical analysis SAS and Tukey’s test were used to evaluate differences among treatments. This method can significantly reduce cost and increase the accuracy of test results. This could lead to the development of better control measures against mosquitos.

THE ABILITY OF TRAINED BEES TO DETECT VOLATILE SUBSTANCES
Nicolena Teal Stiles
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, VA

This experiment examined the associative learning response of Apis mellifera to conditioning with different volatile substances. Classical conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) was used in conjunction with the conditioned stimulus vapors and the unconditioned stimulus sucrose. Bees were chilled in sets of 3 on ice for 2.5-3.5 minutes. They were then placed inside tubes lined with cotton and taped into place. Bees were left to grow accustomed to their harnesses for 30 minutes. After allocated time had passed, bees were taken to the testing area, which was equipped with a 20 mL syringe containing the scent and an exhaust system to vent scent from the air. In the training period, the bee would be presented with the scent, the conditioned stimulus, for a total of 10 seconds. During the last 6 seconds, the bee was presented with the unconditioned stimulus. After a 2 minute interval, this process would repeat, for a total of 3 training sessions. The testing period consisted of 3 exposures of the bee to the scent. A total of 5 scents were taught to the bees with a 100% response rate: petroleum, butane, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. The illicit drugs were tested using pseudo substances.

THE GLOBAL INVASION AND SETTLEMENT OF THE JAPANESE OYSTER, CRASSOSTREA GIGAS: ASSESSING THE OYSTER AS A BIO-ENGINEER-AND ITS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL INFLUENCE
Kei Landin
Kitas Senior High School of Natural Sciences, Gothenburg, Västra Gotalands lan, SWEDEN

The Japanese oyster’s (Crassostrea gigas) late invasion is on the brink of irreversibly changing marine and estuary environments globally. Deliberately introduced to hatcheries all over the world, the oyster has found ways to escape and revealed itself to be ecologically harmful. Acting as an amensalistic parasite and bio-engineer, the oyster harms other species and forms complex 3D-reefs, causing ecological chain-reactions. This eco-damage was believed to be restricted by winter climate and low tide, but this is now proven to be false as the oyster has settled in Scandinavia and North America.<br><br> <br><br>In an attempt to understand the premises for successful settlement, this study comprises of a systematic review of existing research, a compilation of winter mortality inventories, and the design of niche-models. The latter, which were mapped using available biodiversity informatics tools and species occurrence records, are colored to show taxon richness, and plausibly depict the Japanese oyster’s global distribution in correlation to its predators. These 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid maps indicate the current situation, and also depict the effect of global climate change on propagation for the next 50 years.<br><br> <br><br>My three-fold study suggests the oyster’s propagation may have been underestimated and shows that the oyster could engulf eastern America, and other parts of the world thought to be immune to invasion. The results of this study emphasize a need for a) intervention to avoid further oyster spread and b) assessment before future introductions of other alien marine species.

EFFECT OF FOOD TYPES ON QUANTITY AND NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF WEAVER ANT, OECOPHYLLA SMARAGDINA, LARVAE
Kitthanaet Thanaroungrochthawee
Kanthararom School, Kanthararom District, Sisaket, THAILAND

The weaver ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) larvae are normally collected and commercialized as a popular delicacy with expensive prices in northeastern Thailand. In order to gain knowledge toward better production of O. smaragdina larvae as a protein-rich food source for human, this project aims to study effects of food types on the amounts of food consumed, amount of larvae produced, and the nutritional value in the larvae under conditions similar to their natural habitat. 500 grams of four types of food; namely rice, cricket, fish and mixed ingredients of rice, crickets and fish, were used as food sources for the larvae. The experimental results show that the crickets are the most preferable food with the highest rate of consumption. Most importantly, the mixed ingredients food yields the highest quantity of larvae at 592.3 ± 31.77 grams which is approximately 1.18-fold higher than the cricket group (501.17 ± 28.82 grams) and 2.27-fold higher than the control group (261.00 ± 37.87 grams). In addition, different types of food yield no significant difference in terms of nutrients such as crude protein, carbohydrate, fat and calories in the larvae. These suggest that the mixed ingredients food may be the best food type as it results in the highest quantity of larvae without a decrease in nutritional value compared to other food types. The prospect of this study thus supports the weaver ant farming as it benefits a source of high-protein food for human, increase income for rural farmers, and decrease deforestation.

STRESS AFFECTS ON SWINE
Neela Ann Andres
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS),a co-dominate gene, affects a sow’s ability to be a productive mother. The three branches of productivity are: Conception Rate, Number Born Alive (NBA) and Average Daily Gain (ADG). Year one focused on calculating productivity and matching it with a stress status to determine a correlation. Year two compiles more data, but with an added concept- conception rate. Conception rate is often over looked because it is not quantifiable. However, conception rate is the most important aspect because productivity can not be measured if there are no offspring. Conceiveing is the first step to any animals productivity, without a conception rate the Number Born Alive tests, Average Daily Gain tests cannot be conducted. Also the Sow Productivity Index cannot be generated. This study shows that stress carrier swine cannot conceive as easily and are therefore less fertile. Two of five stress carring sows did not conceive initially. Furthermore, 50% of the sows that were stress carriers did not conceive post weaning compared to the 100% conception success rate of the control group. In addition their Sow Productivity Index scores are lower. Sows without PSS have an average SPI of 110.81, whereas PSS affected have a SPI score of 62.39. A difference of 48.42 SPI units. Stress carrieng sows simply cannot compete with unaffected sows because they are lacking the first step, conception rate.

EXQUISITE FORMATION OF EYE PIGMENTS IN PUPAE AND IMAGOES OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Nozomi Ugajin
Saitama Prefectual Kawagoe Girls' Senior High School, Kawagoe, Saitama, JAPAN

In Drosophila melanogaster, eye colors become visible after pupation and consistently change throughout the pupal stage. With the hypothesis that the eyes incorporate intermediary compounds of pigment-synthesizing pathways (PSP) before the final pigments were made, experiment was conducted to determine which pigments or pigment precursors were synthesized at various developmental stages of fruitflies. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to identify the kinds of pigments of the whole body of larva, the upper half of pupa and eyes of imagoes. Ommochrome and sepiapterin were invariably detected in larvae and pupae of the wild type and the mutant white (w). Of the wild type and w, isoxanthopterin was obtained in 1-4 day-old pupae and biopterin was found in 5-7 day-old pupae, while drosopterin was found only in 5-7 day-old pupae of the wild type. These results showed that the final products of PSP were already synthesized in the larval stage and clearly demonstrated that pigment synthesis changed during the course of development in both the amount and the type of pigments.<br><br>In the present experiment, 4 kinds of eye pigments were really detected in samples of w larvae, pupae and imagoes, although it has been believed that w lacks eye pigments due to defects in ABC transporter. The result indicates that ABC transporters are present on the membranes of pigment granules and actually transport ommochrome and precursor of pteridine in w. Further experiments are necessary to prove the above idea.

CULEX QUINQUEFASCIATUS OVIPOSITION RESPONSE TO ORGANIC INFUSIONS FROM COMMON FLORA OF AMERICAN SAMOA
Allison Marie Fitisone
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

With the spread of arboviral diseases on the rise, studies on mosquito oviposition have become very popular. A study was carried out to evaluate the oviposition response of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to five organic infusions prepared from flora of American Samoa. A laboratory cage oviposition bioassay was conducted with gravid mosquitoes in which containers were filled with infusions of Alocasia macrorrhiza, Bothriochloa bladhii, Cocos nucifera, Mangifera indica, and Morinda citrifolia leaves or tap water. In addition, a Y-tube olfactometer bioassay was conducted to evaluate the influence of olfaction on oviposition. Based on an Oviposition Active Index, the present study showed that all five infusions are attractants for Culex quinquefasciatus oviposition. This study also shows that olfaction plays a major role in the oviposition response of Culex quinquefasciatus. The five infusions can be utilized as attractants for ovitraps or gravid traps to develop a strategy to minimize the mosquito population and therefore reduce the spread of arboviral diseases.

INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS ON REPRODUCTION OF THE RED MASON BEE (OSMIA RUFA L.) ON THE EXAMPLE OF A MEADOW, AN ORCHARD, A FOREST AND AN ARBORETUM
Anna Julia Kusnierczak
Liceum Ogolnoksztalcace sw. Marii Magdaleny, Poznan, POLAND

According to 'New York Times', 40% of honeybee population in the USA has died by 2006. As Albert Einstein said, 'If the bee disappears form the surface of the Earth, man would not have more than 4 years to live.No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man.' Therefore, the dying of bees causes a serious problem not only for the beekeepers but also for all people.<br><br>Due to the decreasing number of honeybees, the role of alternative pollinators becomes increasingly important. Red mason bee (Osmia rufa L.) is a solitary bee which was shown to be a successful pollinator. Therefore, the aim of my study was to search for the best environment that provides the most intense reproduction of red mason bee.<br><br>Four ecosystems: the meadow, the forest, the orchard and the arboretum were tested. A total of 3600 red mason bee cocoons was placed near 48 artificial nests made of reed tubes. Weekly observations were then carried out to find out the dynamics of settlement in artificial nests in each ecosystem. The reproduction level of red mason bee was assessed by counting the number of breeding chambers, the number of empty chambers / chambers with parasites and the number of cocoons.<br><br>The meadow turned out to be the most favorable environment, as the increase of the population size was almost 4 times higher in the next generation. The second favorable location was the orchid. Lower increase of the population size was observed in the forest and surprisingly, the lowest in arboretum. <br><br>Obtained results clearly indicate the meadow and the orchid as the best environments for rearing the red mason bee, aimed at the mass use of the bee as a pollinator of various crops.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF SEPSIS BIOMARKERS USING HIGH THROUGHPUT REAL TIME PCR ANALYSIS
Danielle Pleshette Tyson
William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, NC

Sepsis, a deadly condition caused by bacterial infection of the blood, affects up to 10% of dogs in veterinary teaching hospital critical care units each year. The leading cause of sepsis-related deaths is our inability to rapidly diagnosis the condition. Previous research regarding the pathogenesis of sepsis suggests that proinflammatory and proapoptotic proteins may serve as biomarkers for sepsis. <br><br>Using Real Time PCR, we analyzed a number of critical proinflammatory and proapoptotic genes in healthy dogs and dogs diagnosed with sepsis. Blood samples were collected and total RNA was extracted. RNA quality was tested using the Agilent Bioanalyzer before cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription enzyme kit. Proinflammatory and proapoptotic transcripts from cDNA were measured by Real Time PCR using custom high throughput 96 well plates pre-loaded with primers specific for 86 individual genes of interest and five housekeeping genes. Data was analyzed using the DDCt method to determine fold-difference in gene expression between healthy and septic animals. <br><br>Based on the program analysis parameters, 11 genes were found to be significantly different in expression between healthy and septic animals. These 11 proinflammatory and proapoptotic genes have potential utility as biomarkers in a molecular diagnostic assay for sepsis.

Institute of Computer and Management Sciences, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PAKISTAN

Energy is the most important aspect of life. Many cattle in different parts of the world belonging to poor farmers are affected by adverse climate changes. Farmers cannot afford food for their cattle or do not even know how to take proper care of them. The Energy Square can answer this problem. It is very useful and gives good results, it is also very economical. It can be given to cow, buffalo, ox, sheep or goat. The Energy Square consists of mulberry, molasses, wheat bran, maize bran, rice polish, clay, urea, mineral mixture, anthelmentic, superavit, and Di-calcium phosphate. These products provide great deal of vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates to the cattle which are of great importance. The most important product is the waste mulberry fruit because it cannot be eaten and also may not be sold in the markets. All the ingredients were simply mixed in specified quantities and the mixture was put in the mold. After pressing, the mold was removed and it was left in the shade to dry and harden over the next 48 hours. Experiments were conducted on two cows. For one month 300 grams of Energy Square per day was fed to them which showed remarkable results. The cows produced more milk than before and their general and physical health also improved. It can also prevent multiple diseases. If industrialized and produced on a massive scale and stored, and made available in markets, Energy Square can solve nutrition problem of animals for poor farmers.

MYTILUS EDULIS PROTEIN STRENGTH: MUSSELS HAVE MUSCLES
Nikki Taylor Buhrdorf, Vikash Hypio, 
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

The protein of Mytilus edulis (Blue Mussel) is a strong adhesive that binds the marine animal to rocks in the ocean. It has been extracted and tested as a glue for surgical procedures. The current study was conducted to compare the tensile strength of “mussel glue” to dental glue and super glue on different surfaces and in different environments. The surfaces were steel to steel, steel to bone and bone to bone. The environment was either dry or wet. The mussel glue protein was extracted and the dental and super glues were acquired. Three tests for each glue on each surface in each environment were conducted; a total of 54 tests were conducted. An analysis of variance test was conducted to determine if the glue and the surface had an effect on the tensile strength. A linear regression was conducted to predict the strength of any particular glue type on any surface combination in any environment.

PARASITES INSIDE THORNS: MORPHOLOGICAL AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CRAB PINNAXODES CHILENSIS
Mariana Larroulet Santander, Javier Romanos Zambrano, 
Instituto Inmaculada Concepcion Valdivia, Valdivia, Region Los Rios, CHILE

The sea urchin Loxechinus albus is one of the most important species for the artisanal fisheries in Chile. The crab Pinnaxodes chilensis (Decapoda: Pinnotheridae) lives at the end of the intestine within the sea urchin L. albus. The symbiotic relationship between the two species has not been thoroughly studied in spite of their importance for the development of the aquaculture of L. albus. Both species have a wide geographical distribution along the southeastern Pacific coast. Here we tested the effect of the environment by comparing the morphological and genetic variation in two spatially isolated populations located in Antofagasta (23ºS) and Valdivia (39ºS). We found statically significant differences in size and abundance between both locations. The presence of Zoea larvae, the first stage of the life cycle of the crab, was also found present in the sea urchin. In addition, by using a mitochondrial gene as molecular marker, we found high levels of genetic variation (He=0.9) but no evidence of genetic differentiation when comparing the populations from the two locations isolated by more than 3000 km of lineal coast.

BENEFITS OF THE GLIRICIDIA SEPIUM FOR POULTRY FEEDING
Angie Paola Hoyos Morales, Carlos Alfredo Regino, 
Colegio Diocesano San Pedro Apostol, San Pedro de Uraba, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

Chicken consumption is common in Colombia and represents and important industry worldwide. With this project we wanted to work on an alternative feed for poultry birds, since in dry seasons the weight and number of their egg-laying decreases.<br><br>We know that proteins are important for the good nutrition of these birds and in traditional farming its main source is insects, larvae and worms that are found on the soil. In dry seasons these animals are scarce due to lack of soil-moisture, and grain feed such as corn is costly, since maize crops also reduce their productivity in these seasons. That is why we wanted to look for other feed-sources for poultry birds and we found an alternative in the foliage of the tree Gliricidia sepium, a legume known for its nutritious potential and its widely available distribution. This plant is used as a hedgerow in many places and it easily accessible. In this research we observe that birds gained weight and increased their egg-laying when they were fed with G. sepium constantly during 7 weeks. We concluded that the leaves of this tree, combined with corn and other elements, are a promissory and balanced feed for birds.

INVESTIGATING THE SPREAD OF THE INFLUENZA A VIRUS: A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE H1N1 SUBTYPE
Surya Narayanaraju Bhupatiraju, Hao Shen, 
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

The H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus is one of the most common types of the influenza A virus, and was responsible for the 2009 S-OIV pandemic, the 1918 Spanish Flu, and the 1976 Swine Flu Scare. This project seeks to shed light on the virus's evolutionary history between 1918 and 2009 and reveal trends in its phylogeny. Past studies have not documented this entire time frame, and the few published trees lack strong bootstrap support.<br><br> H1N1 strains from infected humans in the US between 1918 and 2009 were taken from the NCBI and FluDB databases. After aligning the sequences with MAFFT, two principal phylogenetic trees were constructed: a parsimony-constraint tree compiled by PAUP*, and a phylogram compiled by BEAST with an MCMC length set to 60,000,000. These two trees had high bootstrap values and strong posterior probabilities on each branch.<br><br> These results support the hypothesis that the 2009 strains were related to the 1918 strains. In addition, two separate clades of H1N1 were shown to exist: one of which is the seasonal flu, and the other is a triple reassortment virus of avian, swine, and human strains. The route that the H1N1 subtype took as it moved throughout the US was also found, and surprisingly, the time and nucleotide location of H275Y Oseltamivir resistance in seasonal H1N1 were discovered by comparing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data between individual strains and the 'aggregate' swine flu strain.

THE EFFECT OF NATURAL BETA BLOCKERS ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND DAPHNIA MAGNA EXPOSED TO CAFFEINE
Jessica Gabrielle Smith, Madeline Weinfeld, 
Pascack Hills High School, Montvale, NJ

The subject of this experiment was to test the effect of bananas and raisins on Drosophila melanogaster and Daphnia magna exposed to caffeine. The purpose of this study was to determine if bananas or raisins can counteract caffeine’s effect of increasing heart rate and decreasing lifespan of Daphnia magna and Drosophila melanogaster respectively. Claims in literature suggest that potassium counteracts caffeine’s effect and raisins and bananas are both high in potassium. If bananas or raisins counteract caffeine’s effect and Daphnia given NoDoz and bananas or raisins are compared to Daphnia given NoDoz without banana or raisins then the Daphnia with banana or raisins will have a slower heart rate. If bananas or raisins counteract caffeine’s effect and Drosophila given NoDoz and bananas or raisins are compared to Drosophila given NoDOz without banana or raisins then the Drosophila with banana or raisins will live longer. Drosophila and Daphnia given caffeine and banana or raisin were compared to Daphnia and Drosophila given caffeine only and Daphnia and Drosophila given no caffeine. Heart rates were measured and recorded in Daphnia and lifespan recorded in Drosophila. Data showed that that the average heart rate of Daphnia on caffeine alone was 223.33 bpm and percent Drosophila living was zero while compared to raisins Daphnia heart rate was 169 bpm and percent Drosophila living was 71.43. With Lopressor, Daphnia heart rate was 171.33 bpm and percent Drosophila living was 57.14, and non-treated Daphnia had a heart rate of 189.33 and percent Drosophila living was 85.71. This study suggests that consumption of raisins may be effective in decreasing heart rate and may be a natural substitute or adjunct to Lopressor.

THE EFFECTS OF SCHRECKSTOFF ON MINNOWS
Charley Lynn Denmark, Katheryn Bennett, 
Winder-Barrow High School, Winder, GA

Yellowfin Shiners (Notropis lutipinnis) release a pheromone, Schreckstoff, when they are harmed which “tells” the other Yellowfin Shiners in the area to hide. We wanted to test the reactions of the Creek Chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) with this project. We know there is a symbiotic relationship between these two fish; Creek Chubs build the nests for Yellowfin Shiners to lay their eggs in, and due to the size difference between the two fish, Creek Chubs are able to protect the eggs more effectively. According to research, all cyprinidae should respond negatively to the pheromone. This project is designed to test the reaction of the creek chubs. To conduct the experiment, we set a control trap, which contained sardines and three unharmed Yellowfin Shiners. The next trap we set was the Schreckstoff trap, which contained sardines and three Yellowfin Shiners that had been scraped (scraping the fish of a few scales is a way to get them to release Schreckstoff without harming them). This process was repeated multiple times. We found that there was a significant difference between the Chub to Shiner ratio in the Control Trap compared to the Schreckstoff trap. On average, 46% of the fish caught in the control trap were Creek Chubs, and this percentage increases to 77% in the Schreckstoff trap. From this data, we can conclude that our hypothesis was correct. Creek Chubs are attracted to the release of Schreckstoff in an effort to protect Yellowfin Shiners.

INVESTIGATING THE DECLINE OF THE JUVENILE ANGUILLA ROSTRATA POPULATIONS IN THE HUDSON RIVER
Pamela Hope Brigleb, Amanda Bernstein, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Anguilla rostrata (American eel) populations have declined by approximately 90% in the past few decades in the North Atlantic Coastal region; the reason for this decline remains unknown. The purpose of this study was tri-fold: to determine how water quality parameters impact the juvenile Anguilla rostrata populations in tributaries of the Hudson River, to study the relationship between pigmentation in glass eels and stream flow rate, and to investigate the relationship between stream flow rate and the migration of the eel ingress. Sheldon-type fyke nets were used to catch the glass eel ingress daily during the migratory season (March-June) in tributaries of the Hudson River. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) at Furnace Brook of glass eels was 58.71 (N=2466), while the CPUE of glass eels counted at Minisceongo Creek was 11.77 (N=612) in 2011. A YSI multi-probe used to record water quality data which revealed no significance between water temperature and abundance and Furnace Brook (p=0.0788) and at Minisceongo Creek (p=.164) in 2011. There was also a higher CPUE of glass eels when Furnace Brook was in salt water (river mile>37) with a CPUE of 64.69 glass eels, while the total abundance was higher when Furnace Brook was in fresh water (river mile <37) with a total abundance of 1318 glass eels. A flow meter was used to measure stream flow, and a sub-sample of juvenile eels was anesthetized with clove oil to observe the pigmentation stage of glass eels using a dissecting microscope. These findings provide necessary insight on the reason for Anguilla rostrata decline and present opportunities for habitat restoration and conservation.

AN ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF ANTHROPOGENIC FOOD SOURCES IN RAPTOR DIETS USING STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE RATIOS AND STABLE NITROGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS
Hannah Harper Hanson, Christian Seipp, 
Salt Lake Center for Science Education, Salt Lake City, UT

We measured stable isotope ratios 13C/12C and 15N/14N in feather samples to find differences in anthropogenic food sources among four species of migratory raptors: American Kestrels, Red-tailed Hawks, Cooper’s Hawks, and Sharp-shinned Hawks. Recent declines in American Kestrel populations raise questions about the effects of agricultural practices, including pesticide and fertilizer usage.<br><br>Collaborating with HawkWatch International, we obtained contour breast feathers from each species, collected during fall migration at a monitoring station south of Wendover, Nevada. We prepared the samples for isotopic analyses by mass spectrometry at the University of Utah and evaluated the results for statistical differences among species. <br><br>American Kestrels and Red-tailed Hawks hunt in woodlands and open habitats; whereas Cooper’s Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks are generally forest raptors. Ratios of 13C/12C differentiates C3 vs. C4 photosynthetic plants within a food chain. Our data showed higher 13C/12C ratios in the diets of the forest raptors relative to the diets of the open-space dwellers. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, nearly all the forest raptors we sampled had eaten some C4 prey. More than half of the Red-tailed hawks had also consumed C4. Only 32% of the American Kestrels were C4 subsidized, suggesting either that they did not feed in areas of C4-based agriculture and/or invasive grasses or that they failed to access this food source.<br><br>Results of 15N/14N analysis showed no difference across species. Tracing nitrogen ratios is complicated. Plants vary with types of soils and fertilizers, values differ based on how plants fix nitrogen, and 15N/14N can reveal trophic level.

INTERTIDAL INVERTEBRATES AND THEIR NUTRITIONAL VALUES
Taylor Jade Seitz, Alisa Aist, 
Polaris K-12 School, Anchorage, AK

The purpose of this experiment was to decipher whether the lipid values of intertidal macroinvertebrates change depending on the estuary. The first step to start the experiment was to decide on a group of estuaries to collect samples from. After selecting the estuaries, the second step was to visit the estuaries and collect samples matching GLOBE standards. The next step was to examine the samples and collect the data observed. The last step was to send the intertidal macroinvertebrates found in the sample to a lab. The invertebrates were sent to a lab. At the lab, the director analyzed the nutritional value of the intertidal macroinvertebrates found in the mud. The data was then taken back to school and recorded into data tables. <br><br>At this point, the question cannot be fully answered. The results of the data only show the nutritional values of the invertebrates from one estuary. The data also shows that the unknown polychaetes have a higher lipid content than the small and large polychaetes. For now, the data shows that both estuaries house polychaetes and a variety of plant life. The data also shows that the number of polychaetes, within 25cm deep, is decreasing with the dropping temperature. Next year, the project will elaborate into more experiments and more data will be taken and recorded. Hopefully, the polychaetes from our next samples will be able to be identified down to at least the family.

Rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) are one of the major crops grown in the South of Thailand and contribute to high economic value to the country. Thailand has been considered as one of the leading exporters of natural rubber. Rubber farmers have observed that the land snails consume fresh rubber latex in the bark at the tapping sites, and cause the decline in the latex collection. From our investigation in the rubber plantations in Surat Thani province, Thailand, we found 5 snail species namely: Cryptozona siamensis (39%), Achatina fulica (23%), Semperula siamensis (22%), Sarika resplendens (8%), and Chloristis platytropis (8%). Cryptozona siamensis or Siamese snails, the most prevalent species, were commonly found consuming the fresh rubber latex at the tapping sites. The effect of the snail mucus on rubber latex coagulation at the tapping site was further investigated. Experimental results indicated that the mucus led to faster coagulation. The Siamese snail mucus exhibited protease activity. Therefore, the Siamese snail mucus may involve in faster rubber coagulation.

NEW FACTS FROM EXPERIMENTS ON TARDIGRADES IN ANHYDROBIOTIC STATE
Marie Svarcova
Veterinary High School, Hradec Kralove, CZECH REPUBLIC

Tardigrades are claimed to be the most resistant organisms on the Earth. Their resistance ability even increases when in a state of anhydrobiosis.<br><br>This project investigates the degree of tardigrades’ resistance in extremely unfavorable conditions. Experiments conducted were aimed at providing the answer to whether the resistance depends on the location where tardigrades live, and whether it depends on the degree of unfavorable conditions. Tardigrades were collected in three different locations and were exposed to following extremities:(a) extremely high temperatures for certain periods of time,(b) extremely low temperatures for certain periods of time,(c) the temperature of liquid nitrogen,(d) gamma and(e) X rays. The most resistant tardigrade genus was determined and its survival limits for high temperature were assessed. The tardigrades were held in a state of anhydrobiosis while subject to experiments. Experiments were performed on a particular number of individual tardigrades.<br><br>The results show that resistance of tardigrades in unfavorable conditions depends on the locality, on the intensity of extreme conditions, on the genus of tardigrades and on the way tardigrades are put into the state of anhydrobiosis. Experiments revealed that tardigrades living in a location where conditions are extreme are more resistant than tardigrades living in a location where conditions are mild. From all the types researched, the most resistant tardigrate genus is Hypsibius pallidus. The experiments proved that this genus is able to survive conditions temperature 374 F (190 C). In relevant literature described temperature 303,8 F (151 C).<br><br>The experiments have indicated a very resistant genus which might an interesting topic for subsequent experiments.

GENDER DETERMINATION OF LOVEBIRDS
Nicholas Michael Badeaux
Catholic High School, New Iberia, New Iberia, LA

The purpose of this project was to determine the accuracy and reliability of gender determination methods in lovebirds. In the pelvic sexing part of this study 16 lovebirds were examined by 26 participants. The 26 participants had varying levels of experience of working with lovebirds, ranging from 0 to 75 years. Each participant would pelvic sex a lovebird as I brought the bird around to them. They would mark off on a score card if they determined the lovebird to male or female. This was a blind study. The second phase of the research included collecting additional morphometric measurements on the same group of lovebirds. The measurements were analyzed using T-tests to determine the significance of the results.<br><br>The results showed that pelvic sexing is accurate only 70% of the time. This is mainly due to the bone structure of the pelvis of the lovebird. If the bones are too wide it could be mistaken for a female and if they are too small they could be mistaken for a male. Likewise there was no significant difference in the morphometric measurements which would lead to accurate gender determination.

WASMANNIA AUROPUNCTATA: DIFFERENT COMMUNICATIONS IN POWER SEARCH!
Joimarly de Morais Ferreira
School Public Mineko Hayshida, Laranjal of Jari, BRASIL

This research on Wasmannia auropunctata popular called "fire ant" was conceived taking into account the need to control this insect and its attacks that cause great problems in health and economy. In my town it is not difficult to hear people saying they have blisters all over the body because of these ants attacks, besides being a very common practice the waste of food caused by these insects. For this reason, I claimed for a way of keeping them far from our homes, but, how to do that without previously knowing them? This task would be difficult if not impossible, so, I decided to develop this research. In the beginning, I had a very great curiosity to know the life, the communication and how these small animals used to organize themselves, and, during the research, our curiosity became stronger and I were fascinated by those beings. So, as the work advanced, I simulated the smell of food using chemical products in order to prove the hypothesis that "fire ants" use smell to locate their food and that they prefer sweet and fatty food. I also see there is no relationship between "fire" and "black ants" and that they communicate themselves through sound waves. As they are known, by human beings, as predators, ants are wrongly interpreted, and what seemed to be sordid, proved to be innocent and organized. In order to minimize and repel the ants' relationship with food, I used extracts of garlic mixed with red pepper.

RESPONSE OF SOIL INVERTEBRATES TO ELECTROMAGNETIC STIMULI
Teva Paul Ilan
Howard High School, Macon, GA

Successful foraging is critical to the fitness of soil dwelling invertebrates. Thus, investigating stimuli that impact foraging behavior is important. Certain soil organisms use electromagnetic cues to navigate and locate food sources. I investigated attraction to electromagnetic fields in two soil invertebrates: the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, a biological control agent used for pest suppression, and the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta, an invasive pest species. In prior research S. carpocapsae responded directionally to electrical current. However, it was unclear whether they responded only to electrical current or electrical fields without current. Furthermore, response to magnetic fields remained untested. My first objective was to determine response to electrical and magnetic fields. Directional response was determined on agar plates. Treatments included electrical current, electrical field, and magnetic field. The control had no electromagnetic stimulus. Results indicated that nematodes respond to electric and magnetic fields. Conceivably, attraction to electromagnetic fields might be leveraged to enhance biological control efforts. S. invicta causes severe damage to electrical equipment. My second objective was to determine if ants are attracted to electromagnetic fields or pheromones emitted from electrocuted ants. I measured the number of ants emerging towards an electromagnetic field, electrocuted ants, and a control. No treatment effects were detected. The inconclusive results were likely caused by a drastic decrease in ant activity after the first sample date, which was statistically correlated to a substantial decrease in temperature. Future research is needed to address this objective, but warmer temperatures are required.

DAPHNIA DEVELOPMENT: A COMPARATIVE TEMPERATURE AND PHOSPHORUS TOLERANCE EXPERIMENT USING RESURRECTION ECOLOGY OF DAPHNIA PULEX
Nicole Marie Biddinger
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of climate change on genetic evolution in Daphnia pulex through comparative temperature tolerance and phosphorus tolerance competition trials in nine genotypes of resurrected clones ranging in age from the 1500s to present. Heat tolerance data was collected at 28, 32, 34, 35 and 36 degrees Celsius in triplicate. Competition experiments at 20°C and 30°C and cellulose acetate electrophoresis were incorporated to determine genotype dominance between ancient and young clones within the test environment. Survival rate for the younger clones was double that of the ancient clones beginning at 34°C and 35 percent of younger clones lived at 35°C when the ancient clones were unable to survive. All ancient clones died at 36°C while 12 percent of the younger daphnids were tolerant, showing a significant correlation between age and temperature tolerance from heat shock protein evolution with qPCR run for analysis at the molecular level. In the competition experiments at 20°C, 86.6 percent of ancient clones were dominant or equal to the number of younger clones in the jar after 10 days, which tapered to 50 percent after 30 days. At 30°C after 10 days, the ancient clones were 73.3 percent dominant, due to a potential phosphorus tolerance adaptation that occurred. These experiments revealed the current tolerance limits of present and ancient clones of daphnids, reaffirming their ability to sustain themselves through this century, and provided a cornerstone for research on heat shock proteins linked with numerous diseases.

A COMPARISON IN HAEMONCHUS CONTORTUS FECAL EGG COUNTS BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT ORGANIC PARASITE PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN GENETICALLY SELECTED ADULT BOER GOATS
Case Coleman Erwin
St John Lutheran School, Ocala, FL

The purpose of this study was to determine which parasite prevention strategy would be best at eliminating Haemonchus contortus egg concentrations within Boer goat fecal samples. I hypothesized that the pasture rotation group would be the most effective at eliminating H. contortus from fecal egg counts of Boer goats. Fifteen Boer goats from Camelot Acres Goat Facility were separated into 3 test groups. Two groups were assigned an organic parasite prevention strategy (Pasture Rotation and Ruminal Copper) and a control group. Group 1 rotated pastures every two weeks. Group 2 was given a copper supplement once in the beginning of the project. Group 3 was a control group so nothing changed throughout the designated time. Fecal samples were collected from each goat. The goats were weighed. Fecal flotation was performed on each fecal sample and a microscope was used to optain Haemonchus Contortus egg counts per slide. These values were recorded and compared. Collections and treatment was performed on Sept. 16th, Sept. 30th, Oct.14th, Oct. 28th, Nov. 11th, Nov.25th, Dec. 9th, and Dec. 23rd. The pasture Roation group had the greatest overall decrease in the average fecal egg counts per slide ( initial count = 22.2eggs/slide, final count = 8.2eggs/slide). My hypothesis was supported by the results of this study. Pasture Rotation was the most effective at producing a lower number of H. contortus.

THE BISPHENOL BLOWFLY BLITZ: AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PLASTIC MONOMER BISPHENOL-A ON THE METAMORPHIC ACTIVITY OF SARCOPHAGA BULLATA-A A FORENSICS STUDY
Andrew Clark Hopkins
Phillip O. Berry High School, Charlotte, NC

The environmental disbanding of Bisphenol A has led to problems in the growth cycle of many organisms. The goal of our research was to assess BPA’s impacton the metamorphic activity of S.bullata. It was hypothesized that if BPA was introduced to Sarcophaga bullata within progressive concentrations over the course of its metamorphic development, then its life cycle rate would be retarded by a minimum of 1% per increment. Assessing this, 50 blowfly pupae were obtained and divided into 5 terrariums. Each was provided with 6 hours of light, 150 grams of soil, and 5mL of water, but differed in Bisphenol A concentrations (0ug/kg, 1 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) in their food stock (5 grams of a sugar and powdered milk mix at adult stage and liver with proportional BPA concentrations at the maggot stage). All groups were observed for 11 days under 4x magnification to hallmark (body length, width) developmental delays. While BPA tended to increase the size of the S. bullata pupae, it typically retarded the size of the adult (Adult Width:0.96%Adult Length: 5.76%Pupae Width: 6.10%Pupae Length:-6.25%)under the 1ug/kg treatment, (Adult Width:-5.92%Adult Length:1.73%Pupae Width:-1.86%Pupae Length:-2%)under the 10ug/kg treatment,(Adult Width:-8.48%Adult Length:0.61%Pupae Width:9.42%Pupae Length:7.50%) under 100ug/kg, and (Adult Width-5.36%Adult Length: -11.29%Pupae Width: 11.41%Pupae Length: 2%)under the 1mg/kg treatment. The 1 ug/kg treatment had no impact on the percent rate of change on S. bullata metamorphic cycle (0%). However successive and progressive treatments demonstrated a 3% retardation rate impact, (10ug/kg=3.228%100ug/kg=3.228%1mg/kg= 3.228%) rejecting the stated hypothesis.

S.T.E.P. (SUMMER TRANSITION EASEMENT PROGRAM)
Corvin John Schoen
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, MO

A common problem in the production of milk has been the large drop in milk production in dairy cows in the late summer and early fall months. This is especially noticeable in cows that calve in the summer months. My hypothesis is that if dry cows are housed in shaded, dry facilities, and provide a custom tailored fresh cow transition program, average herd milk production will be greater than years before this program was implemented. The results supported the hypothesis as the participating herd showed an average overall increase of 8% of milk production per day during the period where production was normally at its yearly low point.

IDENTIFICATION OF VANADIUM-BINDING PROTEINS AND GENETIC ANALYSIS OF HAWAII SEA CUCUMBER POPULATIONS
Nalani Sachiko Kaku
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

Sea cucumbers are one of the many important species in the marine ecosystem that have unique genetic and physical features. There is an abundance of diversity between different species of sea cucumbers. This project attempts to analyze the CO1 and 16S mitochondrial genes and to identify a vanadium-binding protein (vanabin) located in several tissues of sea cucumbers. The vanabin protein was expressed in the Holothuria atra (Black Sea Cucumber) tentacle tissue and the Opheodesoma spectabilis (Conspicuous Sea Cucumber) intestinal tissue using SDS PAGE. The CO1 and 16S genes were amplified in several tentacle samples of the Opheodesoma spectabilis sea cucumber species, native to Hawaii and located in different areas of Kaneohe Bay and marine center. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in several tissues of the Holothuria atra located in Makapu'u Beach and Waikiki Beach. No SNPs were found in the tissues of the Opheodesoma spectabilis, Actinopyga obesa, Actinopyga mauritiana, and Holothuria pervicax.

FIDDLES AND PHALANGES, 2: DO STRING PLAYERS HAVE LONGER LEFT FINGERS?
Eleanor Nell Stafford
MacArthur Junior High School, Jonesboro, AR

Hypothesis:<br><br>Adults who started playing a stringed instrument before age 18 will have longer left fingers than right fingers. There will be a less distinguishable difference in finger length among adults who started playing a stringed instrument after age 18.<br><br>Experiment/Procedure:<br><br>This is a two-year project where I studied the finger length of string players. I am a fiddle and guitar player. I became interested in this topic after discovering that my left fingers were longer than my right fingers. This year, I expanded my study to see if the age a person begins playing a stringed instrument influences finger length. <br><br>Data:<br><br>I surveyed stringed instrument players who are over age 18. I collected my data by measuring each subject’s middle left and middle right fingers. In order to test my hypothesis, I had to determine if the subjects had a longer left middle finger, a longer right middle finger, or if their fingers were the same length. <br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Based on my measurements, I concluded that my hypothesis is correct. Adults who started playing a stringed instrument before age 18 are likely to have longer left fingers than right fingers. 84% of the adults who began playing a stringed instrument before age 18 had longer left fingers than right. Adults who began playing after age 18 are less likely to have longer left fingers. Only 50% of them had longer left fingers than right.

STRONGYLE CONUNDRUM, YEAR THREE
Addison Thomas Hilyard
Central High School, Brooksville, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to see if Large Strongyles have been extirpated from domesticated horse populations. A feral horse population was used as a comparison. The hypothesis was: If a sample of feces from a domesticated horse is placed in a coproculture then it will have significantly less Large Strongyles than a feral horse because domesticated horses have been over treated with anthelmentics designed to target Large Strongyles. This was proven to be true. <br><br>The feral horse population that was used was the same as the previous two years. The collection sites remained the same. Two of the domesticated horses from the previous year’s study were used again in this year’s study. A single Large Strongyle was found in one of the samples from the domesticated population.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERING AMOUNTS OF CAFFEINE ON THE METAMORPHOSIS RATE OF DARKLING BEETLE LARVAE
Sarah Ana Henriquez
Atonement Academy, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of differing amounts of caffeine on the metamorphosis rate of Darkling Beetle larvae (Tenebrio molitor). Caffeine stimulates an increase in nervous activity due to its chemical effect on adenosine receptors. Additionally, caffeine has been linked to a decrease in calcium levels (as well as calcium-binding proteins), which are key factors in development. Literary research showed that caffeine inhibits the DNA repair protein at the G2/M checkpoint in mitosis (Blasina, Price, Turenne, and McGowen 1135-1138). The hypothesis was if different sets of Darkling Beetle larvae consumed increasing amounts of caffeine, then the metamorphosis rate would inversely decrease.<br><br> 50 milligram and 100 milligram caffeine caplets were crushed and dissolved in 2 milliliters of water in two separate vials. Three 50 milligram solutions were mixed into three different containers of larvae diet; the same process was applied for the 100 milligram solution in three more containers. A final set of three containers functioned as the control (i.e., no caffeine was added). Three larvae were placed in each container under a heat lamp. Daily activity of all sets was recorded.<br><br> It was observed that there were higher activity levels in the larvae that consumed 50 milligrams and 100 milligrams of caffeine. The results also showed that the Darkling Beetle larvae metamorphosis rate decreased as the amount of caffeine was increased. In conclusion, the results supported the hypothesis.

THE CHEMICAL ECOLOGY OF THE DIAPREPES ROOT WEEVIL: OLFACTORY RESPONSES TO CONSPECIFIC AND PLANT ODORS
Evan Cliff MacKay
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, FL

Citrus is a major industry, especially in Indian River County, but the trees are very susceptible to pests and disease including the Diaprepes root weevil. Adult weevils feed on the citrus leaves, but the real damage occurs during the larval stage; larvae eat the citrus roots. The current method to combat Diaprepes, pesticides, is unattractive because of toxicity, resistance, and difficulty delivering the poison to the roots where the larvae are feeding. Using pheromones has been helpful combatting many other insect species. Scientists identified a male Diaprepes pheromone that worked very well in the lab but has not been working in the field; something is missing. The two main hypotheses are that 1) the females also produce an attractant pheromone or 2) plant kairomones like carvacrol and linalool are attractants. To test this hypothesis, leaves fed upon by males (mFUF) were tested in an olfactometer against air. An olfactometer is an instrument used to precisely control odors and test the sense of smell for experiments involving pheromones. The mFUF was attractive to both males and females in a statistically significant manner, reconfirming what prior research has shown. When female fed upon leaves (fFUF) were placed in the olfactometer against pure air, fFUF was attractive to males. When fFUF was compared to mFUF each sex chose the fed upon leaves of the opposite sex. When 50 µl of the plant compounds carvacrol and linalool were tested individually against air, they were not attractive, and carvacrol did not even provoke a response. The next test was mFUF against a combination of mFUF, carvacrol, and linalool. Remarkably, the blend of odors was an attractant for both males and females; the plant kairomones worked synergistically with the pheromones in a statistically significant manner. The last test was fFUF against a blend of fFUF, carvacrol, and linalool; though it wasn’t statistically significant there was a numerical trend towards the blend. This project has two major findings; first of all, female Diaprepes produce a pheromone, and secondly plant kairomones were shown to attract weevils. This information is vital and could possibly impact the worldwide problem of the Diaprepes root weevil. Pheromones can be used for mating disruption, traps, or measurements about insect activity and possibly rid the citrus industry of a major pest.

EFFECTS OF METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON THE AVIAN PARATYMPANIC ORGAN: AN ETHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
Zoe Pierce Buccella
Home School, Barnesville, OH

The paratympanic organ, discovered by Giovanni Vitali in 1911, is a sensory structure located in the avian middle ear. Vitali hypothesized that the paratympanic organ (PTO) allows avians to detect barometric pressure fluctuation, and recent study of the organ's morphology has supported this theory (von Bartheld 1994). Although the PTO is known to respond to barometric pressure, how avians utilize the organ is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the paratympanic organ through an analysis of barometric pressure and other meteorological conditions on avian feeding patterns. The hypothesis was that low barometric pressure, an indicator of future inclement weather, would yield higher feeding rates, pointing to the possibility that the PTO plays a role in adaptive avian feeding behavior. The experiment consisted of (N=81) fifteen-minute observation sessions. During observation sessions, the number of avian visits was recorded. A visit was recorded when an avian attempted to feed from a feeding device. After all data was collected, summary statistics, single-factor ANOVA tests, and two-sample t-tests were utilized. Eight of the eleven avian species studied supported the hypothesis, displaying higher mean visitation during low barometric pressure (100,440.33 pa—101,253.06 pa). In dark-eyed slate-colored juncos (Junco hyemalis), northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and European starlings (Sturnus vugaris) this preference was statistically significant (p<0.05). The paratympanic organ has been proven to detect barometric pressure. This study opens the possibility that the organ, as an adaptive mechanism, is responding to low barometric pressure and driving increased feeding behavior prior to inclement weather.

OH, HOW YOU AFFECT MY HEART!
Samantha Rose Theriot
Houma Junior High School, Houma, LA

Problem: To determine the effects of turmeric on the heart rate of a Daphnia. <br><br>Hypothesis: If the Daphnia are exposed to turmeric then it will decrease their heart rates. <br><br>Experiment: Take three beakers and label them Control, Caffeine, Turmeric. Mix 100ml of water with 3.75mg of crushed caffeine in the beaker labeled caffeine. Mix 12ml of water with 0.2g of turmeric in the beaker labeled turmeric. Measure the amount of heartbeats in 10 seconds for Daphnia. Place all Daphnia in the caffeine solution for 25 minutes. Then measure the heartbeats for another 10 seconds, using one Daphnia at a time. Place all Daphnia in the turmeric solution for 25 minutes. Measure the heartbeats of the Daphnia for 10 seconds, placing one Daphnia at a time on the slide. Repeat steps for a second set of Daphnia. <br><br>Results: After leaving the Daphnia in the caffeine solution for 25 minutes, the first group’s average heart rate increased from 35.2 to 35.5 beats per 10 seconds. The second group’s average heart rate decreased from 33 to 26.4 beats per 10 seconds. After leaving the Daphnia in the turmeric solution for 25 minutes, the first group’s average heart rate decreased to 0.3 beats per 10 seconds. The second group’s average heart rate decreased to 0.9 beats per 10 seconds. <br><br>Conclusion: The heart rates of the Daphnia did not seem to be affected by the caffeine. On the other hand, the turmeric did seem to lower the heart rates significantly. Therefore, I accept my hypothesis. <br><br> <br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF GALLUS DOMESTICUS
Chrysta Noelle Beck
Pettisville High School, Pettisville, OH

Different strains of Gallus domesticus were studied and analyzed. Hypothesis I stated the Ross 708 X Hubbard strain will grow largest as it has two family lines that support high food efficiency and tolerance to multiple climates. Hypothesis II stated the Ross 708 X Hubbard strain will have the most desirable meat, as they won’t be affected by environment due to the strain’s genetics. Three pens with same dimensions were constructed. The pens were prepared by disinfecting each, spreading sawdust, hanging feeders, hanging lamps, and filling waterers. 25 straight-run chicks of each strain were placed in each pen. Chicks were massed weekly, and food consumption collected daily.<br><br>The Jumbo Cornish X had the largest average mass (2.62 kilograms), and the Cobb X Cobb had the smallest (2.16 kilograms). There is a significant difference in the average mass of the different strains (F=14.84; p=0.000). The Jumbo Cornish X was most efficient in converting food into body mass, and Hubbard X Ross 708 was the least efficient. Body measurements of the strains discovered Hubbard X Ross 708 breast was shorter. The Cobb X Cobb’s breast was longer. The meat with the most water retention was Cobb X Cobb. Both hypotheses were not supported. A pecking order may have developed in the flock, causing some birds to consume more.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ETHINYL ESTRADIOL ON LARVAL FORAGING BEHAVIOR AND PUPATION SITE PREFERENCES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Hannah Claire Pagels
Grove High School, Grove, OK

The possible adverse effects of endocrine disrupting compounds on wildlife and humans are the focus of much current scientific research. Documented evidence of exposure to synthetic hormones has been associated with reproductive abnormalities in animals but few studies exist on the behavioral impacts of long-term endocrine disrupting compound exposure.<br><br>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of Ethinyl Estradiol exposure on larval foraging behaviors and pupation site preferences in developing Drosophila melanogaster. The study exposed Drosophila melanogaster to the synthetic hormone Ethinyl Estradiol for seven generations in three concentrations (E=10mcg/L, E=20mcg/L, and E=70mcg/L), compared to a control. The locomotion of third in-star larval path length was observed in terms of the foraging behavior polymorphism rover (long path) and sitter (short path). Rovers and sitters were then isolated and allowed to pupate. Pupation site preferences in terms of vertical height from medium/food were recorded and analyzed.<br><br>The findings suggest that the presence of Ethinyl Estradiol does significantly impact the approximate phenotypic frequencies of the larval forage polymorphisms rovers/sitters in exposed populations when compared to the control. Evidence of variations of pupation site preferences when compared to the control was discovered in exposed populations. When larval foraging paths (rover/sitter) and pupation height were analyzed, a significant departure from previously observed studies, as well as the control, were observed.

A STUDY OF TRANSPOSITION EVENTS OF THE GYPSY RETROTRANSPOSON IN THE NEURAL CELLS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND ITS RELATION TO NEURONAL DECLINE
Trinity Russell
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous genomic components which occupy 40% of the human genome, 30% of the Drosophila genome, and a significant portion of many other eukaryotic organisms. Retrotransposons, transposable elements which amplify via RNA intermediate, have the ability to induce mutations by inserting randomly throughout chromosomal DNA. This genomic instability disrupts gene function and de novo insertions are speculated to cause over fifty reported types of human diseases. In addition, TE activation in human and Drosophila brain cells is correlated with neuronal deterioration and the aging process. However, the source of the increase in transposable element toxicity associated with the activation remains unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if de novo TE integration events resulted in elevated age-dependent expression. A novel trapping system, called the “gypsy-trap”, allowed for the visualization of transposition events through the expression of GFP. Results indicated that retrotransposons actively mobilize and proliferate throughout the genome of Drosophila melanogaster as the organism ages. This suggests the novel hypothesis that the age-dependent activation of transposable elements may disrupt functional genes and contribute to neuronal decline and disease. Transposable elements may spontaneously induce mutations which alter the regulatory and developmental phenotype, and contribute to genomic evolution. Thus it is crucial to have a thorough comprehension of their behavior with respect to mutagenesis, neuronal deterioration, and evolution. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF C. ELEGANS LIFESPAN ON RESVERATROL AND SPERMIDINE
Rohan Mabbu Prasad
Bellefontaine High School, Bellefontaine, OH

Resveratrol is an anti-microbial compound found in many natural substances including grapes, wine, and sea weed. Spermidine is a polyamine found abundantly in sperm and grapefruit. Previous studies have shown that Resveratrol and Spermidine extend the lifespan of yeast cells, fruit flies, and other model organisms. Similar results have been observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of Resveratrol and Spermidine on the lifespan of C. elegans. To measure lifespan, synchronous culturing was conducted by incubating L4 stage animals on nematode growth media (NGM). Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) was added to the NGM to inhibit reproduction. The live animals were then counted during periods of 2-7, 8-14, and 15-30 days. For treatment with Resveratrol and Spermidine, the drugs were mixed into two different NGM batches prior to incubation. Wild type (N2) and DR1309 strains were tested. DR1309, a daf-16(m26) daf-2(e1370) double mutant, was used to investigate the effects of Resveratrol and Spermidine on nematodes with decreased lifespan. Eight tests have been recorded. Descriptive analysis shows that the mean values were higher in Wild on Resveratrol and Wild on Spermidine when compared to control and mutant on Resveratrol and Spermidine. When broken down into time intervals, in the 8-15 days interval, the average wild with Resveratrol had 5.6% more living nematodes when compared with Spermidine, and mutant with Resveratrol had 11.6% more living nematodes when compared with Spermidine.

Florence High School #14-1, Florence, SD

This experiment focuses on avoidance, and more specifically anxiety. Zebrafish were novel models, due to their similar neurological makeup to humans. They were also more appropriate than humans, since the human idea of what they are scared of is so varied. Finding the avoidance response of a zebrafish was as easy as discovering their natural predator, the Indian Leaf Fish. <br><br> The student researcher hypothesized that when the specimen was presented with both allopatric and sympatric predators, it would prefer the dark, due to its habit of trying to appear still when predators are near.<br><br> The experiment started with 20 zebrafish that were put into a 20-gallon tank, and allowed 10 minutes to acclimate to the tank, so as not to overstress the specimen. Next, the student researcher incorporated a direct source of light, only illuminating one half of the tank. Finally the student researcher started the experiment by showing the four projections of the sympatric and allopatric fish, and marking the transitions of the zebrafish from the light to dark sides of the tank.<br><br> According to the data of this experiment, the zebrafish didn’t show preference for either the light areas of the experimental arena, but did show more visual reactions to the sympatric and allopatric predators than they did the harmless fish.<br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis was considered null, as they did prefer dark when presented with the projections, but when the projection was shown on the dark side, they all gathered to the light side of the tank.

THE PROFITABILITY OF BMR CORN SILAGE VS. CONVENTIONAL CORN SILAGE
Bennett Lee Gibson
Fremont High School, Ogden, UT

Profitability is a constant challenge on a dairy farm. Background research has shown that cows fed with Brown Midrib (BMR) corn silage have a higher milk production over cows fed with conventional corn silage. However, BMR hybrid seeds cost more and yield less per acre. The purpose of this project was to determine whether BMR Silage or Conventional Corn Silage is more profitable on a dairy farm of 1150 cows. This was a two part project. Part one was to find the difference in cost per pound to grow and harvest both conventional corn silage and BMR silage. Then the cost to feed one cow per day was calculated. Data showed that the BMR corn had an extra cost of $0.22 per cow per day. Part two was to find the milk production per cow when they were fed conventional corn silage, a combination of both, and finally just BMR corn silage. Data showed that the milk production per cow increased by an average of 5.65 pounds of milk per day for cows fed just BMR corn silage. The profitability was then calculated using the price per pound that is paid to the farmer for milk multiplied by the milk production rate. The extra cost for feeding BMR silage was subtracted. Calculations showed that a farmer using BMR Corn Silage will have a profit of $0.80/cow/day. On a dairy of 1000 cows, this can mean an increase of over $292,000.00 a year!

FLOATING NESTS/PLATFORMS FOR IMPROVED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE HAWAIIAN COOT (FULICA ALAI) AT PIPI‘O POND, MAPULEHU, MOLOKAI, HAWAI‘I
Sarah 'Alohilani Jenkins
Molokai High School, Ho'olehua, HI

The Hawaiian Coot (Fulica alai), endemic to Hawai‘i, is an endangered bird species. On Molokai, numerous wetlands are utilized by the Hawaiian Coot, but few are suitable nesting habitats which provide conditions that protect adults and chicks from land-based predators or other threats. This problem initiated my inquiry; Can artificial floating nests/platforms (AFNs) be used to improve Hawaiian Coot reproductive success in a mangrove forest or wetlands where no predator control is conducted? <br><br>I collected baseline data on Pipi‘o Pond, an inland fishpond located in Mapulehu, Molokai, to determine if the site was suitable for coot reproduction and to introduce AFNs. I tracked Pipi‘o Pond using GIS equipment/software to create a map of the current water line area and the surrounding mangrove forest. I calculated pond depth, pH, salinity, do, turbidity, and temperature. I documented plant and animal species including Sea pursulane (Sesuvium portulacastrum), Akiaki a native sedge, and Gambusia all of which are known as a viable food source and part of the coots’ diet. <br><br>Baseline research and months of bird observations concluded Pipi‘o Pond as a suitable nesting site. I engineered and deployed three AFNs in desirable nest locations that were inaccessible to both land-based and aerial predators and spaced to avoid territorial disputes for foraging birds. I hypothesize AFNs will improve the reproductive and fledgling success in a mangrove forest or at wetlands where no predator control is conducted. <br><br>Although Hawaiian coots were observed atop AFNs, it's inconclusive that AFNs improved reproductive and fledging success in a mangrove forest. However, as the typical mating season for coots are March-May, this may be answered through continued observations as my study progresses.

THE EFFECT OF TURMERIC ON THE MEMORY CURVES OF PLANARIANS
Supraja Shivakumar Chittari
George C. Marshall High School, Falls Church, VA

This behavioral study aimed to determine the effect of Curcuma longa (turmeric) on the memory curves of the in vivo model Dugesia dorotocephala (brown planarian). It was hypothesized that if the concentration of C. longa increased, then the D. dorotocephala ability to “learn” would increase, since C. longa contains curcumin, an antioxidant that promotes neurological repair mechanisms and protection. Specimens were exposed to 100, 150, 200, and 250 parts per million (ppm) concentrations of C. longa. The same concentrations of Capsicum annuum (red chili) powder were the negative control, and no antioxidant was the control. Through classic conditioning, total responses and response times were collected as data. C. longa gave positive results. The growth factor derived from the exponential curves of response time, from 0 – 200 ppm of C. longa, were -0.597, -0.510, -0.484, -0.451, and -0.372, respectively. The decrease indicates increasing response rate, and T-test shows statistically significant differences. The growth factors for negative control were not significantly different compared to the control. Therefore, the data supported the hypothesis of C. longa's positive effects, and blind testing further validated the results. Through a BLAST analysis, DjCHC gene, regulating neural regeneration, in D. dorotocephala was homologous to the clathrin heavy chain 1 gene in Homo sapiens, which codes for neuron-specific regulation. The GSK3 gene, involved in neural polarization and axon growth, in D. dorotocephala was homologous to the GSK3-beta gene in H. sapiens, involved in tau phosphorylation. Clustal (multiple sequence alignment) also showed motifs that should be further investigated. Therefore, C. longa may potentially be a treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

HOW DIFFERENT PESTICIDES AFFECT THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEALWORMS?
Elizabeth Ann Maack
Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

This experiment was to show the affects of pesticides on mealworms. Ten mealworms were put in to ten different containers. The containers had a base towel then 100 grams of oatmeal put on the base towel and on top were placed torn up pieces of paper towel to absorb the pesticide. They were fed either carrots or apples. There was one controlled group and three experimental groups. The controlled was sprayed with water. The experimental groups consisted of pesticides containing Deet, Deet-free, and Permethrin. The three pesticides were made into three different solutions: a full solution, a 1:10 solution, and a 1:100 solution. The containers and spray bottles were labeled according to the pesticide. Then the carrots or apples were replaced and then the containers were sprayed according to their pesticide. This was done for about four weeks and the data was collected throughout the whole experiment. The data was tested with the ANOVA test of statistical analysis. This showed that the Permethrin solutions had the most significant difference in mortality rate compared to the Water. The Deet solutions had the second most significant difference in mortality rate compared to the Water. The Deet-free solutions showed no significant difference in mortality rate compare to the Water. In conclusion the ANOVA test of statistical analysis does support the hypothesis. The hypothesis was if the insect’s growth rate or development is slower or mutated, then the pesticide could be harming other insects, ultimately the environment. The Permethrin and Deet solutions showed the most difference in mortality rate, but the Deet-free solutions showed the most mutations in the experiment.

CRYOPROTECTION: A 4 YEAR STUDY
Kyle Davis Ramsey
Navasota High School, Navasota, TX

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the rate of cooling semen will affect the motility and subsequent longevity of sperm cells before and after freezing. The success of artificial insemination (AI) programs utilizing frozen semen is dependent on the motility and longevity of the sperm. AI in sheep utilizes timed programs to synchronize estrus in the females. However, there will still be variation in the time of individual ovulation rates among ewes. If the motility and longevity can be increased, thus providing more live, active sperm cells in the system for a longer duration, there should be a higher conception rate for artificial insemination programs. Seven semen samples were collected and evaluated for motility. Four samples with a minimum of 95% motility were selected and combined together to eliminate the variation among individual animals. Extender was added to the semen and the sample was divided into 8 test groups with 2 samples for each volume. Samples were cooled using water jackets of various volumes (100ml, 400ml, 600ml, and 800ml). Samples were cooled for 3 hours and evaluated for pre-freezing motility. Samples were then frozen in pellet form using dry ice and liquid nitrogen. After freezing, samples were thawed and analyzed for post-thaw motility and longevity every 30 minutes for 8 hours. As the volume of the water jacket increased, the percent motility of the sperm cells before freezing increased. Post thaw motility was greatest when the water jacket was at least 400ml, but decreased slightly at volumes greater than 400ml. Longevity was also extended for semen cooled in the 400ml beaker. Therefore, the results show that the 400ml water jacket produced the optimum coooling rate to maximize motility and longevity.

OPTIMAL EQUINE BALANCE: APPLICATION OF BIOPHYSICS TO ASSESS AND REDUCE EQUINE INJURY
Erika Nicole Mueller
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

A common fatality in sport horses results from the fractured P2 bone (second phalanx). Some horses (eventers/jumpers) are susceptible to fracturing of the anterior P2 bone upon initial landing; however, roping/barrel racing horses are more prone to the distal P2 bone breaking due to a hyper-extension of the joints during abrupt lateral and forward accelerations. Maximum extension of the joints occurs as the hoof contacts the ground and begins forward motion while still at the zero position. High-speed cinematography was used to capture and analyze the motion of the P1 and P2 bones in identifying the specific pathology that leads to phalanx fractures. This technique can substantiate a horse’s medical predisposition and predict their maximum athletic performance. Paper reference dots were placed on all sides of horses’ front legs at the hooves, 1st and 2nd phalanxes, fetlock joints, cannon bones, knees, forearms, shoulders, and withers. Each horse was filmed three times in all gaits for both directions. Videos were imported to Logger-Pro and analyzed in MS-Excel. Velocity and acceleration tests were consistent in all trials of both horses with the most contrasting motions occurring in the 2nd phalanx. Throughout all tests, structurally correct Horse-1 exhibited a better arc and range of motion for position, velocity and acceleration than the structurally incorrect Horse-2. This method is a cost effective alternative to x-rays, which may reduce the cost of ownership for high value equines. Video analysis could substantiate an equine’s medical predisposition and even predict their maximum athletic potential.

LEPIDOPTERAN SPIRACLE VARIATION
Alina Isabella Suedbeck
Green Acres Academy, Greenville, NC

Five different Lepidopteran caterpillar species, three specimens per species, were compared using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The objective of the research was to determine if Lepidopteran caterpillar spiracles vary per species. Pictures were taken with a digital SLR camera, Stereo Microscope, and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Measurement of spiracle length, width, diameter and area was determined from stereo microscope micrographs using Adobe Photoshop measuring software. Data was analyzed using Minitab. Results showed that Lepidopteran caterpillar spiracles vary by inside structure (lamellae) and by the shape of the spiracle. One species, the Grape-Leaf-Skeletonizer, was found to be the most different of the five species. This species’ spiracles were circular instead of ovular and had branch-like structures along the perimeter that protruded out and over the spiracle cavity (confirmed using stereo-pair pictures). Another species, the Looper, was noted to have small spiracles for its body length, as well as having the least circular spiracles of the five species. The four species with the ovular spiracles varied on their lamellae design, as well as how tightly-packed their lamellae were. The first and the last spiracles on the four of the five species were slightly larger than the seven middle spiracles. It was also noted that outer lamellae structures differed from inner lamellae structures.

ANALYSIS OF CRITICAL HABITAT FOR THE SONORAN OCELOT (LEOPARDUS PARDALIS SONORIENSIS) IN THE SKY ISLAND REGION
Meagan Alanna Bethel
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Ocelots are listed solely as foreign endangered species in the U.S. despite the fact they have been observed in this country with increased frequency. Critical habitat has yet to be established. This project used four remote sensing cameras over the course of twelve months to document the existence of ocelots in the Sky Island Region and establish a critical habitat for their protection. <br><br> A total of 1,242 photos were gathered. Remote photos and other confirmed sightings documented the existence of ocelots in the Sky Island region with a significant increase from 2011 to 2012 t(5) = 3.87, p < .01. Analysis of data using GIS mapping revealed that the parameters of critical habitat were between 1,660m and 2,082m in elevation, with an average rainfall of at least 31.75cm to 45cm, and a temperature ranging from 5.5C to 12.77C in winter and 23.3C to 29.4C in summer. Ocelot sightings occurred in relationship to perennial water sources and prime vegetation consisting of Madrean Evergreen Forest Woodland, Oak-Pine Series and Encinal Oak Series. <br><br> Mapping revealed there were four primary mountain ranges where ocelots were sighted, however the data revealed that there were additional regions within the ocelots’ distribution that fit the criteria for critical habitat, including an area imminently proposed for open-pit mining. The results of this project contribute to the protection of the species by delineating the parameters of the ocelot habitat and making recommendations for the first critical habitat protection plan for Sonoran ocelots in the Sky Island region.

OLFACTORY DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN REGULAR AND DEUTERATED COMPOUNDS IN EUROPEAN HONEYBEES (APIS MELLIFERA)
Eric Samuel Epstein
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

According to the shape theory of olfaction, identically shaped odor molecules cannot be discriminated. In this study, odor differences were tested between identically shaped compounds (acetophenone or benzaldehyde) and their isotopes (deuterated acetophenone or deuterated benzaldehyde, respectively), which were either rewarded with sucrose or unrewarded. After training, European honeybees exhibited proboscis extension reflex, in anticipation of sucrose, more frequently toward the rewarded odorant than the unrewarded odorant. By discriminating between identically shaped odorants (ANOVA; highest p<0.002; F=24.1), honeybees were able to recognize odors by characteristics other than molecular shape. This finding suggests molecular vibration as an additional or alternative mechanism in odor detection.

CAN YOU "TAIL" LEFT OR RIGHT?
Michaela Lynne Cooper
Mantachie High School, Mantachie, MS

The purpose of my experiment was to study and evaluate the theology of comparative neuroscience on non-human vertebrates. The idea of this experiment was to see if one could determine what hemisphere of the brain was being used by the calculation of the angle of a dog's wagging tail as it reached its greatest point on either side. For my test subjects, I used dogs and showed them four different stimuli consisting of a treat, positive vocalization reinforced by positive body language, a newspaper supported by negative vocalization, and a playing of the sound like that of a thunderstorm. I videoed all dogs in the same environment so as to have the same result opportunity. The dogs used were from a local animal shelter, as well as my own and two friends' so as to see the difference in abused animals and family owned. The total number of dogs used was 16, and I came to the conclusion that when showed a positive stimulus, the dog's tail wagged more right, using the left hemisphere. If shown the negative, the tail was angled more left; thus using the right side. Though when presented with the thunderstorm sound, 9 of the dog's tails angled more right instead of the supposed left which only 7 demonstrated. This allowed me to draw the conclusion that a dog must be presented with visual objects in order to fully comprehend the appropriate response needed.

THE EFFECTS OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON VIRAL LOAD IN APIS MELLIFERA
Michaela Jean Fiore
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has been a problem in honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies since as early as 2006. Although there have been many other cases of population decline in hives, CCD has been the most wide spread and effects adult bees as well as brood (VanEngelsdorp, Evans & Saegerman, 2009). There are no known effective treatments for CCD. Recently beekeepers have used mixture of essential oils (including spearmint oil, lemongrass oil, and thyme oil, other oils used include ginger oil, peppermint oil, and camphor oil) that are said to lengthen the life span of infected hives. This project will look at the individual essential oils used in the beekeepers homemade mixtures and will analyze the effects of each essential oil on the viral load in honeybees. Using groups of 30 bees that are isolated from the hives, essential oils will be administered to the bees and the rate of death will be recorded throughout the experiment. After a trial is complete the viral load of the bees treated with essential oils will be calculated. This experiment will pinpoint which essential oils lower the viral load in honey bees and which oils are potentially harmful.

PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF PLANT EXTRACTS ON ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION-EXPOSED BLACKWORMS (LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATUS)
Raveena Aggarwal
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

This investigation studied the effect of various exposures of Ultraviolet radiation on blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus) cultivated in three different spices: Coriander, Cumin, and Turmeric, all of which have previously been proven to have some medical benefits. The purpose of this project is to find cost-effective ways to guard or reduce the health risks of UV radiation. The worms were placed in petri dishes with varying concentrations of the spices in the solutions. The worms were then exposed to Ultraviolet radiation on an Ultraviolet transilluminator for different time increments: 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, and 30 seconds. Finally, in 24-hour intervals from 24 hours to 72 hours after the exposure, the worms were observed for whether they were dead or alive, and data was collected in order to determine the protective effect of the plants extracts on the blackworms. Throughout the data, Coriander showed some signs of protecting the worms, but this effect was not as prominent as the other spices. Initially, Turmeric showed the highest consistency of survival since the majority of the worms had survived in Turmeric in the 24-hour data. However, Turmeric’s effects appeared to be short term because the worms cultivated in Turmeric began to drastically decrease in the 48 and 72-hour data. Overall, worms cultivated in Cumin showed a consistent survival rate because the majority of Cumin worms had survived up to the 72-hour data. Consequently, the conclusions were that Turmeric produced immediate, short-term protective effects while Cumin produced long term protective effects.

QUANTIFICATION OF ZOO ENCLOSURE SPACE USE AND BACK HAIR STANDING-UP BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE BY CAPTIVE CHACOAN PECCARY (CATAGONUS WAGNERI)
Conner Randolph Bennett
Sacred Heart Preparatory School, Atherton, CA

This study seeks to quantify zoo enclosure space utilization by the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri) and statistically analyze the animal’s back hair standing-up behavioral response to the miniature steam-powered train horn sound. The modified Spread of Participation Index (SPI) was calculated to determine the animal’s enclosure space use of unequal sized divisions. Chi-square technique is used to analyze the relationship between the train horn sound and the animal’s back hair standing-up behavioral response. Research shows the SPI will indicate imbalanced enclosure utilization while the train horn sound and Chacoan peccary back hair standing-up is not independent. The SPI was 0.267112 and indicates the animals do not use the enclosure space equally. Out of 2,172 observations, quadrant 2 had the lowest utilization measurement at 7 percent. The chi-square statistic was 271.85; DF=1; 0.05 significance level; (p < 0.01) for 2,172 observations and the data supported rejecting the null hypothesis. The hair stood up 36 times and 32 of those events (89%) were in response to the train horn. The results show there was a significant relationship between the train horn sound and back hair standing-up response. A low-cost solution to balancing enclosure utilization may include adding a small water pool in under-utilized quadrant 2. Also, installing a clear Plexiglas® sound wall where the train passes the Chacoan peccary enclosure might reduce the train horn sound decibel level. The results indicate additional research regarding Chacoan peccary enclosure utilization and back hair standing-up response to a zoo’s train horn sound is needed.

DEVELOPING A PCR TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF LYME DISEASE IN JOHNSON COUNTY, KANSAS
Nathan Alan Witters
Shawnee Mission West High School, Overland Park, KS

Ticks that are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete bacterium can transmit the bacterium to humans. Infected humans may develop Lyme disease; ticks have been transmitting the disease for hundreds of years and are the only known vector for the disease. The gene OspA is known to code for the outer surface protein A in 19 different Borrelia burgdorferi belonging to the seven OspA-serotypes 1-7 (Will et al., 1995). In this experiment, ticks were randomly selected throughout Johnson County, Kansas. First DNA was isolated, from each tick collected. Secondly, the OspA319 gene was amplified and the amplicon was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. The purpose of the project was to determine the distribution of ticks carrying Lyme disease in Johnson County, Kansas. Analysis of the agarose gels, revealed that the ticks collected were not infected with Borrelia burgdorferi.

HOW DOES OIL CONTAMINATE AFFECT THE REGENERATION PROCESS OF PROTOREASTER NODOSUS?
Kristen Michelle Burkett
Hardee Senior High School, Wauchula, FL

This project is the result of oil contaminate on the regeneration process of Protoreaster nodosus. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects that the Bp oil spill had on the marine life in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. The food chain method is used to discover the effects of the oil on the ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico. Having two tanks with three seastars in one tank recieving ten oil contaminated mysis shrimp and the three seastars in the other tank recieving ten uncontaminated mysis shrimp at each feeding. Each of the seastars all had one ray removed to have the Protoreaster nodosus begin the first stages of the regeneration process. The energetic costs of losing a ray can have a dramatic toll on Protoreaster nodosus. But in an oil spill like Bp’s, nutritional food can not be found. The results of this experiment has accepted the researcher’s hypothesis. The controlled group of seastars have regenerated indefinetly. The average percentage of regeneration for the control group was 13.83%. The experimental group of seastars’ regeneration did not do as well. The average percentage of regeneration for the experimental group was 2.73%. This shows that the oil spill would have greatly affected the ecosystem of the gulf.

JELLYFISH PHOTOTAXIS: DEVELOPING AN INFRARED NET FOR APPLICATION IN MARINE SYSTEMS FOR THE PREVENTION OF JELLYFISH FOULING AND BEACH INFESTATIONS
Connor William Burton
Camdenton R-III High School, Camdenton, MO

Jellyfish are responsible for 50,000 envenomations annually (Daubert, 2012). Additionally, some coastal power plants spend an estimated $50,000 per year to remove jellyfish from intake pipes (Poorter n.d.). Scyphozoan jellyfish represent a large part of these damages. Scyphozoans possess Ocelli which are simple eyes that can detect changes in light which they use to respond (termed phototaxis) to diurnal patterns in their natural habitat. The premise behind this project is to determine whether jellyfish respond to both visible and Infrared light. If jellyfish are phototaxic, then it is conceivable that such a device could be developed to reduce jellyfish-human interactions. <br><br>To test this hypothesis, I constructed three waterproof devices which use narrow-band LED’s to emit light at three different wavelengths; one visible and two Infrared (850 nm and 940 nm). These devices were tested on Moon Jellyfish and Sea Nettles at a public aquarium to determine their potential to be used as an Infrared ‘net’ to deter jellyfish.<br><br>Results of testing indicate that Aurelia aurita shows a statistically significant attraction to Infrared light, as well as a significant tendency to migrate vertically to orient in visible light. With this in mind, it is considered at least feasible that a system of directionally-oriented Infrared lights could be positioned to act as an Infrared ‘net’ to deter jellyfish from sensitive areas.<br><br>

FACTORS INFLUENCING CANINE MAMMARY NEOPLASIA
Morni Ashish Modi
Caddo Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

The purpose of this research project was to analyze the effects of spaying in female dogs on the occurrence of type of mammary tumors and mortality in a large multicenter trial. It was hypothesized that intact females would have increased risk of developing malignant mammary tumor compared to spayed female. Data on 704 dogs from 18 different sites were collected and analyzed. Two of the sites had over 200 patients. Information pertaining to: breed, date of birth, age at the time of diagnosis, weight, ovarian hysterectomy status (was the dog spayed previously), surgery date, length of stay in hospital, tumor type (benign/ malignant), pathology results, and their survival status were collected. A statistical analysis was then performed using the SAS system to assess a significance of ovarian hysterectomy on development of type of tumor and their survival. Results revealed the following findings: (1)There were higher malignant mammary tumors in non-spayed group compared to the spayed group (73.68% vs. 65.95%, P Value of 0.05). (2) Overall mortality in the non-spayed group was higher compared to spayed group (24.9% vs. 5.3%. p<0.01). (3) In the subgroup of benign tumors, mortality was higher in non-spayed compare to spayed group (18.83% vs. 3.0%, p<0.01).(4)In the subgroup of malignant tumors, mortality was higher in non-spayed compare to spayed group (27.2% vs. 6.44%, p<0.01). These findings suggest that spaying improves mortality in patient with mammary tumor irrespective of type and spayed dogs are less likely to develop malignant mammary tumors.

EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON THE FILTRATION RATES OF THE BLUE MUSSEL MYTILUS EDULIS
Meagan Elizabeth Currie
Greely High School, Cumberland, ME

The goal of these experiments is to establish how environmental stressors affect the filtration rates of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. Mytilus is regarded as the global indicator species used to detect Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The mussels ingest toxic algae, the levels of which are measured to determine how severe the bloom is.<br><br> This experiment involved two different tests. The mussel filtration rates were measured over time after the mussels were kept in a low nutrient environment for two weeks, or after exposure to 2,4-D (a widely used herbicide). The filtration rate was established by putting a set amount of graphite in a set volume and measuring the rate at which the mussels cleared the water. Graphite concentration was quantified by measuring the absorbance levels of solution via spectrophotometry. Rates were compared to unexposed control mussels. Nutrient-deficient mussels cleared the water on average 28% more slowly. This was significantly different from controls with a T test p-value of 0.021. The second set of tests exposed the mussels to 1.0 part per million (ppm) and 10.0 ppm of the pollutant 2,4‐dicholorphenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The absorbance readings were significantly different from controls (0.018 and 0.003 respectively for the two concentrations), which demonstrates a significant difference between the control mussel filtration rates and those subjected to environmental stressors. Possible implications are a decrease in the health of mussels if environmental stressors are present, and a decrease in the accuracy of the current Red Tide detection test.

AVIAN MIMICRY IN COLOR SPACE
Uri Rosenshine
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

I analyzed the plumage colors of two clades of South American Ramphastos toucans in order to verify the interspecific social dominance mimicry (ISDM) game-theory model for two-party evolutionary mimicry. The model establishes that under circumstances wherein a subordinate and a dominant group are competing sympatrically for the same resources, the subordinate group may evolve to mimic the dominant group. The purpose was to empirically confirm or reject this model. To that end, the plumage colors of the subordinate channel-keel-billed croaking and the dominant smooth-billed yelping Ramphastos toucan clades were compared. I hypothesized that the data would confirm the ISDM model. I used a tetrahedral color-space, which models the avian perception of a color based on the stimulation of the four avian retinal color cone types: red, blue, green, and ultraviolet. Each vertex of the tetrahedron represents one of the four color cones and a color is expressed as a vector in the color-space with the spherical coordinates theta, phi, and r, where theta and phi indicate color hue and r indicates color saturation. This analysis was performed on the two Ramphastos clades, and the color-space occupancies of the plumages of the distinct groups were analyzed to evaluate the degree of mimicry. The mimic croaker toucans were found to be highly convergent on the model yelper toucans, and the results confirmed the game-theory model. This work contributes to the development of the tetrahedral color-space as a tool for evaluating visual perception and expands our understanding of mimicry as an evolutionary mechanism.

INSPECT: IDENTIFYING MEMORY ENCODING NEURONS THROUGH SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
Amanpreet Singh Kandola
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

An important goal in neuroscience is to identify the neurons and circuits relevant to the formation of memories in the brain. This knowledge is instrumental to our understanding of the human brain and to the treatment of cognitive decline. In this study, I developed novel image analysis software (InSPECT, Imaging neurons through Spectral Analysis) to identify neurons that may have encoded the memory of a spatial task. InSPECT analyzed the expression of PARP-1, an enzyme that regulates gene expression, and its enzymatic product (PAR) in hippocampal neurons of mice trained to learn the spatial task and control untrained mice. Images of PARP-1 and PAR expression were previously obtained via immunohistochemical methods and confocal microscopy. InSPECT first identified unique patterns present only in the neurons from trained animals, which were potentially associated to the learned experience. Next, using a threshold model based on the above data, we determined that 20-30% of the neurons examined in trained mice were likely to have been recruited by the learning experience. Using InSPECT we identified this subset of neurons amidst the total population. In sum, InSPECT was developed to identify neurons within a network involved in a memory task. It is encouraging to think similar efforts can help increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory through identification of differential molecular expression. Based on the same principle, this software could also be used to identify abnormal molecular activity in cells in distinct pathological conditions, generalizing InSPECT's impact to many fields of scientific inquiry.

INFLUENCE OF THE NUMBER OF ESTROUS CYCLES OF HEIFERS BEFORE EXPOSURE TO BREEDING ON PREGNANCY RATE AND BREED BACK RATE IN BOS TAURUS
Jaclyn Nicole Ketchum
Carter County High School, Ekalaka, MT

The effect of number of estrous cycles expressed by heifers before breeding on pregnancy rate was determined. Blood samples were collected by tail venipuncture every 9-11 days and then tested for progesterone levels. Estrous cycles were identified by peaks in progesterone levels. Heifers were then grouped into estrous cycle groups, based on the number of 21 days intervals (representing average duration of an estrous cycle) from puberty to exposure to breeding. Prepubertal heifers had lower pregnancy rates (83.08%) compared to those that were exposed to breeding after their first estrous cycle (89.18%) and after their second estrous cycle (90.55%) (P < 0.05). <br><br>The effect of number of estrous cycles expressed before breeding as a heifer on pregnancy success after calving was also determined. Heifers that were pregnant were then exposed to breeding as cows the following year and pregnancy success was determined. Cows that exhibited two or more estrous cycles before start of breeding as heifers had better pregnancy rates (72.88%) compared to those that had only experienced one estrous cycle (61.03%) and those that were prepubertal (52.86%) (P < 0.05). <br><br> There are factors that affect pregnancy rates. Pubertal status and number of estrous cycles heifers have had before the onset of breeding was shown here to have a major effect on these traits. By determining that exposing heifers to breeding that are prepubertal or recently pubertal results in lower pregnancy rates, cattle producers will now be able to take that knowledge and apply it to their operations.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if acceleration has a negative impact on ants, measured in the time it takes to forage for food. These observations will help scientists decide whether ants are a potential species choice when planning future space stations with indoor and simulated outdoor areas. The ants were timed in a maze containing food to determine how long it took non-accelerated ants to find the food source. The same ants were accelerated in a model payload rocket reaching approximately 1500 feet then immediately retested in an identical maze. The particular species of ant chosen forages individually with subsequent antennal communication at the colony. This may have biased the experiment as the ants had to be removed upon finding food and communication was not allowed. Multiple groups of ants were tested in this manner to obtain pre and post-acceleration averages. The experiment resulted in faster post-acceleration times overall disproving the hypothesis that pre-accelerated ants would find food faster. The difference in time between pre and post accelerated ants was 15 minutes 58 seconds. The characteristics exhibited were similar to those exhibited by humans such as disorientation and sluggishness. The contributions are two-fold. First since ants breathe similarly to humans, studying acceleration effects on ants helps us to better understand the effects on humans. Lastly, ants are significant and necessary to all environments due to their debris clean-up, pollination and bug population control therefore a scientist would be negligent in not including ants in environment planning.

VALIDATION OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT 1 GENE SEQUENCE AS A GENETIC MARKER IN THE RED SEA
Ammar Yasser Alkhouli
Dar Althiker School, Jeddah, SAUDI ARABIA

87% of the world’s fisheries are considered either fully exploited and do not promise an increase in production, or overexploited and may be salvaged if proper management programs are employed. This study aims to develop a rapid and accurate method based on the latest genomic techniques to assess fish abundance-levels in the Red Sea through DNA barcoding. A previous validation of the use of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequence as an identification marker is necessary. A small section of the caudal fin was excised from 112 fish samples from various locations in the Red Sea and DNA was extracted from each of these samples using the Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl Alcohol extraction method. The COI gene was later amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, and thereafter sent to Sanger Sequencing. Consensus sequences were produced using Geneious and individuals corresponding to the same species collected from different locations showed more similar profiles than individuals corresponding to close related species collected at the same site. Therefore, proving that a COI-based identification system could be used for assessing stock and diversity of Red Sea marine life. This provides critical information for the continuation of the project where 454 pyrosequencing will be used to determine the biomass and composition of complex large sample composed by ichthyoplankton, using the COI gene to assess the diversity. This technique will expedite the process of obtaining more accurate fisheries research.

IDENTIFICATION OF NEW SPECIES OF BLUE PIGMENTED COPEPODS IN THE RED SEA
Hanan Adel Wali
Dar Alfikr School, Jeddah, SAUDI ARABIA

Blue pigmented copepods (microscopic organisms) are among the most diverse animals on the planet. There are almost 260 different species of copepods and more are being discovered in the Red Sea. The blue color helps them protect against strong solar radiations (ultraviolet), therefor copepods protect marine organisms beneath the surface of the Red Sea. The study’s goal was to identify the diverse blue-pigmented copepods from the Red Sea and to analyze the protein that enables them to absorb the sunlight. Different environments and areas were considered in collecting samples such as sun light exposure and depth. Three hundred samples were identified by morphological taxonomic identification using microscopy and DNA sequencing of mitochondrial (mtCOI) gene. Different types of analysis were conducted using BLASTn analysis, multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysis. According to the analysis, the DNA barcodes of six samples didn’t exceed 81% comparing to the existing barcodes which indicates same genus but different species, and two of the samples had 0% matching which indicates different genus and species. This study had generated eight DNA barcodes of the unknown species that can be added to the NCBI database. In conclusion, the Red Sea harbors unidentified species of genera Acartia, Labidocera and Sapphirina. Such proteins found in the new species can be applied in medicine and various treatments.

THE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE OF CULEX MOSQUITO SURVIVORSHIP
Nicolas Quinn Wolnick
Summit High School, Bend, OR

While many harmful environmental insecticides exist, previous research from Brazil suggests that caffeine limits survivorship of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Laranja, A., et. al., 2006). My experiment focused on Culex mosquitoes and the effect of various caffeine concentrations in the water they were developing in. The caffeine concentrations tested were 20 grams/Liter, 2 grams/Liter, and 0.2 grams/Liter, and larval survivorship was recorded over twenty days. In the 20 grams/Liter solution, every one of the 48 mosquito larvae in eight different chambers died within 24 hours. In the first 48 hours of exposure to the 2 grams/Liter solution, only one of the 48 mosquito larvae remained alive. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggests that increasing concentrations of caffeine in water significantly reduced mosquito survival time (Wilcoxon survival analysis, p<.0001). During the first four days, there was no significant difference in survivorship between the 0 grams/Liter (Control) and 0.2 grams/Liter solutions (t-test, p>0.05). However, for the remainder of the experiment, the survivorship of the control was significantly higher than the 0.2 grams/Liter exposures (t-test, p<0.05). Ultimately, 35% (17/48) of the control treatment larvae metamorphosed into adult mosquitoes while none of the caffeine treatment larvae reached adulthood. Through the use of high performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that soaking used coffee grounds in 19°C water yielded an average caffeine concentration of 2.2 grams/Liter. My findings suggest the caffeine in used coffee grounds has the potential to be used as an insecticide against mosquitoes after considering the effects of caffeine on other organisms.

MAXIMIZING THE EFFICIENCY OF AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS IN CHICKENS
Nitish Peela
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

Antibiotics have been used as growth promoters in chickens since the 1980s. The primary antibiotics used are Streptomycin and Bacitracin. The maximum efficiency of antibiotics is not being met because the antibiotics kill off the entirety of the natural gut flora (beneficial bacteria) in the chickens’ intestines. By feeding the chickens an antibiotic resistant supplement of gut flora (a probiotic) such as L. Rhamnosus, the side effects should be minimized and the efficiency of the antibiotic increases. However, introducing a resistance gene into the environment is risky as DNA may transfer to pathogenic strains of bacteria through conjugation. Mutagenesis was performed to create a natural strain which had no transferrable resistance. This was done by engineering the bacteria to develop resistance in the chromosome rather than the plasmid. The engineered antibiotic resistant probiotic was fed to chickens. Forty-eight chickens were tested on in total; 8 were control, 8 were probiotic, 8 were antibiotic, 8 were the combination, and 16 were tested at a higher concentration of antibiotic. Results suggest that the antibiotic + probiotic group grew 25% than the antibiotic group and 50% bigger on than the control group. Statistical analysis was performed to demonstrate that each group was significant (P<0.05) with respect to the control group. Since the chickens grow by 25%, agribusiness gets about 400 grams higher yield per chicken due to this medication. Economic analysis reveals that this is a gain of approximately $0.95/chicken.

A NOVEL STUDY ON THE “SAFER SUBSTITUTE”: EVALUATING THE BEHAVIORAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS OF BPA AND BPS ON THE C. ELEGANS MODEL
Bansri Manesh Patel
Sussex Technical High School, Georgetown, DE

Behavioral and developmental disorders are on the rise globally, raising concerns about the potential contribution of neuroendocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol A (BPA), and its replacement, Bisphenol S (BPS). Primarily found in polycarbonate plastic bottles, BPA has been associated with wide-ranging, adverse health effects. Although BPS is being used as a replacement for BPA in many consumer products, its effects are not yet well understood. This novel study is the first one to assess the health effects of BPS. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model organism, the effects of BPA and BPS on habituation and embryonic development were investigated at the physiologically relevant dose of 1 mM. Habituation assays were conducted to assess a form of non-associative learning. Embryonic development was assessed using DAPI staining. The data reveals that the developing embryo is vulnerable to behavioral impairments in non-associative learning, following exposure to BPA and BPS. Compared to controls, habituation rates were nearly 50% slower in worms exposed to BPA, and up to 33% slower in worms exposed to BPS, suggesting interference with dopaminergic neurons and their synapses. Though high embryonic lethality was observed in both BPA- and BPS-exposed C. elegans populations, gross anatomical anomalies were not observed. In this study, BPS was found to have many of the same biological effects as BPA. Considering that BPS is being used as a substitute in BPA-free products, it underscores the importance of further study in helping to determine the overall safety of its usage in consumer products.

EVOLUTIONARY EFFECTS ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF FALL ARMY WORM, SPODOPTERA FRUGIPERDA (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE) ON ARTIFICIAL DIET COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL AND TRANSGENIC CORN
Manuela Jojoa-Portilla
Cleveland High School, Cleveland, MS

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda is one of the most important pests of maize. To control this insect, transgenic corn has been developed and used since 2000. There are several varieties of genetic corn, but Cry1FBT is the most efficient to control FAW. Innumerable studies of Bt resistance have been done, however there still is an interrogation on the susceptibility to the Bt proteins. The purpose was to evaluate the adaptation of FAW to artificial diet and how the voracious eating habit and high growth rates of FAW changes when comparing its reproductive habits among its traditional and transgenic maize. The rejection of FAW to its natural host was observed by several growth disruptions after the fourth instar was fed with Non-Bt and Bt corn and also with fifth instar which showed low population growth rates in the surviving adults and no offspring was obtained for the second generation. The FAW had a net reproductive rate of 240.17± (SE) 57.3 female / female which is 8.2-fold higher when compared with FAW reared on Non-Bt corn (29.01±4.56) or 60-fold higher than FAW reared on Bt corn (3.92±2.32). The interval that separates the births of one generation of the next was 4 days shorter in diet than it was in Non-Bt and 3 days shorter that it was in Bt corn. The intrinsic and finite rates of increase were higher in insects reared on diet which gives an estimation on how this pest duplicates its population.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN RESOURCE USAGE AND REGENERATION AND POPULATION SIZE USING COMPUTATIONAL MODELING
Gregory Vitalyevich Rassolov
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to use a simulation model to investigate the dependence of populations on the availability of resources, on the degree of interaction between organisms in the population, and on initial population density. The sustainability of populations due to limitations in available resources and the resulting movement of organisms was a key component in determining the characteristics of the population. To conduct the experiment, a program was written in FORTRAN 77 based off of an earlier program, written for the preceding project. The program was iterated until stability of the population was reached. It was hypothesized that the fewer the resources that were available to the population, the more slowly resources regenerated, or the lower the initial population density, the more likely the population would be to crash and die off. It was also hypothesized that with more virulent disease, the more detrimental greater interaction between organisms would be; if disease was less of a factor, the less detrimental a greater degree of interaction would be. This was due to the fact that a greater range of interaction yielded a higher number of possible mates and a greater ability to relocate in case of resource depletion, but also made the rapid transmission of disease more possible. The data of population size over time was analyzed for several levels of each variable tested, and correlation tests were performed using exponential, Gaussian, hyperbolic, and hyperbolic tangent functions; resulting correlation coefficients supported the hypotheses.

DO CHICKENS HAVE A PREFERENCE ON THE COLOR OF FOOD THEY EAT?
Lauren Ashley Harper
Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science, Manahawkin, NJ

Domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), have tetra-chromatic vision, which allows them to see ultraviolet light in addition to the red, green, and blue of human vision. A chicken’s behavior and emotion correlates with colors, such as the color red creates an instinctive behavior and aggressive emotion. The relationship could be useful in formulating effective feed. A y-maze, in conjunction with dyed chicken food, determined chickens feeding preferences. Tests checked preference (using small rations) and avoidance (using large rations). The chicken was more attracted to the colors red and yellow and least attracted to the color blue. These results can be used for dying chick starter, medication, or water different colors, such as red or yellow, to reduce mortality from dehydration and starvation. This could also be used as an alternate method for meat producers to grow a healthy flock, without the use of hormones, which force hunger upon the animals. Two of the coloration preference tests also involved wild birds that came to the test site. The wild birds were also found to prefer the colors red and yellow with a raised liking of the color green. An alternate test that was solely conducted on the wild birds used suet and a dyed center. The results of the five day suet data collection show that the birds were eating more out of the dyed center of the red and yellow samples. This information could be used to dye backyard birdfeeders and birdhouses to attract different birds to the establishments.

THE EFFECTS OF SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ON POGONOMYRMEX OCCIDENTALIS ACTIVITY
Ashley Maye Hamlin
Hilton Head Island High School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Ants are beneficial to an ecosystem as they act as decomposers, pollinators, and distributors of seeds and nutrients. Their tunnels allow air and moisture to circulate around roots. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on the activity of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis (western harvester ants). In particular, the rate of tunneling in agar gel was compared for the control groups in normal gravity to the colonies in the microgravity simulated by a horizontal clinostat. Based upon results from NASA’s STS-107 experiments, it was hypothesized the ants in the simulated microgravity would have a slower initial tunneling rate. The experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis; the initial tunneling rate was slower in the microgravity environment, but after several days, the tunneling rate approached that of the ants in the control groups. Although simulation of microgravity by using a horizontal clinostat has limitations, it is much more economical than actual space flight and extensive experimentation may be conducted with a modest apparatus. This method may be used to study the behavioral tendencies of organisms when exposed to long term microgravity.

NEMATODE TROPHIC GROUP DISTRIBUTIONS IN DIFFERENT HABITATS
Sang-A Yun
West Lafayette Junior/Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

Plant-feeding nematode area trophic group causes major losses in forests and crops. To observe the growth of nematodes populations, 40 samples of nematodes were extracted from soil samples taken from conventionally managed agriculture, organically managed agriculture, forest, and grassland. 200cc was taken from the nematode solution to be emptied onto a microscope slide. The nematodes were counted and sorted into their respective species. This was repeated twice for each field. The grassland had a much higher abundance of plant parasites than other sites. On average, the grassland site had about 82 plant parasites compared to 23, 14, 37 plant parasites in organic agriculture, conventional agriculture, and forest respectively. Organically managed agriculture had more bacterivores than fungivores, probably because the soil had a high ratio of nitrogen to carbon. On average, the organic agriculture site had about 80 bacterivores compared to 41, 41, 46 bacterivores in conventional agriculture, forest, and grassland respectively.Nematodes are relevant in measuring the quality of soil, as greater bacterivore concentration indicates higher quality soil while greater plant parasite concentration indicates lower quality soil. A follow-up experiment would be to distribute nematodes into species to see if some species are more abundant than others, obtain more samples from different sites to see a trend, or to do an analysis of soil property to see if the quality of soil with more plant-parasitic nematodes is poorer.

TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY REGULATING COLD SENSITIVITY IN C. ELEGANS
Michael Shao
Detroit Country Day Upper School, Beverly Hills, MI

Acute cold is important to animal survival as temperature plays an important role in metabolism, lifespan, and other physiological phenomena in animals. I conducted an experiment to discover the neurons associated with cold sensation using the nematode C. elegans. I am using C. elegans as a model to study neuroscience because it has a simple and compact nervous system and it is easy to manipulate, observe, and cultivate in large numbers over a short span of time. The purpose of the project is to find the neural and molecular mechanisms responsible in mediating the sensitivity of cold in C. elegans. I have devised an assay and built my own testing chamber that can test this cold sensitivity in the nematode. I analyzed data based on the number of head swings the worms make to quantify my data. I tested different temperatures (4C-20C) with different mutants of worms which were possible candidates for sensing cold temperatures. I knew that a neuron is responsible when a mutant reacts differently or defectively to the cold stimulus. Discovering exactly how animals can sense cold temperatures in their bodies can greatly increase further experimentation possibilities based on this circuitry. I found that the CNG channels in the AFD neuron were responsible for sensing the cold temperatures. This new understanding also helps increase the understanding of all animals with these neurons, which can eventually be translated to the human body, where we can develop mechanisms or medicines to target these specific areas of the body and manipulate behavioral or sensory activity in many organisms.

TESTING THE CEPHALIC ADHESIVE ORGAN HYPOTHESIS IN CYPRINID PROTOLARVAE
George Eugene Maurakis
Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill, Midlothian, VA

An adhesive organ is a prominent, protruding mucous secreting gland allowing newly hatched tadpoles and post-hatch larvae of some fishes to attach to aquatic vegetation. The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that protolarvae of Hybognathus hankinsoni, Notemigonus crysoleucas, Carassisus auratus, Cyprinus carpio, and Scardinius erythrophthalalmus (Cyprinidae) contain adhesive glands on their heads. The hypothesis is if newly hatched larvae of phytophilous species attach to aquatic vegetation, then they have adhesive glands. Independent variables are the different species of fishes. Dependent variables are the presence of adhesive organs, epithelial pores, and mucous on heads of protolarvae of the fishes. Protolarvae of Semotilus corporalis and Semotilus thoreauianus, which do not attach to submerged aquatic vegetation, were used as the control. SEM examination of specimens indicated there were no adhesive organs on the control species (S. corporalis), or H. hankinsoni, N. crysoleucas, C. auratus, C. carpio, and S. erythrophthalamus. The hypothesis that if newly hatched protolarvae of the phytophilous species attach to aquatic vegetation, then they have adhesive organs, is rejected. Both SEM and light microscopy indicated the absence of adhesive organs on all areas of heads of all protolarvae. Although test species did not have adhesive organs, all of them had both epithelial pores and mucous. The control species (S. corporalis) only had epithelial pores but no mucous. Light microscopy indicated that the control species (S. thoreauianus) had a two cell-thick epidermis. In contrast, the epidermis of N. crysoleucas was about three to four cell layers thick.

THE EYES BEHIND AN OPHIUROIDEA
Cathleen Teresa Mestre, Ana Carlsen
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Ophiuroidea (common name: brittle stars) are part of the echinoderm class. They are nocturnal so they spend most of their time under rocks. When escaping from their predator they will detach one of their arms. They will also lose an arm if it gets caught or torn. Though they are in the same phylum Echinodermata, they are separated from sea stars and placed in a class of their own, Ophiuroidea. This experiment tested the optic tissue sensitivity to various forms of light. Fifteen specimens were collected and placed in a homemade environment. Each Ophiurid was tested using white, blue, red light, and no light. Once tested the specimens were returned to their natural habitat. The hypothesis stated that there would be a reaction in light with the greatest reaction occurring with white light. The expected movement is observed with the no light as the control tests. Chi square analysis was performed to determine if the observed movement values in the different scenarios of light were significantly different to the expected movement values when there is no light present. Based on the Chi-square analysis the null hypotheses were rejected, therefore the experimental hypotheses were supported.

Sericulture industry is designed for countryside development offering subsidiary occupation to the rural people and extending employment to the local workforce. Its success as a livelihood project depends on the nutrition of silkworm and other hygienic practices. For this reason, sufficient quality mulberry leaves should be supplied to meet the normal development of the organism. <br><br>Six hundred grown silkworms were used as test specimen. Bioassay of silkworm was conducted after thoroughly disinfecting the rearing house with 5% calcium hypochlorite and 2% formalin solutions. They were fed with the desired leaf age and preparation at three normal feeding schedules (4 a.m., 10 a.m., 3 p.m.), except at night (8 p.m.) when ascorbic acid – enriched mulberry leaves were administered as required by the formulated treatments (1%, 2% and 3% ascorbic acid solution).<br><br>Improvements were observed in the larval parameter, single cocoon weight, silk thread reel ability, and filament length at all concentrations of the ascorbic acid (AA) solutions. Maximum increase was observed at 2% AA for the larval parameter (4.97 g), single cocoon yield (0.13 g), raw silk thread % (4.94%), and filament size (0.10 denier). No effect was observed on the single shell weight. The silk filament length showed concentration dependent effect with an increase of 59.79 m at 3% AA.<br><br> This research information on silkworm rearing is an option to sericulture farmers who could not produce quality mulberry leaves for their silkworm nutrition.

A STUDY ABOUT THE NEST RELATED SOCIAL BEHAVIORS OF ANTS
Shiqi Chen, Jingyi Wang, Xiaotian Wang
The High School Affiliated to Shanghai University, Shanghai, CHINA

Objects: to investigate the relationship between the nest structure and social behaviors of ants.<br><br>The ants are highly social insects, the structure of ant nest is complex, what’s the nest related social behaviors. To answer this question, the soil freezing CNC milling and computer synthesis approaches were combined to investigate the characteristics of nests of Iridomyrmex anceps, transmittance higher seaweed gel was employed as a matrix to study nesting behavior of Iridomyrmex anceps, gas chromatograph was further used to monitor the changes of pheromone during nesting. The gypsum composite materials were used to build artificial nests to observe the ant nesting process and other behavior in the nests.<br><br>We found that: 1) The ants have the wisdom of ants on the observation of the natural terrain and super building capacity. 2) The ants will follow a specific program and principle to build their nests. For example, the queen will start nesting in the very early stage, then the worker ants will finish the left parts. New pheromone is formed during nesting. Ants have a special depth perception. 3) The ants do not necessarily build their own nests,if there is a suitable space, they will further use and modify it. 4) Ants have special, standardized processing procedures for the death of a member of their family. We speculate that the pheromone may be related to the identification of corpse. Our results therefore suggest that there are some social behaviors related to nest structures.

LIGHT, CO2 LEVEL AND FOOD LIMITATION AS EXOGENOUS FACTORS AFFECTING DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION IN BOSMINA LONGIROSTRIS
Daisuke Murakami, Chisato Tanaka
Nagasaki Prefectural Nagasaki Nishi High School, Nagasaki, JAPAN

Strong diel vertical migration (DVM) of water flea, Bosmina longirostris, is observed in our local pond. The DVM in this pond is characterized by spending daylight hours in deep water and rising toward the surface at night. However, the strength and underlying mechanisms of the DVM remain to be clarified.<br><br> <br><br>We developed a transparent acrylic pipe to examine the effects of light and water conditions on DVM. To analyze phototaxis and gravitaxis, B. longirostris were placed in the pipe, and migration in response to light of various wavelengths under various CO2 concentrations was examined. Sensitivity to 390-nm light was observed in B. longirostris and negative phototaxis was exhibited under conditions of low CO2 (<7 ppm). In darkness, negative gravitaxis was observed under conditions of high CO2 (>=7 ppm), while positive gravitaxis was observed under low CO2 (<7 ppm).<br><br> <br><br>Next, we prepared 6.5-m-high water tanks and placed them directly in the pond to monitor DVM under the various water conditions with induced food limitation. Interestingly, migration of B. longirostris toward the surface at night was strongly induced for pond water collected from a depth of 5 m compared to that collected from a depth of 0 m. Additionally, stronger upward migration was observed with spring water than with pond water.<br><br> <br><br>In this work, the following exogenous factors were found to affect DVM in B. longirostris: (i) daytime short-wavelength light exposure leads to downward migration and (ii) nighttime high CO2 exposure and food limitation in pond water induce upward migration.

HOW COLD EXPOSURE AFFECTS THE EXPRESSION OF TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE IN LYRE CRABS (HYAS LYRATUS)
Erin Gaffaney, Anna Thompson
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

To determine whether cold exposure affects the expression of TPS in lyre Crabs, RNA was isolated from tissues of crabs exposed to both cold and ambient seawater. cDNA was made from the isolated mRNA, and RT-PCR was used to isolate and replicate the gene. Then agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine whether the TPS gene was expressed. <br><br> PCR was performed using primers developed for blue crab TPS. The gel we ran after PCR showed no TPS gene was isolated. We determined that the lack of an amplified TPS gene could have been due to the primer that we used. Because the primer used was specific to blue crabs, there is a possibility that even though the TPS gene is highly conserved between other species, the phylogenetic separation between blue crabs and lyre crabs made for difference in the TPS gene.<br><br> We also extracted hemolymph from the crabs that were acclimated to both temperatures before and after acclimation to test levels of glucose and trehalose. Our data regarding the hemolymph showed temperature had no statistical effect on trehalose and glucose concentrations. Last year’s research showed that increased temperature decreased trehalose concentrations, so our current data suggests below 3°C crabs reach a threshold, where they will not produce more trehalose.<br><br> Our results are important because trehalose is an important carbohydrate in transgenic organism research, cryogenics, and organ transplants. Understanding how trehalose functions in species that uses it as a primary blood sugar helps us better understand its significance to humans.

Research analysis on the features of families of Korean butterflies based on their veins.<br><br>During classifying the butterflies, we realized that their wings of colors, patterns, even the vein are different. <br><br> In this study, we analyzed and classified about 72 species of Korean butterflies' vein. We bleached the butterflies' wings to observe more closely.<br><br>Through this way, we studied similarities and differences of butterfly’s veins and made the tree based on characters of their veins.<br><br> The result of this study follows like this ; There were some similarities and differences in the subfamily. Those results were important to identify the phylogenetic relationship of butterflies' veins. <br><br> The wings of insects cannot be found in other animals, and wings are very unique and distinctive. All wings have different sizes and shapes, but, it can identify by veins. Also, all the species of butterflies have similarities and differences about veins. We think this is one of important an object of study to classify them. Therefore, it is expected to be able to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of similarities through each butterflies' veins.

After finding mosquito larvae move backward using their tails unlike other aquatic insects, we tried to reveal the retro propulsion principle scientifically. In addition, we intended to find out the gradual process of mosquito larvae’s backward motion which is not found yet and suggest a biomimetic direction from special organs and motion of mosquito larvae. <br><br>As a result, we observed that mosquito larvae can move in both forward and backward directions and the patterns that they move their tails vary according to the moving direction. When moving forward, similar to other aquatic insects, they wiggled their tails and heads side to side between 30˚and 40˚. While, when moving backward, their tails turned in the opposite direction of heads quickly. We monitored a peculiar backward. <br><br> While, when moving backward, their tails turned in the opposite direction of heads quickly. We monitored a peculiar backward motion of mosquito larvae with a superhigh speed camera (1/1000 sec). The examination led to the discovery of the following gradual motion paths. <br><br>we found that mosquito larvae push water off only toward their heads without pushing water off toward their tails by controlling the surface area of water exclusion organs when turning their tails. Also, We analyzed that the reason why the body of a mosquito larva does not turn despite quick turn of its tail is that a mosquito larva rolls its body by moving its head first before gaining a momentum with the tail.

REPRODUCTION OF MUTATED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER WITH NON-MUTATED ONES (SECOND PHASE)
Joshua Abel Rivera, Darlene Gonzalez
Brigida Alvarez Rodriguez, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

The Drosophila melanogaster, well known as “fruit fly”, has been used in many studies because of its short life cycle, which consist of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The purpose for this investigation is to study the reproduction of mutant fruit flies with non-mutated ones. The hypothesis was, if fruit flies survive in an acid pH level and mutate it will not be able to reproduce with non-mutated fruit flies.<br><br>A breeding ground of mashed banana was prepared to attract the flies. Seven milliliters of mashed banana were placed in each of four test tubes. Forty drops of lemon were added to each of two tubes until an acid level (pH 4) was obtained. Mutations are expected to occur in this acid habitat. The other two tubes were used as a control group with a pH level of 6-7. Eight fruit flies in larva stage were put in each of four test tubes; for a total of 32 flies. After the larvae developed into adults, the surviving ones were separated by gender and their mutations were observed and recorded. Then they were all placed in a new container with a pH level of 5 in order to adapt all flies to an acid medium habitat with a mashed banana, which served as food and habitat, to observe the reproduction between the mutated flies and the non-mutated ones. It was concluded that mutant Drosophila melanogaster cannot reproduce with a non-mutated Drosophila melanogaster. They cannot reproduce among themselves either.

EFFECT OF SALINITY LEVELS ON THE REPRODUCTION PROCESS OF ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA
Denzel Gabriel Torres, Karla Perez
Luis Negron Lopez, Sabana Grande, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation was to verify if the variations in salinity parameters affect the reproduction of Artemia franciscana. The problem was: How might variations in salinity levels affect the reproduction of crustacean Artemia franciscana. The hypothesis under study was: when Artemia franciscana is exposed to different salinity levels, its reproduction is affected, therefore low salinity levels result in the reduction of the population of this crustacean. Forty specimens were collected and separated by gender into four groups. Specimens in group “A” were treated with 200 mL. of sea water, representing the control group. Crustaceans in group “B” were treated with 150 mL. of sea water and 50 mL. of distilled water. Specimens in group “C” were treated with 100 mL. of sea water and 100 mL. of distilled water and the ones in group “D” were treated with 50 mL. of sea water and 150 mL. of distilled water. Different amounts of distilled water were used to change water salinity and observe the changes in the reproduction of this crustacean. Reproduction capacity of each group was observed for seven days. Data analysis evidenced that low salinity levels caused the reduction of the population of this crustacean affecting its reproduction rate. It was demonstrated that the exposition of Artemia franciscana to different salinity levels, affects its reproduction and reduces its population. The projection for this research is to use Artemia franciscana as a biological indicator of environmental changes inducted by chemical substances that affect water salinity.

SPEED BOOST: THE EFFECT OF ENERGY DRINKS ON DROSOPHILA
Joseph G. Cotto, Elizabeth Maxwell
Liberal High School, Liberal, KS

The purpose of the project focuses on the effect of energy drinks and coffee on the reproductive capacity in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The hypothesis was that energy drinks would increase the reproductive capacity of Drosophila melanogaster, because of its high concentration of caffeine and high amounts of taurine. The substances tested were product A, product B, and product C. Product A had a high dose of taurine which causes high metabolism in both humans and fruit flies. The caffeine in product B and product C causes high blood pressure and body fatigue. Three vials were made for each substance for a total of 18 vials. The product A and product B vials had 20mL of liquid and 5.6g of medium. The Diluted vials of product A and product B had 10mL of water, 10 mL of energy drink, and 5.6g of medium. Product C vials had 10mL of water, 5.6 g of product C, and 5.6g of medium. Compared to the reproduction rates in the control group, product A was 15%, Diluted product A was 28%, and product B, Diluted product B, and product C were all 0%. Product A vials had mold on the top and only had reproduction in one vials. Diluted product A had no mold and reproduction was found in all of the vials. Product B vials and Diluted product B had mold on the bottom and no reproduction. The hypothesis was not supported because energy drinks have a negative impact on reproduction. This may be because of the higher amount of taurine in product B than in product A. The high levels of caffeine in product C may also be a factor since it was 85 times greater than that of product B and product A. Energy drinks may have potential as a non-toxic pesticide.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW COST SUSTAINABLE DIETS FOR THE CULTURE OF FRESHWATER PRAWNS
Kevin Charles Wise, Eric Gardiner
St. Joseph Catholic School, Greenville, MS

The purpose of this project was to evaluated different food sources for the culture of larval prawns raised in brackish saltwater system and adult prawns raised in a freshwater system. Adult prawns were fed a pelleted commercial catfish diet, a pelleted diet formulated with dried duckweed and zooplankton and natural pond vegetation without supplemental feed. Larval prawns were fed artemia, live freshwater zooplankton and two artificial artemia diets (EZ-Artemia and Artemac). Natural pond vegetation was shown to be a better source of nutrients than the pelleted diets. However, percent weight gain of prawns fed the pelleted diet formulated with zooplankton and duckweed was greater than prawns fed the re-pelleted catfish feed. None of the artemia replacements evaluated in this study were shown suitable for the culture of larvae prawns. This project indicates that prawns can be raised on natural pond vegetation without the use of supplemental feeds. Pelleted diets can be used to supplement pond vegetation but diets should be formulated to reflect natural food items. None of the diets evaluated as a replacement for artemia were shown to support growth of larval prawns and until a suitable replacement can be identified, live artemia must be used in the commercial.

ARE FINGERPRINTS INHERITED?
Rachel Erin Meagher, Jaime Nolan
Windsor High School, Windsor, VT

The purpose of this project was to examine what affects the creation of fingerprints. Originally, the project was designed to compare the fingerprints of family members to one another to determine if there was any correlation. A correlation between the prints would help to support the original hypothesis that fingerprints are inherited from one's parents. It was quickly found that there were too many variables in this experiment, therefore leaving the data inconclusive.<br><br>As the process of this project progressed, a new question was developed: Do fingerprints of the same person have any correlation between them? The experiment was then expanded to examine this question. A hypothesis that fingerprints of each individual are indeed similar between fingers. The data collected refuted this hypothesis. The more fingerprints analyzed, the more questions came to mind.<br><br>Research and the conclusions from the other parts of this project led to the idea that fingerprints are affected by the environment in which they are created. Fingerprint sets of twins, both fraternal and identical and their respective biological parents were collected and analyzed. The data collected supported the original hypothesis that one's fingerprints are inherited from his/her parents.<br><br>The creation of fingerprints continues to marvel scientists' brains. This project has shown insight to the complicated process of fingerprint analyzation and one of the many mysteries of the human body.

THE STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NOVEL OPTIMIZATION OF DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION TO OBTAIN ACCURATE FULL-FIELD DISPLACEMENT MEASUREMENTS
Alma Amad Alhussaini
Dhahran Schools, Khobar, SAUDI ARABIA

In the field of Mechanical Engineering, displacement of material can be used in identification of mechanical properties. When heterogeneous materials are subject to loads, they deform and their mechanical properties can be understood when local displacements are measured. In this research study, the main goal was to optimize a process called Digital Image Correlation which measures local displacements by comparing images of a specimen before and after loading. Recently, Digital Image Correlation has become a popular method because of the low cost of imaging devices. It is considered as a new method which, in comparison to standard methods such as the cross-head and strain gauge displacement method, can give full-field measurements. Optimization of DIC is essential in order to improve the accuracy of the data obtained when compared to the strain gauge method. In this study, the speckle pattern and subset sizes are parameters that were tuned in order to optimize the DIC process based on a specific testing apparatus. The three specimens tested: epoxy, aluminum, and steel were speckle patterned and displaced using the microstrain machine. Images taken via the CCD camera were later used for numerical comparison before and after displacement. When graphed, the larger subset size was closest to the ideal line obtained from Finite Element Method which suggests improved accuracy. It has been concluded that using a larger subset size and applying a speckle pattern from a greater distance leads to more accurate displacement estimation than the cross-head displacement and strain gauge methods. Findings show that using DIC methodology will assist in identification of material properties using inverse methods.
