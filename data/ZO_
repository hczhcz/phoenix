HOW DOES THE NUMBER OF “MOLE CRICKET NEMATODES” (S. SCAPTERISCI) APPLIED PER ACRE AFFECT THE CONTROL OF PEST MOLE CRICKETS ONE-YEAR POST APPLICATION? 3YR
Tyler Ashton Gary
DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida, UnitedStates of America

Florida cattlemen are seeking a cost-effective and permanent solution to the damage caused by non-indigenous mole crickets on bahiagrass in Florida. Approximately 75% of the 3.5 million acres of improved pastures that support the 1.2 million head cow-calf industry in Florida consist of bahiagrass pastures. Since 1996, about 400,000 acres of bahiagrass pasture have been destroyed by mole cricket infestation. In addition, mole crickets have caused an annual loss of $6 million in bahiagrass hay revenue.<br><br> <br><br> Twenty-four pit-fall traps were used in collecting the pest mole crickets for this experiment. The 24 linear pit-fall traps were strategically placed among 4 one-acre sites (6 traps to each acre). Different strip application rates of the “mole cricket nematode” (Steinernema scapterisci) were used as follows: 125 million nematodes/acre, 250 million nematodes/acre, 500 million nematodes/acre, and the control (0 nematodes/acre). The data from this study indicated that the nematode application rate with the greatest level of control one-year post application was the rate of 500 million nematodes/acre. It would appear that the higher the application rate of the mole cricket nematode (S. scapterisci) the greater the level of control one-year post application. For the 125 million nematodes/acre the percent of infected mole crickets ranged from 73.3% to 78.7% with a difference of 5.4%. For the 250 million nematodes/acre the percent of infected mole crickets ranged from 9.5% to 16.7% with a difference of 7.2%. For the 500 million nematodes/acre the percent of infected mole crickets ranged from 84.6% to 100% with a difference of 15.4%. <br><br>

EXAMINATION OF REPELLENT, INHIBITOR, AND ATTRACTANT PROPERTIES OF CATNIP OIL
Kay Dee Furman
Central High School, Brooksville, Fl, USA

The compound N,N-diethyl-3-benzamide (DEET) is one of the most effective active ingredients in commercial repellents used for personal protection from blood-sucking insects. Although this chemical is highly effective, care must be exercised in its use due to its plasticizing properties and potential hazard to infants. A safer and more effective alternative may be the essential oil of the catnip plant (nepetalactone) investigated in this study. The goal of this research is to determine whether nepetalactone is a mosquito repellent, inhibitor, or attractant, as well as the degree to which it is classified as such for the direct comparison to DEET. First, attraction and inhibition experiments were conducted in a triple cage, dual-port olfactometer. Both competitive and non-competitive bioassays were conducted on Aedes aegypti. Test variations, randomized for continuity, included studies with a human arm, catnip oil, DEET, lactic acid, acetone, and carbon dioxide. These chemicals were tested alone and in combination. The second experiment consisted of repellent studies that were performed using 200 caged female mosquitoes. In these tests, the prospective repellent was placed on a patch on the arm of a human volunteer. Both catnip oil and DEET were tested in repellent studies in ten dosages ranging from 0.002 uL to 1.0 uL. Repellent studies included testing on Ae. aegypti, An. quadrmaculatis, and An. albimanius. A statistical analysis was conducted to determine significance. Catnip oil was found to have classic inhibitor characteristics as indicated by the olfactometer competitive and noncompetitive testing. Catnip oil was found to be a better inhibitor than DEET. It was concluded that with further human toxicology testing, catnip oil would be a viable commercial alternative as well as a safer counterpart to DEET.

THE EFFECTS OF CAMP AND LIGHT ON THE BIOCHEMICAL ANATOMY OF PHOTORECEPTORS
Kristin Suzanne Alligood
Pedro Menendez High School, St. Augustine Florida, US

PURPOSE: To test the effects of cAMP and light on the distribution of proteins in Limulus photoreceptors. I hypothesis that exposure to light and cAMP will change the distribution of proteins in Limulus photoreceptors. METHODS: Two ventral roots of the Limulus polyphemus ventral eye, were incubated two nights in the dark in organ culture medium (OCM). The third night, 8bromo cAMP was added to one root. The next morning the roots were exposed to light or left in the dark in OCM. After different lengths of time, the roots were fixed in methanol/ formaldehyde, rehydrated then immunostained. The distribution of the proteins arrestin, opsin and myosin III were visualized with a confocal microscope. RESULTS: In the dark, opsin immunoreactivity (IR) was strong at the rhabdom and arrestin IR was weak. In the light, opsin IR was weaker at the rhabdom and arrestin IR was strong. Opsin IR vesicles were seen in the rhabdomeral lobe. When roots were exposed to 30 min of light then put back into the dark for 6 hours, arrestin IR was weak at the rhabdom. 8Bromo cAMP did not influence the light-dependent changes in opsin and arrestin IR, but it did increase myosin IR at the rhabdom in the dark. There was no light induced change in the distribution of myosin III. CONCLUSION: Light drives a reversible translocation of arrestin to the rhabdom in bright and dim light. 8Bromo cAMP increases the concentration of myosin III at the rhabdom. Opsin, at the rhabdom, becomes internalized as vesicles in light.

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED FILTRATION REQUIREMENTS ON PACIFIC BLUE MUSSEL BYSSAL THREAD PRODUCTION
Carl Harold Brodersen
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK, USA

Blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were placed in tanks and exposed to varying levels of water pollution in the form of glacial silt. Since mussels are plankton feeders that filter their food from the surrounding water, the addition of the silt created a hindrance in the food gathering process -namely; it took more time and energy to filter food from the polluted water than it would have from the unpolluted water.<br><br> This study aimed to determine if there is a correlation between the amount of effort required of a blue mussel to filter its food and its ability (or willingness) to put energy towards byssal thread production (-the threads used to anchor the mussel to substrate in the intertidal zone).<br><br> By placing mussels in increasingly polluted water and forcing them to regrow their threads every three days, and tallying each mussel’s<br><br>threads, it was determined that there is a significant decrease in thread production when water pollution is present.<br><br> Mussels placed in the most contaminated environment used in this study (a 2:3 silt/water ratio) produced an average 16% fewer threads than those in clean water, demonstrating that impurities in their water do affect mussels’ ability to produce threads.<br><br> It was also found that size plays a role in thread loss as well, with the largest mussels loosing an average 2% fewer threads than the smallest mussels, possibly demonstrating for the larger mussels an ability to filter water with more efficiency than smaller mussels.

DOES BLANKETING CALVES HELP IN THE RATE OF GAIN?
Holly Christine Bruns
GFW High School, North Cotton Wood Street, Wintrhrop, MN, 55396, USA

In my experiment I am trying to see if blanketing calves help in the rate of gain. <br><br>The purpose of this experiment is to see if it was beneficial for calves to wear blankets or not.<br><br>The procedure used was as follows; Step 1 - Find a willing farmer to let you weigh your calves for 4 weeks. Step 2 - Blanket theGroup A and Group B calves. Step 3 - Weigh the calves at 2 week intervals record the data. Step 4 - When Group A is done with 2 weeks, take the blankets off, but keep weighing them.<br><br>The results of this experiment were that Group C (control) gained the most weight in 4 weeks of experimenting.<br><br>The conclusion to this project was that the control calves had the highest rate of gain per day, which ended up being an average of 1.47 pounds. As the experimenting went on I could tell that the control calves had been the ones that were gaining more weight. The hypothesis for this exeriment was rejected because control calves gained .44 more pounds per day than the 4 week blanketed calves.

THE EFFECTS OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF PERMETHRIN ON S. TEREBRANS
Paul J Spadafora
Charlotte High School, Port Charlotte, FL, USA

This experiment examined the marine wood boring isopod, S. terebrans, and its reactions to the mosquitocide Permethrin. Permethrin is the standard aerial dispersed mosquitocide for Charlotte county, Florida, and is regularly and frequently dispersed throughout Charlotte county five months out of twelve. Using a base concentration of .00000000110 M (molar mass=391.27mol) the experiment studied 120 specimens of S. terebrans (40 per trial, ten per each tank), and their reactions to 100% of this concentration, 200% of this concentration, and 50% of this concentration (with tank 1 being a control) in three 4 hour trials. The experimenter hypothesized that the exposure to this chemical would induce minor behavioral changes, such as a lower motility, lower depth in the water column, and less aggressive/group tendencies. The results indicated that even in these low concentrations, permethrin is especially dangerous to S. terebrans. The 100% concentrations were always down to 20% of the original population within three hours, and the 200% concentration was always at that level no later than two hours. The minor behavioral effects predicted by exposure to the chemical were detectable only in the first half hour. The rapid die off was not predicted or expected.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENRICHED MICROSATELLITE LIBRARY FOR THE GENETIC ANALYSIS OF BRIAREUM ASBESTINUM
Nisha Vikram Shah, Lecanto High School
Lecanto, FL, USA

Currently scientists and researchers have been using the Caribbean coral Briareum asbestinum for various applications, including medical research. A microsatellite library, or a collection of nucleotide sequences consisting short genomic tandem repeats, would provide an efficient tool for pharmaceutical studies as well as sufficient information to study the speciesâ€™ genome. The object was to create the first microsatellite library for the B. asbestinum species to screen microsatellite loci for genetic analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue, digested, and size selected for fragments containing 400+ base pairs. After the fragments were linker ligated, a PCR reaction was conducted, and the PCR products were detected for (CA)n or (GT)n repeats. This was performed by inoculating a biotinylated (CA)n probe into the product. The selected fragments were then re-amplified and the PCR product was transferred into E.coli for growth, which resulted in 16 successful colonies. These colonies were diluted and again sought for (CA)n repeats, which resulted in 6 enriched colonies that were again cloned and re-screened . Of the 16 initial colonies, 2 contained microsatellites. Using Oligo laser waves, four enriched microsatellite sites were sequenced. The results of this project will be pursued for primer development to assay individuals of B. asbestinum to conclude individual encompassing of polymorphic qualities as well as other genetic relationships within and among coral reefs. On a health-based aspect, it will allow medical researchers to efficiently target the genes of a species responsible for the development of many pharmaceutical drugs to help mankind.

MEMORY RETENTION OF HABITUATED DUGESIA TIGRINA IN A SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT
Jennifer Rose Sass
Mid-Buchanan Faucett, Missouri United States

Dugesia tigrina can be used to demonstrate principles of comparative analysis of behavior and the bichemistry of learning.<br><br>A simulated microgravity environment is accomplished using a clinostat. The idea behind clinorotation is that if a specimen continually rotates without generating a centrifugal force, it cannot detect the direction of the fixed gravity vector. The problem addressed in this project is if simulated microgravity has an effect on the memory retention of Dugesia tigrina. The Dugesia tigrina were habituated for three days using the Boreal Science Kit Train-A-Tray apparatus. The Dugesia tigrina were tested for a right or left bias. After determining the organism's bias, the organism was trained to turn to its opposite bias with electrical stimulation using a 9-volt battery. The Dugesia tigrina were then cut transversely. One side of the Dugesia tigrina was placed on the clinostat, the other in the control group. The Dugesia tigrina were tested for memory retention once a week for three weeks. The project was repeated three times. On all trials the Dugesia tigrina affected by the simulated microgravity retained less memory than that of the control. This information aides in the understanding of the underlying physiology of behavior and the transmission of learned information in organisms in space flight.

CHEMORECEPTION IN MINUTE WASPS
Ashley Nicholle Tucker
Leland High School, Leland, MS, USA

This experiment was conducted to determine the electrophysiological response of Anaphes iole antennas to plant produced compounds induced by host feeding. The hypothesis was antenna responses are greater for compounds induced by host feeding than for constitutive compounds. (These are two different compounds produced during host feeding.)<br><br>After gathering the needed materials, the procedure was carried out. Ten plant produced compounds were collected and placed in labeled applicators. Then, an empty applicator and Paraffin oil were labeled as standard applicators. Sixteen Anaphes iole were collected. The antennas of these wasps were cut off and placed in the EAG machine. While placing the applicators in the EAG, the machine recorded the nerve responses the antennas gave off. The responses showed an increase or decrease that each antenna had on the compounds used in the experiment. All final responses were observed and recorded. The results showed that both male and female wasps have a greater response to host-induced compounds than to constitutive compounds. Because host-induced compounds are produced in response to bug feeding, wasps are more likely to smell these compounds while their host is present. In constitutive compounds, volatiles are produced before plant feeding. Thus, wasps might not find their host in time for hosts feeding or laying their eggs.

THE INFLUENCE OF "JUMPING GENES" ON THE GENOME INSTABILITY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Maria P Perepiolkina
Municipal High School #5, Novosibirsk, Russia

The purpose of this project is studying of: (1) influence of hobo mobile element or “jumping gene” on mutations frequency in the unstable genes yellow and Notch of Drosophila melanogaster before and after association of these genes in one chromosome and (2) frequency of occurrence of recessive lethal mutations (RLM) in a chromosome where these genes are located before and after gamma-irradiation.<br><br>Crosses of Drosophila melanogaster flies containing unstable genes arisen from natural populations were used for receiving a recombinant line. For RLM analysis test Meller-5 was used.<br><br>Instability in the gene yellow does not depend on instability in the gene Notch. In the analysis of recessive lethal mutations (RLM), an increased instability in all along the X-chromosome containing unstable hobo is revealed. Frequency of occurrence of RLM in this line is higher than in a line that does not contain and not connected with yellow gene. Instability of genome through 10 cGr has not changed (even some reduction of frequency RLM is observed). Instability in genome, containing an unstable hobo-mobile element is comparable to action of irradiation in a dose of 300 cGr.<br><br>

RELIABILITY OF BURNED OTOLITHS TO AGE ARCHOSARGUS PROBATOCEPHALUS
Christopher Jason Atkins
Brunswick High School, Brunwsick, Ga, 31525, United States of America

Sectioned otoliths are generally used to reliably age Archosargus probatocephalus (sheepshead). Whole otoliths are not used as they vary in thickness and size and have a rough surface. These features make it difficult to read the age rings used to determine the age of the fish. Since the assessment of fish populations is essential, accurate methods of aging are a critical tool. If whole otoliths could be used to age Archosargus probatocephalus, valuable time could be saved and more frequent monitoring of the species could occur. A total of 80 samples were examined representing fish otoliths spanning from 1-18 years. These samples had previously been aged as whole otoliths and compared to known values provided by DNR marine biologists. During the previous comparison, it was determined unaltered whole otoliths could not be used to reliably age Archosargus probatocephalus. During Phase II these same otoliths were burned and further enhanced using cedar oil. The ages were then determined. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed the differences for all values to be statistically significant. Pairwise comparisons (TTEST) were conducted to determine if whole otoliths could be read as reliably as sectioned otoliths. For otoliths aged 13 and less, the difference in values was statistically significant at the .047 level and thus could not be used as a reliable method of determining age. For otoliths aged 12 or less, the difference in values was not statistically significant at .096 and thus could be considered a reliable method of aging Archosargus probatocephalus. Whole otoliths enhanced by burning and cedar oil can be used to accurately age Archosargus probatocephalus, aged 12 or less.

THERMAL PREFERENCE FOR THE NATIVE, TRACHYMYRMEX SEPTENTRIONALIS, AND THE INTRODUCED, CYPHOMYRMEX RIMOSUS, FUNGUS-GARDENING ANTS.
Abu-Bakr Zafar
Panama City Advanced School, FL, United States

Thermal preference of the two fungus – gardening ants, Trachymyrmex septentrionalis and Cyphomyrmex rimosus were investigated in a laboratory using a temperature gradient ranging from 12 C to 35 C.<br><br> Workers, along with a piece of their fungus, were placed in six Petri dishes that were connected via plastic tubing equidistantly across the gradient so that the chambers were approximately 16 cm apart. They were allowed four hours to find a suitable place for the colony, including the fungus. Temperature was recorded every thirty minutes to assure the linear temperature gradient stayed constant. This experiment was conducted over five weeks and repeated seven times to have promising data.<br><br> Both species were observed to move quickly away from the hot end; thus illustrating that extremely high temperatures are lethal to the colony. Furthermore, Trachymyrmex septentrionalis had a very distinct preference ranging from 23.1 C to 26.0 C, while the preferences of Cyphomyrmex rimosus were very ambiguous; hence, demonstrating that they have a wide range of suitable living conditions for the colony as well as the fungus.<br><br>

A MINERAL STUDY OF SELECTED PASTURE SITES AND BOVINE ON THE LOWER GILLESPIE
Lacy Ann Gillespie
North Toole County High School, Sunburst Montana, United States

This study examined the mineral levels in plant and water samples from the Lower Gillespie Ranch and the mineral levels in cattle grazing on this land. The pasture was divided into ten areas, and from each area a representative vegetation sample was collected. Blood samples and liver biopsy samples were collected and analyzed along with the plant samples by using an Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometer. Water samples were collected from all watering sites in the pasture and analyzed for total sulfate content. Hay to be fed to the cows over the testing period was analyzed for mineral content. <br><br> The results of this study indicated a primary and secondary copper deficiency in both the vegetation and the cattle grazing on it. A supplementation program consisting of the administration of copper boluses was started along with a free choice supplement of 2,500 ppm copper. The copper mineral levels increased significantly in the group receiving boluses and the group receiving only mineral did not significantly increase. Zinc, molybdenum, and lead levels in the cattle significantly increased over the testing period and may be a source of antagonism in the utilization of the minerals by the cattle. Selenium levels in both the forages and animals were within acceptable ranges.<br><br>

NOGO RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN ZEBRAFISH NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
Lani Ong Martinez, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute
Baltimore, Maryland U.S.A.

Regeneration of nerve fibers is limited and injury to the central nervous system remains permanent. A number of proteins present in myelin have been implicated in failure of regeneration: oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMGP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo, NogoR, and p75. It is not known what role these proteins normally play in neural development. My project was to characterize zebrafish orthologues of omgp, mag, nogo-r, and p75 mRNAs that are expressed during early development. Using anti-sense morpholinos that block NogoR protein synthesis, I found that the Nogo signaling pathway in myelin may play a role in peripheral nerve development.

MOLECULAR EVALUATION OF TUH-1 GENE IN DROSOPHILA
Maria Luisa Pineda
American Senior High School, Miami, Fl, Dade

The purpose of this study is to analyze the tumorous-head-1 (tuh-1) gene in Drosophila on a molecular basis. Tuh-1 is a maternal effect gene and has two different alleles called tuh-1h and tuh-1g. The gene interacts with the tumorous-head-3 (tuh-3) mutant and together they cause head defects (tuh-1h) or genital defects (tuh-1g). It is hypothesized that the tuh-1 gene, located in region 20A1 on the X chromosome is present in at least one P1 clone mapped to this region of the Drosophila genome. Five P1 clones were obtained from the Drosophila genome project, grown up, subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, Southern Blot analysis and in situ hybridization to a small 1.2 kb DNA fragment (G5B7) obtained prior to this investigation. Sequence analysis of G5B7 showed homology to hypothetical gene CG12565 and cDNA clone RE23430 in Drosophila. Based on these results it is further hypothesized that tuh-1 represents gene CG12565 and cDNA RE23430 represents the mRNA for tuh-1. To test this hypothesis total RNA was isolated from four different Drosophila strains, primers were designed and RT-PCR was carried out to determine whether tuh-1 represents CG12565. The results show that two of the P1 clones tested indeed show homology to G5B7 verifying the presence of at least part of the tuh-1 gene in these clones. RT-PCR results strongly suggest that RE23430 represents the mRNA for tuh-1. Identifying the tuh-1 gene on a molecular level will be important in further understanding how genes interact with each other and how these interactions effect development.<br><br>

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING COLD SENSATION IN EMBRYONIC RAT DRGS
Deborah Lynn Steffen
Glenwood High School, Chatham, IL, USA

The purpose of this study is to determine the existence of a cold receptor in embryonic rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGs) and to compare the properties of the cold receptor to those of the heat/capsaicin receptor in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cold sensation.<br><br> Giga-seal patch clamp techniques were used to record single channel currents after application of menthol. The channel, at positive and negative voltages, was recorded, digitized, and analyzed for channel amplitude and open probability (Popen). The channel Popen was higher at positive potentials compared to negative potentials (5.48pA to 3.252pA), contributing to outward rectification. The Popen was extremely high at both potentials, approximately 0.97. Confocal microscopy experiments analyzed the calcium permeability of the channel. After the DRGs were incubated in Fluo4, which fluoresces with the binding of calcium, calcium intake was observed and recorded as an increase in fluorescence. Since menthol-sensitive neurons were not as permeable to calcium as capsaicin-sensitive neurons, as demonstrated by less flourescence, either capsaicin is more potent than menthol, menthol-sensitive neurons are less calcium permeable, and/or organelles in menthol-sensitive neurons are more efficient at calcium intake.<br><br> In response to application of menthol, single channel activity was observed, suggesting the presence of a cold/menthol channel. Single channel current amplitude was dependent on voltage, but Popen was very high at both voltages. Through the fluorescence of Fluo4, it was determined that the menthol channel is also calcium permeable, but less than the capsaicin channel.

IVERMECTIN, PYRANTEL PAMOATE, OR FENBENDAZOLE? A COMPARISON OF EQUINE ANTHELMINTICS
Leann Little, Clarkrange High School
Clarkrange, TN, USA

The researcher conducted this experiment to ascertain which of three equine anthelmintics; Zimectrin (ivermectin), Strongid (pyrantel pamoate), or Safe-Guard (fenbendazole), was most effective in the reduction of large and small strongyle eggs.<br><br>To perform this investigation, the researcher collected fecal samples from sixteen different equines; eight of which were in stalls and eight of which were on pasture. She then performed a complete laboratory pre-treatment fecal analysis to calculate the number of eggs per gram of feces. Next, the researcher administered anthelmintics to horses requiring treatment and a placebo to those in the control group. After a fifteen day waiting period, a post-treatment fecal analysis was performed. To find the percentage of efficacy, the post-treatment average from each group was subtracted from the pre-treatment average. The difference of these two numbers was divided by the pre-treatment average. This number was multiplied by ten to equal the percentage of efficacy.<br><br> After all her calculations were complete, the researcher found that the anthelmintics had the following percentages of efficacy: ivermectin 100%; fenbendazole 94%; pyrantel pamoate 96%. The placebo that was administered to the horses in the control group had an efficacy of -34%.<br><br> In conclusion, the researcher found that the anthelmintic with the highest percentage of efficacy was the one with the active ingredient ivermectin (Zimectrin). The dewormer with the lowest percentage of efficacy contained the active ingredient fenbendazole (Safe-Guard). When the horses in the control group were administered a placebo, which contained nothing as an active ingredient, the number of eggs per gram increased.<br><br>

BUCKING A TREND -THE OWLS'FIGHT TO SURVIVE
Miyuki Mashiko
Mito First Senior High School, Mito, Ibaraki (Japan)

Ever since man first appeared, mankind and nature have competed for the earth’s resources. Animals are unable to negotiate with humans, so it is up to humans to strike a balance. This study examined a local park ecology in an effort to determine what could be done to achieve this goal. The consumers at the highest level of the park’s food chain (hawks and owls, but specifically owls) were observed as a target study. In Japan, the owl population has been declining. The local owl population was representative of the national trend. It was observed that hawks had sufficient resources for breeding (food and nesting supplies) while owls had insufficient resources. In an effort to restore the owl population and since owls are nocturnal and thereby difficult to monitor in the daytime, birds with similar nesting and eating habits as owls were observed. An overall picture of the park’s environment and ecological system, including data regarding its food chain, was developed. Additionally, an artificial nest was provided for the owls due to a lack of bigger trees that were suitable for owls’nests. Owls were observed to be using this nest. It has been determined that Edue to a variety of evidence Ethe population of the owls at this park has stabilized despite the national trend. As a result of this study, it is believed that other parks could benefit from people observing the food chain and selectively providing additional nests where needed.

THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF DAPHNIA, JUST A HEARTBEAT AWAY
Shelly Selina Davis
Turtle Mt Community High School Belcourt, ND USA

There are many illegal drugs used by people in the world. These illegal drugs receive a lot of media coverage and many groups focus their attention on making people aware of these drugs to help cut down on the illegal use of these drugs. But what about all the legal drugs that people use. If you are an adult, you can legally purchase alcohol and nicotine. Anyone can purchase substances that contain caffeine and aspirin. These 4 substances are also drugs. In my project, I wanted to see the effects of legal drugs on the heart rate.<br><br> I used a microscopic organism, the Daphnia, to help me with my project. The Daphnia is very transparent and the hear can be easily observed using a microscope. I set up a chamber for the Daphnia and recorded the normal heartbeat, than I added dilute solutions of caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and aspirin to the chambers, than recorded the heart rates again. I actually made movies of the Daphnia using a microscope camera so that I could get a more accurate reading of the heart rates.<br><br> My results showed an increase in heart rate when I added caffeine and nicotine, a decrease in heart rate when I added alcohol, and no change when I added aspirin. These are results that I expected, but my results showed that when I added nicotine to the Daphnia, their heart rate dramatically increased and within a minute the Daphnia died. None of the other drugs had such a dramatic effect on the heart rate.

THE EFFECT SEA STAR COELOMOCYTES HAVE ON ASTEROIDEA REGENERATION IN VIVO AND LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS BRAIN CELLULAR PROLIFERATION IN VITRO
Gregory Amend
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, USA

The ability of sea star coelomocytes to regulate sea star regeneration in vivo and the proliferation of earthworm brain cells in vitro was studied. The purpose was to determine if sea star coelomocytes could regulate cell differentiation in two different invertebrate systems. Coelomocytes from two species of sea stars, Echinoster spinulosus and Protoreaster nodosus were used in this experiment. This project was divided into two phases of research. In Phase One, Ray V of all sea stars were amputated and coelomocytes were injected into the coelomic cavity just posterior to the amputated ray of all experimental sea stars. Injections of coelomocytes were timed according to the drop in coelomocyte cellularity, so that higher than normal levels of coelomocytes were maintained. Phase Two involved culturing Lumbricus terrestris brain cells in vitro with coelomocytes that were either put directly into culture plates or implanted into diffusion chambers. Earthworm brain cells and sea star coelomocyte controls were cultured separately. It was observed that coelomocytes accelerated the rate of sea star regeneration. On average, treated sea star rays from both species were found to be 45% longer than non-treated sea stars. Numbers of earthworm brain cells cultured with coelomocytes increased approximately three fold and formed groups of cells that appeared to be differentiating. Differentiating cells were not observed in control plates. The results of this experiment suggest that sea star coelomocytes are able to regulate cells to proliferate and differentiate in sea star regeneration and in vitro cultures of earthworm brain cells.<br><br>

THE INTERACTIONS OF SUGAR SUBSTITUES WITH WARFARIN SODIUM AND FLUOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE
Kaleb Markus Naegeli
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, United States of America

The purpose was to evaluate the interactions of sugar substitutes (aspartame, sucralose, and stevia) with prescription medicines (Warfarin Sodium (Coumadin) and Fluoxetine Hydrochloride (Prozac)). Groups of ten Daphnia magna were introduced into concentrations of 946 milliliters of water with one of the following: 0.9 grams of sucralose, aspartame, and stevia both with and without maltodextrin; 0.5 milligrams active ingredient of Warfarin Sodium or 10 milligrams active ingredient Fluoxetine Hydrochloride; or a combination of each medicine with each sweetener. Another Daphnia group without any substitute or medicine was a control. Once in the solution, Daphnia’s heart rate, appendage movements, eye twitches, and somersaults were measured at intervals of five minutes, one hour, and twenty-four hours. Fluoxetine Hydrochloride first increased in activity that declined at the one and twenty-four hour tests. Each medicine was used as a control for its respective combination groups. After twenty-four hours, stevia/maltodextrin/Warfarin Sodium caused a significant difference in appendage movements (t-test=2.66 > t.05=2.306). After twenty-four hours Fluoxetine Hydrochloride/sucralose caused a significant difference in average heart rate at the twenty-four hour test (t-test= 4.37 > t.01=3.707); pure stevia/Fluoxetine Hydrochloride caused a significant difference in the heart rate (t-test=4.82> t.01=3.355); aspartame/Fluoxetine Hydrochloride rejected the null hypothesis at the 98.1% level for appendage movements (t-test=3.04 > t.05=2.447), and the 99% level for somersaults (t-test=3.53 > t.01=3.499). Somersaults comparison of stevia/Fluoxetine Hydrochloride and stevia/maltodextrin/Fluoxetine Hydrochloride groups was significant (t-test=3.19 > t.05=2.306). The hypothesis was partially supported by the data. In conclusion, some sugar substitutes interact negatively with Warfarin Sodium and Fluoxetine Hydrochloride.

DIFFERENTIATION OF THE THREE LARGE WHITE STRAINS OF MELEAGRIS GALLAPAVO IN THE MIDWEST BY ANALYSIS OF REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS, A THREE-YEAR STUDY.
Thomas Joseph Schaffer
North Daviess Jr/Sr High School Elnora, IN

Integrated commercial turkey operations depend on primary breeder companies for their superior genetic potential in reaching their production goals. The purpose of this project was to determine which breed of domestic large white turkey, in the Midwest, is the better bird in terms of reproductive capacity determined by poults per hen produced. This was accomplished by evaluating overall egg production, fertility, hatchability, hen mortality, and cull eggs. The study included three breeds: British United Turkeys of America, Hybrid, and Nicholas. The study was based on extensive egg production records exceeding twenty million eggs.<br><br>The results showed that B.U.T.A. strongly outperformed the other two breeds on all aspects of the project. The eggs per hen and poults per hen were significantly higher in B.U.T.A. than Nicholas (P<0.01). There was no difference in fertility between B.U.T.A. than Nicholas (P<0.9). Hatchability showed a slight advantage for B.U.T.A. but the P value was only (P<0.08). Mortality and cull eggs were higher in Nicholas than B.U.T.A. and both were significantly higher (P<0.0001). B.U.T.A. outperformed the other breeds on poults per hen by a combined difference of 6.8 poults. The birds were evaluated in old and new facilities, thus removing that as a variable. B.U.T.A. was shown to be the significant breed with an average of seven poults per hen more than the other two breeds.<br><br>

HABITAT PREFERENCES OF LAGODON RHOMBOIDES: A FIELD STUDY
Stephanie Anne Hanisak
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, Florida, USA

Florida’s Indian River Lagoon is home to a diversity of habitats, including six types of seagrasses, bare sand, oyster beds, mangrove roots, and drift algae. This project was conducted in the field to study the effects of natural habitats on the growth of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). Experimental cages (1 meter x 1 meter x 0.6 meter) were made of rebar, PVC pipe, tie wraps, and plastic garden fencing. Three cages were deployed at four sites (sand, shoal grass, turtle grass, and mixed turtle grass and shoal grass) in the Lagoon. Pinfish were weighed and their lengths measured weekly for 2 months to determine growth rates in the habitats.<br><br> As hypothesized, pinfish grew the most in turtle grass, followed by mixed grass, shoal grass, and sand. During the first week of this experiment, algae that create a condition known as red tide were sampled close to the deployed cages, which allowed this project to study the effects of red tide on growth. There was no growth during the time of exposure to red tide. There was a significant relationship found between weekly growth and salinity, temperature, and turbidity. Pinfish grew more at lower salinities and lower temperatures.<br><br> This project determined the importance of seagrasses as a significant habitat in Indian River Lagoon. The results also suggested that red tide has a stronger influence on the ecology of this ecosystem than people previously believed. The red tide appears to be more crippling to pinfish growth than cold temperatures.

AN ANALYSIS OF RIVER DYNAMICS AND THEIR EFFECTS UPON LARVAL TRICHOPTERA POPULATIONS
Hillary Anne Fultz
Bagley High School, 1130 Main Ave N, Bagley MN 56621

This study hypothesizes that the number distributions of larval caddisflies would be dependent upon areas in the Clearwater River as well as variations in speed, depth, sun exposure, and algae presence within those regions. Before the amassing of specimens, the river characteristics were calculated (i.e. speed was found by use of a flotation device). Throughout the collection process of larval Trichoptera, every caddisfly was removed from 30 rocks in each area. A total of 270 rocks were sampled to represent the nine examined regions. Upon preserving the specimens, the researcher then applied McCafferty’s Aquatic Entomology dichotomous key for macroinvertebrate identification. At the completion of both field and lab studies, 471 larval caddisflies were identified to the subfamily level. Six main types were found to be prominent in the nine individually tested areas of the Clearwater River: 106 Hydropsychinae, 253 Diplectroninae, 10 Arctopsychinae, 6 Macronematinae, 11 Hydroptilidae, 83 Helicopsychidae. These types were further researched to determine their ecological niche as well as their importance to the ecosystem. Caddisfly distributions demonstrated specific relationships among the hypothesized variables and were applied to statistical analyses to prove such: Chi-square Test, Pearson-Product Correlation, and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). These statistical analyses organized the data in such a manner that the numerical values could plainly display their correlations. For example, there was a distinct relationship between the subfamily Hydropsychinae and the variable Speed. Similar correlations with other studied factors were also proven statically significant.<br><br>

GROMPHADORHINA PORTENTOSA--DRUG BUGS?
Tristan Vaughn Williams
Mayfield High School, Las Cruces, New Mexico

The purpose of “Gromphadorhina portentosa--Drug Bugs?” was to determine the effect of conditioning training using a scent on Gromphadorhina portentosa (Madagascar hissing cockroaches) hissing response. These roaches generally hiss when threatened. It was hypothesized that conditioning training could be used on Gromphadorhina portentosa to cause hissing in response to a scented stimulus. Because these cockroaches hiss audibly and have an excellent sense of smell, this experiment was an attempt to find a possible alternative to detector dogs. <br><br> A mixed gender population of mature Gromphadorhina portentosa specimens was obtained. Ten individuals were randomly selected, identified, and isolated. A control was initially conducted by holding a permanent marker 3 cm in front of each roach for 2 seconds. In Experiment 2, eighty-five two part tests (A&B) were conducted over five days. In Part A, a permanent marker was held in front of each roach. In Part B, a permanent marker was held in front of each roach and the roach was prodded with a finger. Hissing responses were recorded. Twenty additional tests (Experiment 3) were performed to determine hissing responses to the marker only. <br><br> The control tests showed no response in any individual. Experiment 2, the actual conditioning, showed increases in hissing responses as the experiment progressed. In Experiment 3, four individuals showed hissing responses which were supported by statistical P values (<.001) when compared to the control. The hypothesis was supported.<br><br> This experiment raises the possibility of the potential usefulness of Gromphadorhina portentosa.<br><br>

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BARRED OWL (STRIX VARIA) CALLS AND RESPONSES IN NON-BREEDING SEASONS
Alexander W. Seebeck
Loudoun Valley High School, Purcellville, Virginia, USA

The Barred Owl (Strix varia) is a bird of medium height with a wingspan of about three feet. Owl behavior includes defending territories with calls. The goal of this continuing project was to find a conspecific call that will elicit responses during non-breeding seasons. This research started in the Fall of 2001 with a survey of four Barred Owls, and expanded into a Summer 2002 study of 26 new adult owls and nine young. This survey received almost 200 responses just to one call and was so successful that in 26 tries, 25 times owls responded. New discoveries this year include the fact that juvenile Barred Owls can be located, counted and studied using playback. At sites where there were young owls, the young did not distinguish between recorded calls and those from adults. When the young arrived quickly, this meant that the recording must have been close to, or in the nesting territory. How far away the owl is when the survey is begun can be estimated from the owls' approach time. The "Guidelines for Nocturnal Owl Monitoring in North America" (Takats, et. al. 2001) recommend that no audio playback be used for census purposes; only a silent listening period is needed. However, Zuberogoitia (2000) indicated that non-playback methods are faulty for Tawny owls. Because a reliable survey (96 percent success rate) has been developed during this project for locating Barred Owls, future studies will be able to test the effectiveness of the non-playback method.

EFFECTS OF FOLLISTATIN IN MYOSTATIN ACTIVITY AND MUSCLE GROWTH
Dung Nghia Tran, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute
Baltimore, Maryland, Unites States

The purpose of this research is to find more about the function of follistatin and how it can limit myostatin, a signal protein that acts as a muscle growth inhibitor. Myostatin causes muscle decay because it is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle. One goal is to reproduce follistatin in the lab so it may be used to cure muscular diseases in humans. Understanding of this protein can increase knowledge of muscle development for both humans and farm animals. Such knowledge will increase our food supply to help sustain the fast growing population and thus save our environment from destruction. The general method of this research is to screen for the transgenic fish that over-produce the follistatin protein present in its muscle. Our next step is to let the follistatin fish reproduce. The F2 generation will be used to study the muscle development and how follistatin influences it by limiting myostatin.

A WAKE UP CALL THE EFFECT OF CELL PHONE EMISSIONS ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Blake Allen Campbell
Stevens High School, Rapid City, South Dakota, USA

Drosophila melanogaster was used to examine the effect of cell phone emissions on living cells. Cultures containing fifteen males and fifteen females per vial were placed at different distances (0, 2.5 and 50 centimeters) from the antenna of an activated cell phone for one hour daily for seven days. The following variables were studied: cumulative exposure time, distance from the antenna, silent versus voice transmission, and gender susceptibility.<br><br>Mortality rates increased as a function of exposure time. Mortality rates were also statistically significant not only at 0 cm distance from the antenna (P = 0.000), but also at 2.5 cm (P = 0.042). This suggests that with current designs, the Federal Communications Commission's requirement that a cell phone's antenna be at least one inch from a person's skull may not be a sufficiently safe distance. <br><br>Mortality rates were higher with voice transmission (30.0% at 0 cm and 15.0% at 2.5 cm) as opposed to silent transmission (18.2% at 0 cm and 7.3% at 2.5 cm). Magnetic, electric and radio/microwave fields were difficult to quantify, but increased with voice transmission and with increasing proximity to the antenna. <br><br>There was a curious difference in the mortality rates of males versus females. Males were significantly more vulnerable to cell phone emissions. The P value comparing the two genders at 50 cm, a distance established as non-exposed, was not significant (P = 0.083). However, the P values were statistically significant at 0 and 2.5 cm, P = 0.000 and P = 0.010, respectively. <br><br>

A FECAL ANALYSIS OF EQUUS CABALLUS PHASE II
Stephanie Ann Arneson
Rosholt High School, Rosholt, SD, USA

Purpose: To see how different commercial dewormers affected the eggs per gram count in horses. To develop a natural killing agent from herbs, that could be applied to the environment.<br><br>Hypothesis: Quest will be the best dewormer because it's said to last longer and kills encysted small strongyles. Dandelion root or rosemary leaf will affect nematodes and larvae because rosemary leaf is being used in turkey feed for parasites and dandelion root kills bacteria.<br><br>Procedure: 1) Fecal Analysis: Collected fecal samples from six horses every day for twelve weeks, both before and after worming. I used the McMasters chamber method to find the EPG of all fecal samples. A study of a newborn foal was also conducted to determine the development pattern of parasites within a horse.<br><br>2) Development of a Natural Parasiticide: A solution of 7 natural products was created by combining 10 grams plant material with 100 mL of distilled water. These natural solutions were tested on vinegar eels and fly larvae. Vinegar eels were tested by placing a counted number of eels in contact with a drop of a natural product. Fly larvae were tested by placing them in contact with cotton saturated with a natural product. Killing times were recorded for each study. <br><br>Conclusion: All 3 dewormers lowered the EPG to zero, but moxidectin provided longer lasting results. Dandelion root was effective in killing nematodes and larvae and has the potential to be used as a natural parasite killing agent. <br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF FEEDING AND NESTING BEHAVIOR AS INDICATORS OF RELATIVE METABOLIC RATE IN PHIDIPPUS SP.
Erin Louise Moulding, Fremont High School
Plain City, Utah USA

The established procedure for determining standard metabolic rate (SMR) is complex and laboratory dependent. This study investigated nesting and feeding behaviors of jumping spiders at two temperatures to determine if these could be used in the field as indicators of relative metabolic rate. Phidippus sp. were collected in northern Utah during October 2002, and kept at two temperatures: 10 C and 20 C. Because spiders are poikilotherms cold temperature lowers metabolic rate, allowing for comparison of behaviors reflecting metabolic rate. Variables observed as indicators of metabolic rate were (a) presence of a nest, (b) relative size of the nest, (c) thickness of the nest, (d) lapse-time between introduction of prey and consumption (consumption time), and (e) number of waste excretions. Using rubrics to assess variables, data were collected cumulatively during a cycle. Feeding, observation, and data collection cycles lasted for 7-10 days. At the beginning of each new cycle, all containers were thoroughly cleaned to remove nest silk and waste. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients (alpha= 0.05). Statistically significant correlations were found for group assignment to consumption time (r=0.941) and group assignment to average waste excretions (r=0.861), suggesting these variables were indicators of metabolic rate. Nesting variables were significantly correlated to one another, but not significantly correlated to group assignment, indicating that nesting does not reflect metabolic rate. Further research using established laboratory methods for SMR are needed to define a scaled relationship between consumption time and waste excretion and SMR for use in fieldwork.

"ANT"ARCHY
Sarah Elizabeth Skrivanek, St. Joseph Catholic School
Bryan, Texas, United States

There are two types of red imported fire ants, monogyne (single queen) colony and polygyne (multiple queen) colony forms. Workers from polygyne colonies are smaller, lighter in color, and less aggressive than workers from monogyne colonies. Workers in a monogyne colony are more territorial than those of a polygyne colony. The hypothesis for this project was, the monogyne colony will have significantly better foraging success than the polygyne colony. To test the hypothesis the ants from the monogyne colony were painted silver and the ants from the polygyne colony were painted yellow. The ants were then tested in three seperate trials to see which colony would have better foraging success. In each trial both colonies shared a common food source for twenty-four hours. The food source and any ants in the feeding area were removed. Using a microscope, the ants from the feeding area were counted to determine the number of silver (monogyne) and yellow (polygyne) ants that were present. At the end of each trial it was observed that there were more silver ants than yellow ants present in the feeding area. The results of this experiment proved the hypothesis was correct.

EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACT OF SPIRULINA AND THE APIS MELLIFERA LINNAEUS LIKE LIKE A TISSUE REGENARATOR IN ACANTHASTHER PLANICI
Nathalie Santiago
Florencia Garcia Hight School, Apartdado 1221,Las Piedras , Puerto Rico, 00771

The purpose of this investigation was to find a new effective and natural tissue regenerator accessible to all people. To this intend a tissue regenerator, based on a preparation of the marine alga Spirulina and honey, was developed and tested in the starfish (Acanthasther planci). The habitat of the starfish was recreated in four aquariums, one for control group; the other three for experimental group. Six starfish were put in each aquarium.<br><br>On all starfish a 4 cm long incision was made along the length of the upper surface of one arm. At the tip of another arm 1.3 cm was excised.<br><br>A 1.5 cc of Spirulina extract was applied at the cuts of the starfish in experimental aquarium 1; a 1.5cc of honey was applied to the starfish in aquarium 2. and a 1.5cc of the mixture of Spirulina and honey was applied to those in aquarium 3.<br><br> It was observed that the incisions in the experimental group with the mixture of Spirulina and honey healed in five days while the control group healed in eight days. The excised arms were regenerated in 24 days with Spirulina extract alone, while it took 35 days in the control group.<br><br>It is possible to conclude that both solutions accelerate the regeneration process in starfish; and that these simple materials are effective regenerators of tissues. The effectivity of such substances in the clonation process of human skin can be studied.<br><br>

APHID POPULATIONS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO PLANT HEIGHT, PARASITES, AND PREDATORS
Genevieve Geraldine Mount
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine how the number of aphids on a plant affects the plant height, parasites and predators. I tested to see if aphid population increase would inversely affect the plant height. I also tested to see if aphid populations would positively affect the number of parasites and predators.<br><br>The plants used were pac choi, lettuce, chard, cabbage and broccoli. There were six plants of each type; they were randomly planted in two different boxes. One box was the control, when necessary I sprayed it with a simple soap spray to keep the aphids off. Twice every week I counted the number of leaves, measured plant height and counted the number of aphids, parasitized aphids and predators on each plant. Lepidopterous pests were removed by hand.<br><br>Aphid populations affected the height of the plants; any population of aphids hindered the growth of the plants. I discovered an aphid population threshold level that attracted syrphid flies to lay their eggs in a colony of aphids. I found that there were no obvious threshold levels between the numbers of parasitized aphids and the aphid populations. The parasite and predator populations both peaked at the same time, right after the aphid populations peaked. This indicates both parasites and predators benefited from the peak in aphid population, and they both caused the aphid populations to plunge downward.<br><br> <br><br>

THE LATE SEASON FLIGHT PHENOLOGY AND RESPONSES OF IPS PINI TO ENANTIOMERIC BLENDS OF THE AGGREGATION PHEROMONE IPSDIENOL
Heather Anne Charton
Tuscarawas Valley High School, Bolivar, Ohio, USA

This project further explored the realms of the life cycle of the pine and spruce predator, Ips pini. It specifically focused on preferred enantiomeric blends of the aggregation pheromone ipsdienol and the late season flight phenology of Ips pini. Such information is required in order for the prevention of the destruction Ips pini is causing to the pine and spruce forests of America.<br><br> A total of twelve lindgren-funnel traps were placed in two pine forests, one red pine stand and one white pine stand. Five of the six traps in each forest were baited with lures of ipsdienol [97%(+):3%(-); 75%(+):25%(-); 50%(+):50%(-); 25%(+):75%(-); 3%(+):97%(-).] The sixth trap was left as a control. On a weekly basis, traps were emptied, and lures were re-randomized. The contents of each trap were counted, recorded, and entered into a data table.<br><br> The data from this experiment was entered into a statistical analysis program. Using the p-values, it was apparent that Ips pini showed a considerable preference for the 75%(+):25%(-), 50%(+):50%(-),and 25%(+):75%(-) blends of ipsdienol. The data also displayed a peak in flight activity on approximately the tenth of October and a second peak on the fifteenth of September.<br><br> This project contributed two important conclusions. First, Ips pini was shown to prefer the 75%(+):25%(-), 50%(+):50%(-), and 25%(+):75%(-) blends of ipsdienol. Secondly, the flight activity of Ips pini has been shown to peak every four to six weeks.

THE SHELL-SWITCHING BEHAVIORS OF THE HERMIT CRAB PAGURUS LONGICARPUS
Carling Marie Sitterley
Jefferson Forest High/Central Virginia Governor's School, Forest, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine what the shell preferences are of the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus; if the relative weight difference between two P. longicarpus affects the outcomes of interactions; and whether or not dead snail tissue is an effective cue to the P. longicarpus in detecting shells. This study was conducted in the fall and winter months of 2002 to 2003 at a local high school. Three tests were conducted, each studying different behaviors of the P. longicarpus. The hermit crabs were given free reign to an assortment of shells for at least 48 hours, and afterward measurements were taken of different crab and shell parameters, including weight. To study the interactions, two hermit crabs were placed in a small container, and parameter measurements were taken of both crabs involved and their shells after the test. To test the effectiveness of snail tissue as a shell cue, a hermit crab was placed an equal distance from a control shell and an experimental shell treated with snail tissue. The results showed that the shell adequacy index is the best way to determine shell fit and that the hermit crab P. longicarpus preferred a shell adequacy index of 1.1. A t-test (alpha-value at 0.05; p-value equal to 0.15) was conducted in the test of snail tissue detection between the amount of time that the P. longicarpus spent examining the control shell and the amount of time that it spent examining the experimental shell. There was no significant difference.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND HABITAT ON THE ROAD MORTALITY OF SNAKES IN THE KILLDEER PLAINS WILDLIFE AREA
Nathan Jacobs Yaussy
Buckeye Valley High School, Delaware OH, USA

Eastern plains garter snakes (Thamnophis radix radix) and eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sisturus catenatus catenatus) are listed as endangered on Ohio’s threatened and endangered species list and found in Killdeer Plains Wildlife Area (KPWA) in Wyandot County, Ohio, USA. Serious concerns exist regarding a decline in numbers of threatened and endangered snakes at KPWA. All roads in the KPWA were driven twice weekly during the fall and spring migration periods, March to June and August to November 2002. Snakes were identified, and location recorded by Global Positioning System. The days of the greatest activity may be linked to a decrease in temperature to at greatest 5°C, followed by an increase to at least 20°C in all fall periods of collection. The distribution of snakes across the collection period is different in the fall of 2002 than in the falls of 2001 and 2000. Temperature shifts appear to have a relationship with migrations. The number of snakes found in spring 2002 season was too few to draw statistical conclusions and may indicate a decrease in population. Brown snakes were found in habitats with a greater percentage of developed and woodland areas, water snakes in areas with a greater percentage of water and grasslands, and eastern garter snakes in areas with a greater percentage of agriculture. Using road surveys to assess the spring migration of snakes appears to not be adequate, so other survey methods would have to be employed.

The purpose of my project is to determine if a Drosophila Melanogaster's life span is increased,when given Heat Shock Treatment after being exposed to cryogenic temperatures.<br><br> After much research,I hypothesize that the life span of the Drosophila Melanogaster would increase when given heat shock treatment.<br><br> At the start of the experiment I began the boiling of my water for the pretreatment of the vials. The water was boiled at 121*Celsius. While the water was boiling, the anesthetizing of the Drosophila began. I placed 1 carbon dioxide tablet and 3 tablespoons of water into the anesthetic tube. Once all movement in the vial ceased,I then used the drosophila wand to transport the larvae to the filter paper.I dried the larvae on the filter paper and transported them fromthe filter paper to the experimental vials.When there were 10 larvae in each vial,I then placed a sponge lid into each vial.Next I put vials A,B,and D in the pretreatment water for 4 minutes.After 4 minutes passed,the vials were dried and placed into the freezer set at a -1*Celsius, thus ensuring them to freeze.Vial A remained in the freezer for 30 minutes,vial B for 15 minutes,and vial D for 7 1/2 minutes.Vial C was not tested in order to compare and contrast the effects of the heat shock factor.When 7 1/2 minutes passed I removed vial D for the freezer and immediately placed it in 121*Celsius water for 5 minutes.After 15 minutes vial B was immediately placed in 149*Celsius water for 7 1/2 minutes.After 30 minutes vial A was immediately placed in 177*Celsius water for 10 minutes.During the heat shock test, I prepared food vials for the larvae.When each time finished I placed the larvae into food vials,and began recording data.Vial C was kept at room temperature throughout the testing of my project.<br><br>

SHEDDING THE LIGHT ON GERBILS
Lee C. McDonald
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

The purpose of experimentation was to determine if different wavelengths of light had diverse effects on the living/eating habits of gerbils. I believed this experiment would prove that gerbils exposed to white light would react normally toward life and food, whereas those exposed to blue, red, green, an dyellow wavelengths of light, would have inconsistent results. All cages were exposed to 12 hours of light/12 hours of darkness: control -- white light only, cage 2 -- blue and green light alternated weekly and cage 3 -- red and yellow light alternated weekly also. Gerbils' mass was documented weekly. Gerbil's behavior was tested in a rodent ball whereby gerbils were measured for distance traveled within 60 seconds. Two behavior trials per animal were measured. Overall from week 1 to week 5, the Control Cage (white light) gained the most weight (18.1g), Cage 2 (blue/green light) gained 16.9g) and Cage 3 (red/yellow light) gained least (15.5g). In the two trials of behavior testing, the overall average distance by Cage 1 was 136.9 cm, Cage 2 was 249.0 cm, and Cage 3 was 80.2 cm. Overall, Cage 2 traveled, on average, the longest distance. I concluded that rodents are prone to eat more in white light, yet are more active in the blue and green wavelengths. In conclusion, a person that grooms pets could use red or yellow light in order to keep his "clients" calm during grooming.

Moberly High School, 1625 Gratz Brown, Moberly, Missouri 65270, U.S.A.

Introduction: I chose this project because my family is involved in the swine industry and each year we try to raise higher quality animals for lower production costs.<br><br>Problem Statement: Does the type of iron supplementaiton used in baby pigs at birth, effect the correlation between hematocrit count and the weight gain in the first twenty one days following birth?<br><br>Hypothesis: Since injectable iron enters the blood stream more directly, baby pigs in this group will exhibit higher hematocrit counts in correlation with weight gains.<br><br>Procedure: 1.) Identify pigs-ear notched, 2.) Determine supplementation groups, 3.) Weigh pigs on day one, 4.) Dock tails/draw blood, 5.) Spin blood in centrifuge, 6.) Record findings, 7.) Administer iron supplement, 8.) Weigh and record on days 7, 14, and 21, 9.) Draw blood on day 21, 10.) Spin blood in centrifuge, 11.) Record findings, 12.) Analyze results.<br><br>Results: Test results determined that the group of pigs who received injectable iron showed the highest increase in weight gain and hematocrit count. Results showed that the highest, most consistent correlation was in the injectable iron group. In all tests performed the injectable group proved superior.<br><br>Conslusion: The use of injectable iron resulted in higher hematocrit counts and weight gains. It also proved to have a higher, more consistent correlation. In both tests, oral iron closely followed injectable. The source of iron to use in small (non-corporate) operations would be injectable iron. My hypothesis on hematocrit count, weight gain, and correlation proved to be correct.

GONE FISHING
Kathryn Jolene Sanderlin
Drew Central Schools, Monticello, Arkansas, United States

The project was designed to determine which baitfish, the golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas, or the goldfish, Carassius auratus, would have the greater weight gain while being contained in an indoor tank and fed only commercial feed.<br><br>The hypothesis was the goldfish would have the greater weight gain of the two species.<br><br>The experiment was conducted in two different sites, one being a reasearch center and the other being my home. Experiment 1 was conducted at the Research Center with six tanks of twenty golden shiners. Experiment 2 was conducted in my home with four tanks of ten goldfish. Half of the tanks of each species will be fed Diet 1 and the other Diet 2. Diet 1 is a regular commercial feed and Diet 2 is the same feed with added fat. The fish were fed twice daily, three percent of their body weight. The weights and length were measured every two weeks.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON YOUR DOG'S THINKING ABILITIES
Nick B. Deeter
Helper Junion High School, Helper, Utah

Dogs think, just as humans do. I conducted an experiment to find when they think the best. Knowing when your dog thinks best can be very useful in training, obedience, and interaction. Humans think better after exercise; this is because more blood and oxygen are getting to the brain, and the metabolism is sped up, giving them more energy. I chose to use a Border collie for this experiment because of the breed's intelligence, energy, and cooperation. I either had the subject sit down or jump onto a platform 10 times. The, the subject was thrown a Frisbee for fifteen minutes. He then repeated the exercise. On the final two days I used a crossover (had him jump, exercise, then sit and vice versa) to prove he was thinking rather than memorizing the process. After four days of experimentation, I found that dogs think better after exercise. The subject trained better and had more energy following the exercise. This knowledge can be applied in obedience classes or home training. By adding an exercise period during training, the dog can think better and therefore train more easily.

THE EFFECTS OF CREATINE AND EPHEDRA ON THE MASS OF MICE
Douglas Stanley Weinberg, Yorktown High School, Arlington VA
USA

The problem being investigated was the potential hazards, most specifically body mass, associated combining creatine and ephedra. Vertebrate animals were used in experimentation so that the results could be correlated into potential hazards/benefits for humans. Mice (Mus musculus) were chosen as ideal candidates due to their hardiness and availability.<br><br> The hypothesis was that if creatine were administered to mice, their weight would increase. If ephedra is administered to mice, their weight will decrease. If both products are simultaneously administered to mice, the mice will gain weight.<br><br> The mice were divided into four groups of five mice each, control, ephedra only, creatine only, and ephedra and creatine. The mice were given a constant amount of food and water, and the experimental groups had a supplement added to their water. The mass of each mouse was to be taken every fifth day, for thirty days.<br><br> The control experienced a 0 percent change in body mass. The ephedra group experienced a decrease of 9.09 percent body mass. The creatine group experienced a 3.25 increase in body mass. The creatine and ephedra group experienced a 12.99 percent decrease in body mass.<br><br> The amount of ephedra used has a much higher effect on weight loss than does the same percentage increase of creatine usage. Their combination yielded massive weight loss most likely caused by the ephedra being stimulated by the creatine. Users of these products should consult a healthcare professional if using these products in conjunction or in excess of the recommended dosage.

COMPARATIVE BIOASSAY OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS ZEA MAYS POLLEN TO LEVELS OF ROAD DUST ON DANAUS PLEXIPPUS LARVAE
Rachael Theresa Collier
Mediapolis High School, Mediapolis, Iowa, United States

This experiment was designed to determine if monarch larval growth or mortality are effected by application of Bt corn pollen, a light application of limestone road dust, or a heavy application of limestone road dust to milkweed disks. It was hypothesized that a heavy application of road dust would be more toxic to monarch larva than either an application of Bt corn pollen or a light application of road dust.<br><br>Eighty petri dishes were prepared; each with two identically cut sterilized milkweed leaf disks. The dishes were grouped into four groups of twenty - an untreated control group and three groups treated with Bt corn pollen, a light application of road dust, or a heavy application of road dust respectively. A precisely measured amount of Bt corn pollen (one-tenth gram) suspended in acetone was micropipetted on each disk in the pollen group. The road dust was applied with a micropipette at levels commonly found on the top and bottom leaves of roadside common milkweed plants. Larval mortality was recorded every twelve hours. At ninety-six hours, the surviving larvae were counted and weighed. <br><br>The results of the experiment demonstrated that a heavy application of road dust acts as a toxin and results in increased larval mortality. A light application of road dust did not have a significant impact upon larval development, despite a slightly increased mortality. Bt corn pollen conclusively does not have a toxic effect on monarch larvae when compared to the control group. In conclusion, road dust is more toxic to monarch larvae than Bt corn pollen. Heavy levels of road dust act as a toxin and increases the rate of mortality of the monarch larvae. <br><br>

THE CONTINENTAL TURTLES OF COLIMA, MEXICO
Jacobo Reyes Velasco
Ricardo Jara #468, Colima, Mexico

The main purpose of this research is to know what species of non-marine turtles inhabit the state of Colima, located in the South Pacific coast of Mexico, also to know different aspects of their natural history that are little known in these species.<br><br>41 turtles were captured in different parts of the state using funnel traps. Four different species were identified (families Bataguridae, Kinosternidae & Emydidae). One more kind of turtle was identified (family Bataguridae) in 3 locations where they were kept in captivity. Nevertheless, of the 5 identified types of turtles, the existence of one kind of turtle living freely on the state wasn’t confirmed.<br><br>Some of the captured turtles were taken to an enclosure where they were kept under captivity to be able to observe some aspects of their natural history that otherwise would have been very hard to observe. It found that some sililarity in sexual dimorphism exist between the different species, but also some differences. It also found that some relation exists between the reproductive activity and the rainy season in all species confirmed to inhabit Colima.<br><br>The benefits of this investigation are several. It puts the bases for possible ecological studies and the impact of humans in their populations. The obtained data supplement the knowledge of these reptiles, because only little research on the natural history of turtles in this part of Mexico had been done before. The results can also help a possible sustainable use of the species mentioned in this work.<br><br>

MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN FEATHER MICROSTRUCTURE
Richard Winston Larson
Springville Junior High School, Springville, Utah, USA

Birdstrikes are a common occurrence in the United States, causing millions of dollars worth of damage to aircraft each year. Immediate birdstrike identification is crucial to implement measures to prevent additional birdstrikes in that area. Presently, all birdstrike remains must be sent to the Smithsonian Institution for identification. To aid in feather identification, research was done to determine the morphological differences in feather microstructures in the orders Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Charadriiformes, Psittaciformes, Columbiformes, Strigiformes, and Passeriformes. These orders were selected because they are the orders most commonly involved in birdstrikes and forensic cases and only represent bird orders in North America. Using a light microscope, feather pigments, pigment distribution, node shapes, node distribution, barbule lengths, villi, and node counts were observed in the orders listed above. Because the feather structures are transparent, a scanning electron microscope was also utilized to determine node shape and structure. The data derived from these observations showed definite differences in the characteristics described above. Similarities are also noticed in the feathers, especially between those families that are in the same order. Using the information gathered from the experiment and the analysis that followed, a dichotomous key was created, showing that the morphology of feather microstructure varies significantly between these bird orders by barbule length, node shape, pigment type, and node distribution. The dichotomous key developed, based on the research and analysis, is accurate.

GENDER SPECIFIC RECOMBINATION RATE DIFFERENCES IN THE ZEBRAFISH, DANIO RERIO
Anant Vinjamoori
Parkway Central High School, Chesterfield, Missouri, USA

In most organisms, the frequency of meiotic recombination is not uniformly distributed along the length of chromosomes between sexes. In particular, high recombination rates are thought to be present in male species near the telomeric regions of chromosomes, while recombination is nearly absent in these same regions in female species. To investigate this phenomenon further, we constructed genetic maps based on male and female meiosis in zebrafish on 2 representative telomeres. A meiotic mapping panel consisting of 192 male and 192 female meioses was assembled. The panel was scored for genetic polymorphisms using markers occurring every 5 cM from the centromere. We attempted to differentiate between male and female specific regions of recombination by determining a breakpoint on these 2 linkage groups below which recombination was nearly all male-specific. Clones of markers corresponding to these regions were then BLASTed against whole genome shotgun assemblies to screen for low-complexity sequence repeats We discovered three primary regions of recombination on each linkage group- a highly female specific region of crossover extending proximally towards the centromere, a “transition interval” in which male and female recombination rates are equal, below which a male specific region exists, extending distally to the telomere of the linkage group. BLASTN analysis revealed that the male meiotic zone was enriched with the “CATA” tandem repeat, the transition interval contained moderate levels of the repeat, and the female zone had very little trace of the motif. This suggests that male meiosis signals are affiliated with the “CATA” repeat.

MUTATING EFFECTS OF THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Maria Jujan Gomez
Escuela Normal J. G. de Cossio, San Roque, Corrientes, Argentina

The mutating capacity of different dosages of ultraviolet light, a radiation non-ionizated was analyzed; in different stages of the development of the fruit fly, Drosopila mlanogaster (larvae and eggs).<br><br>They wree used ace variable of study, dosages of ultraviolet radiation, calculated in Joule, of the type B and C and quantified in periods of times. The temperature was constantly in 25 degrees Celsius during the term day-night in periods of 12 hourse each one, so that these factors did not cause noise.<br><br>the results obtained demonstrated that the ultraviolet radiations, of the types B and C, in the working dosages, affected in a different way the normal development of the flies, causing such malformations as: vestigial wings and contracted wings observable in mature flies coming from irradiated eggs, not so in those coming from irradiated larvae, since the same ones died for the effects of the dosages of UVC and those coming from eggs irradiated with UVB did not present alterations exomofologic observables.<br><br>In order to verify if the detected alterations could be trasferable to other generations, crossbreeding were made among the individuals with normal wings and individuals with malformations, proceeded from the Filial 1 and 2; the analysis of 2a and 3a off-spring allowed to check that this alterations are not inheritable. The obtained results suggested that the ultraviolet radiations of the type B and C, in the worked dosages, caused alterations int he somatic cells, no so in the germinal cells.

CRUCIFEROUS PLATYHELMINTHES
Jennifer A. McDonough
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs CO, USA

Organic broccoli sprouts are cruciferous vegetables noted for their concentration of sulforaphane, one of nature’s most potent antioxidants. When the genes in a cell are damaged by free radicals and carcinogens, the cell may start dividing uncontrollably and possibly become cancerous. Sulforaphane activates the body’s Phase II enzymes, which destroy free radicals and carcinogens. <br><br> The purpose of this project is to determine if the sulforaphane, or some other antioxidant, in organic broccoli sprouts prevents or minimizes the formation of tumors and increases the survival rate of irradiated planaria (a type of roundworm). Forty planaria were tested using four different time spans (0-30 minutes three times a week) in which they were fed organic broccoli sprouts. All planaria ingested beef liver to control hunger, and were irradiated with 300 rems of radiation. <br><br> Planaria fed organic broccoli sprouts for the longest amount of time had the highest survival rate. Planaria not fed any broccoli had the lowest survival rate. No tumors were observed in any of the planaria. It can be concluded that planaria fed organic broccoli sprouts and beef liver have a higher survival rate than planaria only fed beef liver. <br><br> Cancer is on the rise, and researchers are looking for effective and practical cancer prevention methods. Information from this project can be used to develop an easily ingested sulforaphane-enriched supplement. In the meantime, individuals can consume broccoli sprouts to improve health. This also has economic implications since simple and inexpensive preventions will preclude agonizingly emotional and expensive consequences of cancer. <br><br>

OVERO LETHAL WHITE SYNDROME: PEDIGREE OR GENETIC?
Amanda Dawn Cook
Cody High School, Cody WY, USA

Overo Lethal White Syndrome is a genetic mutation in American Paint Horses designated in pattern defined as an "Overo". If the genetic mutation is inherited by both parents, a completely white foal results that will die within 24-48 hours from aganglionosis. The question lieing behind this study is whether or not the overo mutation is occurs in every overo paint horse or if the only certain overos carry the mutated genes and are designated as carriers. <br><br> The pedigree approach is used to test the first theory that every overo paint is a carrier. Done through surveys sent to registered paint horse breeders, they will report their first born foal of the last foaling season, its resulting pattern, and its parents' patterns.<br><br> The genetic approach will test the second theory that only certain overos are the carriers of the genetic mutation. Ten randomly selected, pre-tested overo stalliions, which have been tested by a certified genetics center, hadtheir test results analysed.<br><br> In regards to the pedigree approach, 33 surveys were returned. Of these, 10 resulting paint horse combinations resulted of which Overo to Overo was most prominent. 13% of the resulting foals were lethal whites.<br><br> In regards to the genetic approach, 10 stallions were selected. 50% of the stallions tested positive while the other half tested negative.<br><br> In conclusion, the pedigree approach supports that since a significant percentage less than 25% lethal foals was produced, not every overo is a carrier. The genetic approach supports the pedigree approach that not every overo horse is a carrier of the mutated gene. The importance is to show breeders that two overos can be bred as long as one is not a carrier.

SIMILAR SIBLINGS
Rachel Lindsey Stewart
Martin County HIgh School, Stuart, Fl, United States

In my previous project, I explored the relationship between an offspring’s fingerprints and those of his or her parents, concluding that fingerprints are inherited just over fifty percent of the time. This year, I am doing a further investigation of fingerprints within a family group by comparing the fingerprints of siblings.<br><br> In order to properly take fingerprints, I borrowed a fingerprint kit and forms from the Martin County Sheriff’s Department. I reviewed fingerprints taken from my previous project and made a list of other sibling groups that could be fingerprinted. I then obtained the additional fingerprints, trying to get approximately the same number of sister-sister, sister-brother, and brother-brother sets of fingerprints. Next, I analyzed the individual fingerprints and determined their type. I compared the prints of siblings in each set by counting how many fingers have prints of the same type. Finally, I calculated the overall percentage of siblings the match each other and further separated the matches by gender. <br><br> The overall average of similar fingerprints between siblings is 59.4% of all prints analyzed. Fingerprints were the most similar in the sister-brother group with 67.7%, followed by the brother-brother group with 60.9% and the sister-sister group with 49.2%. There were many similar sets of prints and even a few that matched on all ten fingers. 3% matched on ten fingers, 8% on nine, 8% on eight, 19% on seven, 17% on six, 17% on five, 22% on four, and 6% on three. There were no siblings that had no matches or matches on only one or two fingers.<br><br> It is clearly evident from the data in this project that individual fingerprint patterns do not just occur randomly but are closely related between siblings due to their common genetics. <br><br>

GENE EXPRESSION IN NORMAL AND ABNORMAL MOUSE EYE DEVELOPMENT
William John Russell Turk
Grant Park High School, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

In children, inherited eye diseases are the most common cause of blindness, after accidents. Understanding genes mutated in these disorders may help us with treatment. Homeobox genes are transcription factors that regulate development by affecting gene expression. DLX homeobox genes are expressed during development in several organs, including the brain and retina. Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout mice die as newborns (P0) with multiple birth defects, including cleft palate, skull and brain abnormalities. I am studying the role of DLX genes in the developing retina by studying the Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout mouse. The Dlx1/2 knockout retina shows reduced cellularity, especially in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). This suggests problems in cell differentiation, cell proliferation or programmed cell death (apoptosis). I first determined the normal patterns of expression of two cell cycle regulatory genes, p27 (KIP1) and p57 (KIP2) and compared them to DLX2. In adults, p27, p57 and DLX2 are localized to retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and cells of the inner nuclear layer (INL), but they do not show complete overlap. I then compared p27 and p57 gene expression, as well as activated Caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, in the retinas of Dlx1/2 double knockout mice and normal (control) littermates. My analysis of the Dlx1/2 mutant retina shows that both p27 and p57 are unaffected qualitatively at E13 (embryonic day 13.5) and P0. However, there is increased Caspase-3 expression in the GCL. Increased apoptosis is consistent with reduced GCL and optic nerve thickness in the retina of the Dlx1/2 mutant mouse.

CROSSING THE DIVIDE: USING ACOUSTICS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN FROG AND TOAD SPECIES
Simeon McMillan
Uniondale High School, Uniondale NY, USA

When classifying the thousands of different frogs and toads, there are often disputes over how they should be categorized. The emphasis of this year’s research was to determine what could be found by comparing the sound patterns of frog and toad species that were from two different continents, North and South America. Using the SpectraPRO sound analysis software, sound scans from approximately 220 different frog and toad species ranging over eleven different genera were analyzed for similarities in frequencies. The frequencies from two groups of frog species, from North and South America were overlapped to see if similarities existed between members of the same genus. It was found that the same dominant frequencies in the 1khz, 2khz, 3khz, 4khz, and 5khz ranges were found between the separated species. Only the frogs from the Amazon areas of South America omitted frequencies that were in the 7khz range. When the most dominant frequencies from two groups were compared, one often came up with very high R-squared values of 0.96 to suggest a strong correlation between certain transcontinental species, while values of 0.86 for weaker connections. The results showed that while thousands of miles separated certain species of frogs and toads, their similarities with others in their genus still came through. Their appearance and environment had changed over time, but their calls were still similar.

THE ROLE OF LEUKOCYTES IN THE EXACERBATION OF ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY IN HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC MICE
John Louis Gehrig
Caddo Parish Magnet High, Shreveport, Louisiana, U.S.A.

Hypercholesterolemia exacerbates dysfunctional responses to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Wild-type (C57) mice, lymphocyte-deficient (RAG1-/-) mice, and interferon-gamma-deficient (IFN-GAMMA-/-) mice were placed on either a normal (ND) or high cholesterol (HC) diet for one week. HC exacerbated I/R-induced leukocyte adhesion and emigration responses to I/R versus levels observed in normocholesterolemic wild-types. The RAG1-/--HC sample showed an attenuated response, implicating an important role for lymphocytes. However, leukocyte recruitment was restored in the RAG1-/--HCrecHC sample that received splenocytes from C57-HC mice. This occurred in the absence of restored circulating lymphocyte counts suggesting that a soluble factor, such as IFN-GAMMA, produced by the lymphocytes may be responsible. The IFN-GAMMA-/--HC sample also demonstrated decreased leukocyte recruitment; however, the response in the IFN-GAMMA-/--HCrecHC sample was restored. This implicates IFN-GAMMA as a cytokine that propagates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in this I/R model. Leukocyte adhesion and emigration were also attenuated by the administration of anti-neutrophil serum (ANS), as exemplified by the C57-HC+ANS sample. This indicates that the neutrophil may be the leukocyte population being recruited early on in this I/R model. Preliminary oxidative stress data suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production following I/R is a primarily lymphocyte-dependent; however, the role of neutrophils has yet to be elucidated. These findings implicate lymphocytes as major contributors to the exaggeration of post-ischemic microvascular inflammation by hypercholesterolemia, possibly by promoting neutrophil recruitment.

DO CORN SNAKES EXHIBIT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION?
Matthew Christopher Brandt
Waterloo High School, Waterloo, Illinois, United States of America

Purpose: The purpose of this experiment is to determine if temperature affects the sex of hatchling corn snakes.<br><br>Procedure: The way I conducted my experiment was to obtain the nine female and two male corn snakes from the Exotic Amphibian and Reptile Center. I bred the two males with the nine females. When each female laid her eggs, I divided them up equally and placed each group in separate incubators. One incubator was set at 25.5 degrees Celsius. The other incubator was set at 30.5 degrees Celsius. When they hatched I took them back to the Exotic Amphibian and Reptile Center to have them sexed.<br><br>Conclusion: Based on my results I have found my hypothesis to be supported. The temperature did appear to have an effect on the sex of the hatchlings. Four males and one female hatched at 25.5 degrees Celsius, and four females and one male hatched at 30.5 degrees Celsius.<br><br>

The length, width, and height of all mussels located within each sample were measured to determine average mussel size. We did not support our hypothesis that the closer the mussels were to fresh water creeks, the larger they would be on average. Factors contributing to variation in mussel size between sites could be beach orientation, stream direction or the duration of time between sampling each site.Consistent standard sampling methods within sites and large sample sizes used in this study provide baseline data for future evaluation of potential environmental impacts and feasibility of shellfish farming along Gastineau Channel.<br><br>WORD COUNT: 156<br><br>

LIMULUS POLYPHEMUS: MEASURING THE GROWTH RATE AND MOLTING FREQUENCIES
Gold Truong, Nicole Burgoyne
Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, NY, USA

The North American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, is an essential organism in the medicinal field. Their copper based blood, hemocyanin, has allowed intravenous medicines to be tested quickly for gram negative bacteria. Due to the decimation of the population, breeding in captivity has become an interest. This study on juvenile Limulus polyphemus dealt with measuring their growth rate and molting frequency. Three different sized horseshoe crabs were kept in separate cages and measured weekly. The duration of this project was eleven weeks. It was found that growth in between molts is negligible. Data showed that immediately after a molt, the horseshoe crab would increase in weight by 150% and in dimensions by 130%. This statistic coincides with the number of molts that occur in the lifespan estimated through other observations. It was also found that there is no definite molting pattern, however there are definite signals of a potential molt. This experiment provides foundational work for future studies accelerating the growth of juvenile horseshoe crabs. In addition this data could be used to breed in captivity horseshoe crabs solely for extraction of LAL (Limulus Ambocyte Lysate).

Three different sized horseshoe crabs were kept in separate cages and measured weekly. The duration of this project was eleven weeks. It was found that growth in between molts is negligible. Data showed that immediately after a molt, the horseshoe crab would increase in weight by 150% and in dimensions by 130%. This statistic coincides with the number of molts that occur in the lifespan estimated through other observations. It was also found that there is no definite molting pattern, however there are definite signals of a potential molt. This experiment provides foundational work for future studies accelerating the growth of juvenile horseshoe crabs. In addition this data could be used to breed in captivity horseshoe crabs solely for extraction of LAL (Limulus Ambocyte Lysate).

The North American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, is an essential organism in the medicinal field. Their copper based blood pigment, hemocyanin, has allowed intravenous medicines to be tested quickly for gram negative bacteria. Due to the decimation of the population, breeding in captivity has become an interest. This study on juvenile Limulus polyphemus dealt with measuring their growth rates and molting frequency. Three different sized horseshoe crabs were kept in separate cages and measured weekly. The duration of this project was eleven weeks. It was found that growth in between molts is negligible. Data showed that immediately after a molt, the horseshoe crab would increase in weight by 50% and in dimensions by 30%. This statistic is consistent with the number of molts that occur in the lifespan estimated through other observations. It was also found that there is no definite molting pattern, however there are definite signals of a potential molt. This experiment provides foundational work for future studies accelerating the growth of juvenile horseshoe crabs. In addition this data could be used to breed in captivity horseshoe crabs solely for extraction of Limulus Ambocyte Lysate (LAL).

GENETIC VARIATION IS INDUCED BY STRESS PROTEIN INHIBITION
Khannan Kameshvaran Athreya, Albert YT Wu, James YW Wu
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX, USA

During periods of increased stress, normally suppressed genes might be expressed to make adaptations. Increases in available phenotypes explain how a species can find certain advantageous adaptations during particularly stressful periods. The use of chemicals such as geldanamycin or radicicol renders the heat shock proteins ineffective by binding to them, causing hsp90 to bind incorrectly to many developmental control proteins. The ineffective chaperones may induce the expression of numerous phenotypes. The purpose of this project is to determine whether a reduction in available heat shock protein within a cell affects genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Geldanamycin and radicicol, hsp90 inhibitors, were used to induce greater variation. Wild flies were mated and the F1 and F2 generation were examined for variations in physical appearance to determine if the mutations are genetically linked. Furthermore, fruit flies were raised under stressful conditions such as elevated temperatures and hyperoxic environments. A gel electrophoresis was conducted to identify the changes in protein levels among these groups. For the F1 generation, the control group of flies eating normal food exhibited a mutation rate of 1.8%. Groups containing flies that were stressed in heat or oxygen and were also fed GDA or RAD had an average mutation rate of 21% (p<.01). The same trends were present in the F2 generation for all various groups. A gel analysis showed that the proteins that were enhanced in the control stressed flies were supressed in the flies that were fed chemicals. This signifies that stress proteins regulate genetic variation by producing an increase in exhibited phenotypes during a stressful period, allowing for the survival of the species as a whole.<br><br>

AN "EGG"CELENT PROBLEM
Justin Sieverding, Kyle Donnelly
Elk Point Jefferson Schools, Elk Point, South Dakota, USA

Team Members: Justin Sieverding, Kyle Donnelly<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>To begin our project we ordered 52 C. virginianus (Bobwhite Quail) eggs. Before we began to incubate the eggs we tested the volume of each of the eggs so we could maintain a consistent egg volume ratio in each of our incubators. After testing the volume of the eggs we placed the eggs into the incubators. In all the incubators we maintained the same temperature throughout, and only changed the humidity level. In incubator “A” we set the conditions to mirror theoretically perfect hatching conditions. In incubator “B”, we dropped the humidity factor by approximately twelve percent, to test how the eggs would react to a slight drought. For incubator “C”, we dropped the humidity by approximately twenty percent as compared to incubator “A”. This trial would test egg hatchability in a moderate drought with minimal rainfall. Finally, for incubator “D”, we dropped the humidity by approximately thirty percent from incubator “A”. Incubator “D” tested how a severe drought with minimal rainfall would affect the hatch of wild birds. The hatching period for C. virginianus is about 23 days, and during the 23-day hatching period the eggs have to be turned three times a day, everyday, until the eggs are about three days from hatching. At that point, the turning must be stopped so the chicks have an opportunity to position themselves for the hatch. After the hatch we were able to ascertain our conclusions on how drought affects the hatching characteristics of wild game birds.<br><br>

DO DIFFERENT SOUNDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR DETER SHARKS?
Kaitlin Maria Luther, Alana Yurkanin
H.P. Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, USA

The purpose of this project was to discover if different sounds have the ability to attract or deter sharks and possibly prevent attacks in the wild without harming the sharks or other species. The hypothesis states that sounds (beach noises, boat motor, dolphins, humpbacks, ‘Jaws’ theme, thunder and whistling) do affect sharks’ behavior. <br><br> After two months, the results showed that dolphin calls, boat motors, and thunder detract sharks. Based on this, we conclude that sharks fear their natural enemy, dolphins, and loud/low sounds (thunder/boat motors). Our research also suggests that sharks are attracted to whale sounds and whistling, because they like high-pitched noises. The “Jaws” theme and beach noises had little effect. One explanation is that they’ve never heard the “Jaws” theme and they are accustomed to the sounds of people at the beach and attack because of the physical invasion, rather than sound. <br><br> After examining our results, we concluded that our hypothesis was correct in that sounds do affect sharks’ behavior.<br><br>Through our project, we strove to find a use for our results. We hope to discover a sound effective in repelling sharks from beaches. By playing sounds in the water at popular areas, a sound barrier would be created, discouraging sharks from approaching beaches, and possibly preventing attacks. Although dolphins had the lowest average of attraction, they affected other species in the tank. Therefore, thunder (second lowest average of attraction) and being least disruptive to other species, would most likely be used in this situation.<br><br>

TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES: WHAT RELATIONSHIPS EXIST BETWEEN MAD COW DISEASE AND CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE?
Sara Rose Worsham, Jessica Marie Luck
Onsted High School, Onsted, Michigan, United States

This project’s purpose was to determine any possible links between Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease (BSE)) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). This study was important to attain information dealing with the health of wildlife and impacts on humans. <br><br> Links between BSE and CWD were determined using secondary analysis and personal interviews with professionals in this area studied. An autopsy of a cervid (deer/elk) brain was observed to understand the affects of TSEs. <br><br> Many relationships were discovered between BSE and CWD. One relationship was that high levels of manganese, combined with low levels of copper, caused a protein mutation called a prion (proteinaceous – infectious particle). Another relationship was both BSE and CWD originated in localized areas then spread regionally; a strong correlation was found between the spreads.<br><br> Most importantly, a relationship was discovered between BSE and the human TSE of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD). BSE and vCJD showed similar growth patterns based upon the data. It is to soon to tell whether or not CWD can cause vCJD in humans because of the approximate ten-year incubation period before the disease appears.<br><br> Strong relationships were found between BSE and CWD. This study was vital because there could be health and financial implications to North Americans if CWD follows the same patterns that BSE did in Europe.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CAFFEINE ON DAPHNIA MAGNA HEART RATE "GOT CAFFEINE?"
Nicole Adriana Sousa, Ismat Mohammad Yassin
Notre Dame High School, San jose, CA, USA

The purpose of our experiment was to investigate the effect of caffeine on heart rate. This was investigated in Daphnia magna because they are simple to handle and it is easier to create a uniform test environment. We hypothesized that if Daphnia magna were exposed to caffeine, their heart rate would increase. The Daphnia magna were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply Co., and caffeine (200 mg tablets) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Caffeine solutions were made by adding tap water to a crushed tablet of caffeine and diluting it, creating four solutions of 2,10, 20 and 40 mg caffeine / milliliter. The Daphnia were kept at constant temperature (20 degrees C) and all experiments were run between 1:30 and 4:30 PM. In the first set of experiments, Daphnia magna were placed on microscope slides and their heart beat counted for ten seconds; after adding a drop of caffeine solution and waiting 2 minutes, their heart beat was recounted. This was repeated 6 times for each concentration and data were averaged. In the second set of experiments, an electrolyte solution was used to dilute a caffeine tablet. It was used in place of tap water to minimize osmotic shock. 6 different Daphnia magna were added sequentially to differing solutions of caffeine. After two minutes, their heart rates were counted for 10 seconds. Results from both series of experiments showed that addition of caffeine increased the heart rate in a dose dependent manner, thus proving our hypothesis.

From April to August 2002 it was compared the specific composition and abundances of adult mosquitoes in green areas of Concordia city, Entre Ríos.<br><br>The work dealt with: the selection of five places in Concordia city which were clasified according with human intervention and the vegetable stratification in half-wild areas and parks, the trapping of adult mosquitoes on a biweekly basis in every green area selected, and the calculation of Shannon diversity index for the accumulated captures of fall and winter for each habitat.<br><br>It was hyphotetized that the diversity of mosquitoes is higher in the half - wild areas than in the parks during the fall.<br><br>Twelve species distributed in five genera were found: Culex eduardoi, Cx. pipiens, Ocherotatus crinifer, Cx. dolosus, Cx. maxi, Cx. chidesteri, Cx. brethesi, Oc. albifasciatus, Mansonia titillans, Psorophora pallecens, Ps. varipes and Anopheles albitarsis. The first three species have been the most abundant and frecuent.<br><br>The greatest diversity index was calculated for half - wild areas during the fall. Mean daily temperature and accumulated rainfalls records were higher in the fall than in the winter. Therefore, they could allow the green areas to offer a greater number of breeding sites for the immature stages development, as well as a large amount of feeding sources.<br><br>Diversity, richness and eveness were in any case lower for the parks than for the half - wild areas, although the highest values of them were obtained for the fall in every habitat.<br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF PANTALA HYMENAEA ON POST-LARVAL AND JUVENILE PENAEUS VANNAMEI
Ryan Keith Hamilton, Nick Roy Symon
Demopolis High School, Demopolis Alabama, United States

The project was designed to determine whether or not dragonfly nymphs (Pantala hymenaea) prey upon post-larval and juvenile shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). During two one week trials, the experiments were conducted at a local shrimp farm outside of Forkland, Alabama in Greene County. For the first trial, nine tanks measuring 153 cubic feet were stocked with 200 post-larval shrimp each. There were three treatments established: control (no nymphs), normal density (7 nypmhs), and double density (14 nymphs). The tanks were covered with a protective nylon net. At the end of the week, the tanks were drained and the shrimp were counted. During the second week, a second trial was performed. During this trial, six tanks were stocked with 200 juvenile shrimp. Only two treatments were tested: control (no nymphs) and double density (14 nymphs). The results from the first trial showed a noticeable decline (56% mortality rate) in the double density post-larval shrimp population, a 43% mortality rate in the normal density post-larval shrimp population compared to a 7% mortality rate in the control for the post-parval treatment. In the juvenile population, a 29.5% mortality rate was observed in the double density treatment compared to a 4.5% mortality rate in the control for this treatment. Statistically, the control group in Trial 1 differs from the normal density and double density groups, but the normal density and double density groups do not differ from one another. Because of errors in Trial 2 (shrimp were not counted accurately), statistical tests were not performed.

THE EFFECT OF LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS ON SOIL BULK DENSITY AND SOIL NUTRIENT CONTENT IN WORM WORKED VS. NON-WORM WORKED SOILS
Kirsti Hakala, Jillian Beaufeaux 
Cloquet High School, Cloquet, Minnesota, United States of America

Lumbricus terrestris (an earthworm) is an exotic species to Minnesota and was not officially documented until 1972 in a paper written by G. E. Gates. This lead to the question: “What is happening in the soil that is affecting the forest understory?” The hypothesis is if Lumbricus terrestris is introduced into a deciduous vs. a coniferous soil, then the soil nutrient content in both soils will be affected; also the bulk density in the deciduous soil will increase at a greater rate than the coniferous soil. Twenty, 2 liter plastic experimental chambers were filled with reconstructed forest floor material from a deciduous and coniferous forest. Eight Lumbricus terrestris were placed into ten of the twenty trial chambers. The soil bulk density and soil nutrient content were taken before and after the worms were introduced. The worms worked both soils for a nine-week trial period. The hypothesis was supported, the bulk density of both soil types significantly increased when worms were added and allowed to work the soil for nine weeks, with a p less than 0.001 using an ANOVA test. The deciduous soil’s bulk density increased more than the coniferous soil with a p less than 0.05. Soil calcium and magnesium increased in both soil types while chloride decreased. This experiment will increase ecologist’s understanding of biological invasions of Lumbricus terrestris and their affect on forest ecosystems and soil properties. Future experiments will compare the effect worms have on soil chemistry through their gut-associated processes (GAP) and nutrient enrichment processes (NEP).

HOW FAR WILL THE “MOLE CRICKET NEMATODE”(STEINERNEMA SCAPTERISCI) SPREAD FROM ITS ORIGINAL INFECTION PLOT IN ONE YEAR’S TIME? (A FOUR-YEAR STUDY)
Tyler Ashton Gary
DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida, United States

Florida cattlemen are seeking a cost-effective and permanent solution to the damage caused by non-indigenous mole crickets on bahiagrass in Florida. Approximately 75% of the 3.5 million acres of improved pastures that support the 1.2 million-head cow-calf industry in Florida consist of bahiagrass pastures. Since 1996, about 400,000 acres of bahiagrass pasture have been destroyed by mole cricket infestation. In addition, mole crickets have caused an annual loss of $6 million in bahiagrass hay revenue.<br><br> Six sound traps were used in collecting the pest mole crickets for this experiment. Two ranch locations were utilized in this study. These ranches were six miles distant from each other. Three sound traps were used on each ranch - one in the center of the original infection plot, one at ½ mile, and one at ¾ mile away from the infection plot. <br><br> <br><br>The results of this study suggest that the nematode spread beyond the infection site by at least a distance of ¾ mile by being transported by infected pest mole crickets. The data from this study suggest that infected mole crickets can fly at least ¾ mile distant from where they became infected and establish the nematode into the soil. <br><br>The “mole cricket nematode” (S. scapterisci) can survive in the soil on bahiagrass pasture for at least one year. The application of the “mole cricket nematode”(S. scapterisci) is an effective biological control alternative for pest mole crickets.<br><br>

DOES VITAMIN B HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE REGENERATION OF PLANARIA?
Devonne Rochelle Collins
DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida, United States 

The researcher conducted this experiment to determine if planaria would regenerate faster and result in a more correctly shaped specimen when vitamin B-100 complex was added to their aquatic habitat.<br><br> The researcher hypothesized that the group of planaria in which the vitamin B-100 complex was added would regenerate faster and result in more correctly shaped specimens than those that were allowed to regenerate with no supplements added.<br><br> Fifty planaria were separated into two groups of 25 each. Using a straight-edge razor, the planaria were sectioned into two pieces just below the "head". In the variable group, 25 tablets of vitamin B-100 complex was added to two-liters of pond water which provided the variable group's environment. In the control group, the planaria were allowed to regenerate with no supplements added. It was then determined which group regenerated faster and more completely. <br><br> Planaria introduced to the vitamin B-100 complex regenerated faster than planaria with no supplements added. The variable group resulted in 92% head regrowth and survival rate. 4% measured 6 mm, 68% measuered 7 mm, 20% measured 8 mm, and only 8% died. The control group resulted in 80% head regrowth and survival. 44% measured 6 mm, 36% measured 7 mm, and 20% died.<br><br> As a result of this experiment, it was found that planaria regenerate faster if introduced to vitamin B-100 complex.

THE EFFECTS OF ALTERED FOOD LEVELS DURING THE LARVAL PERIOD ON DEVELOPMENTAL RATES OF HYLA SQUIRELLA (SQUIRREL TREE FROG)
Sarah Jane Tynes
Land O' Lakes High, Land O' Lakes, Florida, United States

This study was an attempt to determine the immediate effects of altered food availability on developmental rates (change in Gosner stage over time) of Hyla squirella, squirrel tree frog, during the larval period. Experimentation consisted of two treatment food levels, one ensuring the test subjects would be food-limited but not inhumanely stressed, the other ensuring an over-abundance of food available for consumption. From the hatchling stage until metamorphosis, defined as one or both forelimbs having emerged from the body, individuals were weighed and staged on a weekly basis. Food rations were altered according to mean body sizes per egg mass so as to maintain the requirements of each treatment and validity of the study. <br><br>It was concluded that increased food availability during the larval phase results in larger individuals with increased developmental rate (metamorphosing earlier,) while decreased food availability yields smaller individuals with decreased development (metamorphosing later).

STEM CELLS AND VITAMIN C: DIFFERENTIATION OF MOUSE ES CELLS INTO HEPATOCYTES AND CARDIAC MYOCYTES IS ENHANCED BY ASCORBIC ACID
Elizabeth Cook
Canterbury School, Ft. Myers, Florida, USA

Heart and liver disease are leading causes of death. The purpose of this research is to thus determine if ascorbic acid will enhance the differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells into cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes. This researcher hypothesizes that increased levels of ascorbic acid will enhance differentiation of Mouse ES cells into cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes.<br><br>A GFP gene was inserted into the Mouse ES Cells. Four experimental groups were treated with increased amounts of ascorbic acid (10-7, 10-6, 10-5, and 10-4 mol/liter). Ascorbic acid was not added to the control group of stem cells. The researcher harvested DNA, performed PCR, and ran electrophoresis to check gene expression of cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes. Using a phase contrast microscope and fluorescent light, cells were analyzed for morphology and hepatic differentiation. Cardiac myocyte differentiation was observed through the number of cell cluster beatings. <br><br>Increased levels of ascorbic acid did enhance differentiation in cardiac myocytes, as found through the positive expression of Nkx2-5, Brachyury, GATA-4, and á-MHC. By Day 12, cardiac myocytes had begun beating. The number of beating clusters correlated with increased amounts of ascorbic acid.<br><br>Increased levels of ascorbic acid also enhanced differentiation of hepatocytes, as found through the positive expression of TTR, á-fetoprotein, Albumin, and GATA-4. Using the phase contrast microscope, a positive correlation was found between increased amounts of ascorbic acid and the expression of the GFP gene. The researcher concludes that ascorbic acid did enhance both cardiac myocyte and hepatocyte differentiation.<br><br>

AS THE WORM TURNS
Jon Roger Fichtelman
Vero Beach High, Vero Beach, Florida, USA

The objective of this experiment is to determine the effects of varying the levels and direction of gravity on fresh water planaria during their regeneration process.<br><br> To accomplish this, planaria are cut and placed in altered gravity situations to observe both the time sequence and pattern of their regenerative process. Control planaria are cut and allowed to regenerate at a constant force and direction of gravity at sea level (1g).<br><br> The altered gravity atmosphere is created using a clinostat. This device utilizes two simultaneous perpendicular planes of rotation. When placed on the radiating spokes of a bicycle wheel representing one plane, the planaria are denied orientation and experience altered gravity. The formula to determine the level of force on the planaria placed on the wheel spokes is Ac=w²R .<br><br> Anatomic criteria are developed and the rate and pattern of regeneration in control vs. experimental planaria is monitored with photography. The speed of rotation is also varied. The planaria are preserved, and microscopic slides are made to compare the cellular detail of control vs. experimental planaria.<br><br> While normal planaria regeneration at 1g can be viewed as a benign or limited neoplastic process, rotated planaria microscopically demonstrate significant histologic differences which mimic malignant neoplasia. Clinorotation and the altered gravity it produces may be viewed as a mutagenic agent.<br><br> The findings of this report describe how altered gravity causes significant gross and microscopic abnormalities in the pattern of regeneration.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF LEAD ON NEUROLOGICAL MODELS: MOTOR NEURON PROFICIENCY, LEARNING AND MEMORY RETENTION, NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, AND GLIAL CELL FUNCTION
Kristen Elaine Fenska
Miami High School, Miami OK, United States 

Mining for heavy metals have resulted in abandoned mine shafts and towering chat piles that are major sources of contamination in Northeastern Oklahoma. While the EPA has determined that there is no safe level of lead intake, people continue to be exposed to this hazardous toxin. The developing nervous system is especially vulnerable to heavy metal exposure, which can cause damage neuronal and glial cells. This study focuses on the implications of low-level lead on three neurological models: motor neuron proficiency, learning and memory retention, and glial cell function. It was hypothesized that lead would decrease motor neuron proficiency in Drosophila melanogaster; decrease learning and memory retention in regenerated Dugesia tigrina; and inhibit glial cell function. Drosophila cultures were exposed to lead acetate concentrations (1.25-20 ppb) during development from egg/larva to adult. Motor abilities of Drosophila were determined by escape and exploratory responses. The exposed flies showed decreased motor abilities in both tests (p=0.001). Planaria were trained using classical conditioning techniques, placed in lead concentrations for a seven-day regeneration period, and tested for memory. Results indicated that exposure to lead showed decreased memory retention. The control indicated 98.3% retention while the lead exposed planaria retention varied from 86.6% to 33.3% (p= 0.001). EOC-20 Glial cell cultures were evaluated for the effects of lead on the amount of nitrite (NO2–) produced in the presence of TNFá (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha. As the lead concentration increased, the glial cell activity, as measured by the production of nitrite, significantly decreased. Furthermore, if glial cell function is impaired by lead exposure, their ability to protect and support the brain could also be diminished.<br><br><br><br>

Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) corn is a plant that has been genetically engineered to resist insect damage from the European corn borer. It is found throughout the nation as well as in various places in Northeastern Colorado. This plant has brought about many concerns since its use in agriculture. One concern is with the monarch butterflies. The use of this corn is also a concern of ranchers that might feed their livestock this genetically engineered corn.<br><br>The experiment was designed to test the effect of genetic engineered Bt corn kernels on four different types of insect genera which were tobacco hornworms, fruit flies, milkweed bugs, and mealworms. The study had many tests to measure the insects' physiology for strength and reaction to various stimuli.<br><br>The experiment showed that the Bt corn had a large effect on the insects' physiology. The Bt groups of insects did worse in the majority of the tests including exhibiting a higher death rate. In the total tests that were done on the insects, the Bt corn group ranked lowest in 67% of the tests that were conducted.<br><br>The results of the study indicate that insect physiology is impacted by the use of Bt corn. More research should be done to quantify other animal species.

"GONE FISHING AGAIN"
Kathryn Jolene Sanderlin
Drew Central High School, Monticello, Arkansas, USA

Feeder goldfish (Carassius auratus), account for approximately $9 million in the aquaculture industry. The weight study from last year revealed digestibility issues with commercial feed with 10% increase in lipid content. Producers of commercial feed use high protein levels and fat levels to produce rapid growth in feeder fish.<br><br> The digestibility study and isotope analysis were conducted to compare the assimilation of lipid addtitives in two different forms, triglycerides versus phospholipids. Analysis was performed on feces collected over a period of eight weeks for lipid and fiber content. A whole body analysis was performed using a stable carbon isotope tracer. The hypothesis was that the goldfish would assimilate a higher level of phospholipids over the triglycerides.<br><br> Two groups of goldfish(Carassius auratus) were fed two diets with the two forms of lipid additives. The digestibility diets contained a 10% increase in lipids in the forms of phospholipids and triglycerides. The iotope analysis diets contained a 14% increase in lipids and the stable isotope. The study was conducted for a period of eight weeks.<br><br> The apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) and isotope analysis revealed no significant difference in the assimilation of lipid content in the feces and body fat between the two forms of lipids. However, the study did reveal a significabnt weight gain with less body fat. This information can be useful in the production of food fish containing less fat content to be consumed by humans.

POPULATION AND SPECIES DIVERSITY IN RELATIONSHIP TO LOCATION AND ELEVATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF COSTA RICAN TARDIGRADES
Clayton Benjamin Marshall
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN, USA

This project was designed to determine tardigrade population and diversity in relationship to elevation, latitude and longitude in Costa Rica. It was hypothesized that if tardigrade samples were collected from Costa Rica, then the population and species diversity would vary due to elevation and location. Lichen samples were collected from high and low altitude regions in Costa Rica. The exact locations were measured using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The tardigrades were viewed and counted using a steriomicroscope. Tardigrades were removed and placed in ethanol. The preserved tardigrades were mounted, and an Oil Immersion microscope was used for identification. The tardigrades that were not mounted were genetically analyzed using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at Hanover College. The species identified were Macrobiotus areolatus, Macrobiotus ascensionis, Macrobiotus occidentalis, Diphascon rugosum, and one unidentified species. There were 43 total tardigrades found on low altitude samples. There were 310 total tardigrades found on high altitude samples. The low altitude tardigrade population and species diversity were analyzed using a T-test and was found to be highly significant at the 0.008 level. High altitude tardigrade population and species diversity were analyzed using an ANOVA and were found to be significant at the 0.02 level. The total tardigrade population between low and high altitude was statistically analyzed using a T-test and was found to be highly significant at the 0.0004 level. The tardigrade species diversity was statistically analyzed using an ANOVA and was found to be highly significant at the 0.0007 level. Based upon the data collected the hypothesis was supported.

EFFECTS OF OIL CONTAMINATION ON DAPHNIA PULEX
Brooke Nicole Westmoreland
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro AR, US

This project was conducted in order to see what effects oil contamination had on Daphnia pulex. There were two different trials run using a different method in each. Both were used to determine death rate and to test the water chemistry at the end of the experiment.<br><br> Twenty-four cups were placed in six rows of four. Then, six beakers filled with moderate hard water were either left alone or filled with .25%, .50%, .75%, 1.0%, or 1.5% of oil, and five Daphnia pulex were placed into each. Two days later the Daphnia pulex were checked to determine survival rate, and the water was tested with the pH/EC/TDS/Temperature digital meter. Another test was run on a different group of Daphnia pulex containing a control group, and rows with one drop, five drops, and ten drops of oil. Then five Daphnia pulex were put into each cup. At the end of three days the water in each row was tested with the pH/EC/TDS/Temperature digital meter.<br><br> The only group without any deaths was the control group. Then in the .25% six of the twenty Daphnia pulex died, and twelve out of twenty in the .50%. In the .75%, 1.0%, and 1.5% all of the Daphnia pulex were killed. As for the second trial, in the group with one drop of oil one out of twenty survived, and the groups with five and ten drops, none survived. Obviously oil contamination had a detrimental effect on the Daphnia, and will most likely other aquatic organisms.<br><br>

WAGING WAR ON WEST NILE VIRUS: SEARCHING FOR PYRETHROID RESISTANCE IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY MOSQUITOES
Samantha Marie Zimmerman
Beaumont School, Cleveland Heights OH, USA

West Nile Virus (WNV) entered the United States in 1999. Since then this mosquito-transmitted disease has spread throughout the United States, and human cases are now present in 45 of the 48 contiguous states. Public health measures to combat WNV include controversial mosquito control through the spraying of pyrethroid pesticides. There is concern that spraying pyrethroids may serve to select for pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes. One mutation has been found in a laboratory strain of mosquitoes that confers pyrethroid resistance. As pyrethroid resistance may be due to a variety of mutations, testing the phenotype of the mosquito provides a more adequate assessment of the mosquito’s sensitivity to pyrethroids than genotyping. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a field test to screen for pesticide resistance. After collecting mosquito egg rafts, adult mosquitoes were successfully raised for use in the WHO pesticide resistance experiments. Mosquitoes were tested for sensitivity to permethrin, a pyrethroid commonly used to control adult mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were generally killed in a dose dependant fashion between 0.09% to 0.75% permethrin. The results of six WHO pesticide resistance experiments showed a variation in the response patterns of mosquitoes to increasing doses of permethrin, as some mosquitoes exhibited reduced susceptibility to permethrin. In addition, 2% of the mosquitoes exposed to 0.75% permethrin survived for 24 hours. These surviving mosquitoes meet the WHO definition of permethrin resistance.

A SECOND YEAR ANALYSIS OF TROUT HYBRIDIZATION: ELECTROPHORETIC EVALUATION OF PROTEINS
Michael Paul Coyne
Greybull High School, Greybull, Wyoming, United States

Management policies for fish populations vary from state to state, but do tend to have one common aspect. These policies are designed to address pure populations. This is also true of those policies covering the Buffalo Bill Reservoir and its tributaries. Though many people have suggested the likelihood of hybridization, no strong evidence has been published concerning the genetic proof of such interactions. When these fish are caught their identity is usually determined by outward appearance, but are these fish really what they appear to be? The purpose of this project is to gather proteomic evidence on several fish of each trout species Rainbow and Cutthroat from the Buffalo Bill Reservoir. The results of this proteomic analysis will be used to validate the degree of hybridization in the reservoir. This information could then be used to adjust management plans to better control native Cutthroat and non-native Rainbow populations. To determine whether or not hybridization is occurring tests will be run from fin clippings, from both the Rainbow and Cutthroat. These tests will be run on PAGE gels to determine different types of banding. Results indicate that Rainbow and Cutthroat are showing traits produced through hybridization. The base pair range for Cutthroat Trout seems to be shifted downward from the pure strain, which has bps (base pairs) at 280,000 down to 42,000. The unknown Cutthroat has a bp range of about 79,000 to 29,000. This is showing a downward shift of the unknown Cutthroat from its native purity as the entire unknown Cutthroat’s bps starts below 80,000. The Rainbow Trout has bps starting around 28,000 and continuing nearly to 179,000 bps. Rainbow Trout seems to be shifting into the base pair range of the pure Cutthroat trout. This evidence indicates that the Rainbow and Cutthroat stocks for NW Wyoming are hybridizing with each other. This could provide some valuable information for development of management plans for these important fish populations.<br><br><br><br>

"EXPLORING THE ROLE OF PROTEIN TAILORING IN MUSSEL ADHESION"
Edwin Anthony Krumeich
Croton-Harmon, Croton-on-Hudson NY, USA

The ability to adhere opportunistically to many different surfaces with such durability and longevity has made mussels a large fouling problem in many industries. The complex ways in which a mussel adheres to a surface are due to the usage of many different foot proteins that are available to the mussel which aid in the formation of a plaque that will allow the mussel optimal adhesion to any given surface. In Mytilus californianus the interfacial protein fp3 was studied. The ability to tailor this protein post-translational through the hydroxylation of tyrosine and arginine into dihydroxyphenylalanine and hydroxyarginine, respectively, was investigated in a study of the net hydroxylations that occurred on PMMA, glass, and steel. Through the use of laser desorption there was a detection of surface specific patterns of differential hydroxylation that were illustrated by the movement of the number of hydroxylations that were most suitable for adhesion on each surface by each mussel. While the mussels did not develop a consistent pattern of hydroxylation on PMMA, there was a mean difference in the m/z values between glass and steel of 13.1 mass units, and 16.95 mass units after a 10% trimmed mean. Results suggest that the mussel’s adhesive versatility may be due to the ability of Mytilus californianus to develop a tailored response on fp3 depending on the surface present.

THE NORTH SLOPE OF ALASKA AND HER CARIBOU
Susan Edwardson
Barrow High School, Barrow Alaska, USA

Four caribou herds intersect on the North Slope of Alaska’s Brook’s Range- the Western Arctic, Central Arctic, Teshekpuk, and the Porcupine. The herds are categorized according to migratory paths. The genetic variability of each herd, the topic of my study, is still undetermined.<br><br> The procedures I used were DNA Extraction; Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which involves isolating and amplifying a gene—the DQA gene; and PCR Purification.<br><br> I successfully isolated two Teshekpuk liver samples into sequences but only one was usable. The University of Alaska Fairbanks sent a six-sequence library of Porcupine samples to compare to the Teshekpuk sequence. <br><br> The Teshekpuk sequence had a genetic variability of 0% compared with one of the Porcupine sequence. The Teshekpuk sequence analyzed against the remaining Porcupine sequences, showed a genetic variability of 3.5 %. This was below the 5.5% average of the six Porcupine sequences <br><br> Although my sample size was small I was able to conclude that the Teshekpuk caribou sample I studied was genetically related to the Porcupine herd. Further experimentation on various samples of Teshekpuk caribou could validate the theory that the two populations belong to the same herd. <br><br> The genetic varability of northern Alaskan caribou is important in light of the current debate over oil-drilling in the region. Proposed drilling in the calving area, of the Teshekpuk herd, for example, could eliminate an entire population if their gene pool is unique. Continued research on this issue is essential.<br><br>

ANTIOXIDANT: A SURVIVAL ENHANCER
Yvette Corina Lopez
Taos High School, Taos, New Mexico (USA) 

Experimentation was directed to determine what effect four common over the counter antioxidants would have on the biological system of aquatic gastropods when pre and post treated with the antioxidants and exposed to UV light. It was hypothesized that the antioxidants will absorb/neutralize the free radicals generated by the UV light in the gastropods, thereby maintaining a low mortality rate and an enhanced species survival rate.<br><br> The chemicals utilized in this experiment are Proanthocyanidins(PA), Curcumoids (CC), Pycnogenol (PN), and Alpha Lipoic Acid (Alpha LA). Solutions (1x 10-4 g/mL)of each antioxidant were prepared. In the control portion of the experiment, gastropods were not exposed to UV light but were subjected to the four antioxidants. Three Experimental Sets were exposed to UV light and post treated with antioxidants. Exp. Set 4 was pretreated with the antioxidants prior to being irradiated with UV light. Exp. Set 1 was exposed once to the UV light, Exp. Set 2 was exposed to UV light for five consecutive days, Exp. Set 3 was exposed to UV light for ten consecutive days, and the Exp. Set 4 which was the pretreatment (PT) was exposed to UV light one time only. <br><br> Experimental sets exposed to UV light and treated with PA and PN resulted in significantly higher production of egg sacs. The snail activity increased in direct proportion to the amount of UV light exposure.<br><br> Pretreatment with antioxidants prior to UV light exposure had a significant increased birth rate. The PN post-treated snails had the single most significant increase in the birth rate. The CC seemed to have the least effect on birth rate under all conditions. These results are indicative of an increased chronogonadotropin hormonal level in the gastropods, which is evident by the increased egg sac production and consequently higher birth rate.

INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NIPPOSTRONGYLUS BRASILIENSIS (NEMATODA) AND EIMERIA FALCIFORMIS (APICOMPLEXA) IN MICE
Gabriel Joel Mendoza
Americas High School, El Paso, TX, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how the reproductive capability of the parasites Eimeria falciformis and/or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis would be affected in concurrently infected mice. The Nippostrongylus brasiliensis inoculum was prepared, and the anesthetized Group I mice were infected with the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis inoculum. Then the Eimeria falciformis inoculum was prepared, and the anesthetized Group II mice were infected with .05 ml of the Eimeria falciformis inoculum. Mice in Group III were infected with both parasites. Fecal samples from all mice were collected, processed, and analyzed under a microscope. Eggs from the fecal samples of each mouse were counted in Group I. Oocysts were counted in fecal samples of each mouse in Group II. Both oocysts and eggs were counted in each fecal sample of concurrently infected mice in Group III.<br><br> Since egg production ceased by Day 10 in the Control Group I infected singly with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, it can be concluded that Eimeria falciformis caused prolonged egg production when concurrently administered with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In addition, it can also be concluded that in the concurrent infection Nippostrongylus brasiliensis affected Eimeria falciformis. Although a longer life cycle did not occur in Eimeria falciformis, the reproduction rate was increased as the number of oocysts produced increased by over 649% from the Control Group II to the concurrent infection. A statistical analysis using 2-Sample T-Tests resulted in the statistically significant P-values of .0017 and .04 for this experiment.<br><br>

DO TRACE MINERALS LOWER SOMATIC CELL COUNT?
Lucas Steven Sjostrom
Gibbon-Fairfax-Winthrop High School, Winthrop, Minnesota, United States

The experiment was to lower the somatic cell count and thus raise the income and health of dairy herds. After doing a statistical test I concluded that there was too high of a variance to determine whether or not to accept my hypothesis.<br><br>The experiment consisted of two groups of 25 cows, the tested group was given a product that consisted of an alfalfa base, cobalt, manganese, copper, and zinc, while the other group was for control. We fed 1/4 ounce per head per day of the product to the tested side for 60 days. Every other day (we would have done it more often but it was not feasible) we measured the SCC(somatic cell count) and compared the results. <br><br>Also, a blood titer test was taken. This was taken before, 4 weeks into, and after the test, to see if there was added levels of the minerals in the blood. There was no difference in minerals in the blood between the test and control groups.

CULEX ERRATICUS MOSQUITOES AS OVER-WINTERING AGENTS OF WEST NILE VIRUS
John Benjamin Marshall
Statesboro High School, Statesboro, Georgia, United States of America

The question being addressed in this project is “Can the Culex erraticus mosquitoes of my region be over-wintering agents of West Nile Virus?” The hypothesis is that this mosquito population cannot maintain WNV over the winter. WNV has been in my region for three years, and I am searching for what holds WNV as activity goes dormant each year in the winter.<br><br>My first sample was collected October 19, and I collected each week until December 21. This allowed for five samples from two separate bridges. At a biology lab at Georgia Southern University, I identified and separated out the female Culex erraticus mosquitoes and dissected out their ovaries. By observing if the tracheoles in the ovaries were coiled or not, I determined if the mosquitoes had laid eggs (a process called age grouping) and recorded my data.<br><br>WNV activity directly corresponds to the mosquito breeding season. Mosquitoes need the nutrients from a blood meal to lay eggs and are, therefore, most actively biting during this time. If the mosquito’s ovary is parous (the mosquito has laid eggs), it has to have taken a blood meal and is capable of carrying the virus. All 102 mosquitoes I dissected were nulliparous. This means that the Culex erraticus population represented by this sample had not laid eggs or fed on blood, and, therefore, cannot over-winter the virus. This supported the hypothesis. The species Culex erraticus was chosen because it is one of the most common over-wintering species in my area.<br><br>

REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES IN THE MONOGYNONS AND POLYGYNONS OF SPINY WEAVER ANTS, POLYRHACHIS DIVES.
Ying-Siou Chen
No.165, Sec. 1, Chongcing S. Rd., Jhongjheng District, Taipei City 100, Taiwan.

It was reported previously that various ant species such as Monomonum pharaonis, Formica rufa, and Lasius niger, showed that coexistence of polygyny and monogyny colonies. In polygyny colony, the high heredity variability of filial generation could be expected, but what could the monogyny colony do to hold the high heredity variability in order to increase the fitness? The purposes of present investigation are to study the sex ratio and reproductive strategies of colony of spiny weaver ants, Polyrhachis dives. The result showed that the primary sex ratio (queen+worker/male+queen+worker) is lower than that of operation sex ratio either in polygyny or monogyny. However the reproductive sex ratio (queen/queen+male) of pologyny is higher than that of monogyny. It is interesting to find that the workers can ley eggs and produce male only which will make the lower reproductive sex ratio of monogyny or pologyny. Since the ratio of workers in monogyny is usually higher than that of pologyny, the reproductive sex ratio of monogyny is lower that of pologyny which will lead to higher heredity variability among filial generation of monogyny.

<br><br>The purpose of my project is to determine the effects of multi-thermal environments on Drosophila Melanogaster, when HSP90 is suppressed.<br><br>After researching, <br><br> I believed that there will be mutations. I also believed that the mutations could be predicted by the temperatures. Last I believed the mutations would carry on to the F2 drosophila. <br><br>First I anesthetized the Drosophila by using the Fly Nap. When the Drosophila were anesthetized I then extracted three males and females and placed them into the hot environment, labeled environment 1. I then extracted three more males and females and placed them into the cold environment, labeled environment 2.Once the Drosophila were put into their selected environments, I inserted 3u/mL of Geldanamycin into each environment. When the Drosophila had been exposed for 30 minutes I placed them into their temperatures. The Drosophila remained in the environment for one week. When time had expired I removed environments 1 and 2 from the temperatures and anesthetized them once again. I placed the environment 1 Drosophila onto a Petri dish to be analyzed under the microscope. When the data of environment 1 was collected, I analyzed environment 2. Next I placed the Drosophila back into their environments and watched for signs of reproduction. When the larvae reached the adults stage I examined them for the same mutation as the F1 Drosophila. I recorded the data and tested again. <br><br>In the end I found my hypothesis to be correct. Heat shock protein can be manipulated to produce different mutations.

DO DIFFERENT SALTS AFFECT THE GROWTH OF BRINE SHRIMP?
Emily Jean Tollefson
Washington High School, Tacoma, WA, United States

The purpose of this project is to see if different salts have an affect on the growth of brine shrimp (artima salina.) Naturally brine shrimp grow in the ocean in the presence of sodium chloride. This project was to see if sodium chloride is the only salt brine shrimp can live in healthily. <br><br> One distilled water and five different salt environments were created in which to hatch and grow brine shrimp. The five salts used were: Sodium Chloride 5.99g, Calcium Chloride 15.1g, Lithium Chloride 4.35g, Sodium Iodide 15.38g, and Sodium Phosphate 27.5g. Each of these salts was added to cups containing 3 liters of distilled water. The pH was tested and had to be 7 or 8 and then a teaspoon of eggs was added to each cup and 1/4 teaspoon of yeast for food. Then the cups were covered and placed in a shoe box. Each day 100 micro liter samples were taken from each solution and placed into Petri dishes via micro-pipette. The hatched brine shrimp were counted from each sample and the number was recorded.<br><br> After two trials of 9 days each, it was found that the sodium phosphate supported the most life. On the last day of the experiment the Sodium Phosphate had an average of 115 brine shrimp hatched and the Sodium Chloride only had 20. The Calcium Chloride had 50 hatched, Lithium Chloride had 20, and the Sodium Iodide had 10. The brine shrimp in the distilled water died on day 4 of each trial. <br><br> The conclusion is that brine shrimp need to live only in the presence of either sodium or chloride, not both. The Sodium Phosphate was the most effective in supporting brine shrimp life. I believe this is due to the higher amounts of phosphate present in the environment which makes for more ideal conditions in which DNA can replicate to increase the number of brine shrimp hatched.

THE EFFECT OF PYRETHROID PESTICIDE ON THE APHIS GLYCINES PREDATOR- HARMONIA AXYRIDIS
Michael Francis Fosdick
Mediapolis High School, Mediapolis, Iowa, USA

The bioassay was conducted to analyze the toxic affect of Mustang MAX, a pyrethroid pesticide, on the Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis), the aphid’s (Aphis glycines) natural predator. Mustang MAX was sprayed on soybean (Glycine max) leaves to evaluate the impact of chemical residue on the Asian lady beetle. Another treatment where Harmonia axyridis were in direct contact with the spray was conducted to determine any mortality differences. Mortality rates were similar in both cases, however residual contact supported life for a longer period of time. This bioassay indicated the methods evaluated negatively impact the Asian lady beetle. <br><br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF LOW-CALORIE SWEETENER ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Jessica Lynne Witt
Central Virginia Governor's School/Jefferson Forest High School, Forest, VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how different doses of sucrose and sucralose affect the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. The study was conducted at a local high school in central Virginia during the fall and winter months of 2003 and 2004. Three types of Drosophila, 2 wild, ORE-R and Canton-S, and 1 mutant, per0, were tested with two different doses of sucrose and sucralose. Ten flies of each type were tested with sweeteners. The flies were anesthetized and decapitated and then tested with the sweetener. For the smaller dose the flies were decapitated and immediately had the sweetener micropipetted onto their nerve chord and their behavioral reaction recorded on a scale of 0-7 from a previous drosophila study (McClung and Hirsh, 1998). For the larger dose the flies were placed in vials with the sweetener mixed in the food so they would be exposed to it over time. After a week these were tested and their behavior was recorded in the same way as the other flies. After all data was collected statistical tests were run. An ANOVA showed there was a significant difference in the sweetener results with a p-value of 0.016. A Tukey test showed there was no significant difference between any group and the control. But there was a significant difference between the weekly sucralose and daily sucrose dosage groups and the weekly sucralose and weekly sucrose dosage groups. This indicated that neither dosage of the sweeteners had a significant effect on the nervous system of the Drosophila melanogaster tested. Further analysis is suggested since the sample size was small and there was an interaction between sweeteners and behavior.

CLADOGRAM CONSTRUCTION OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES BASED ON MUSCLE PROTEIN PLOYMORPHISMS
Steven Mark van Dijk
Pleasant Grove High School, Pleasant Grove, Utah, United States of America

My research led me to a number of cladograms, or evolutionary trees dealing with aquatic invertebrates. Most of these evolutionary trees are constructed using all sorts of characteristics - appearance, fossil records, DNA, etc. I decided that I wanted to construct my own cladogram using only one characteristic: muscle protein polymorphisms. <br><br> I collected tissue samples from eight different types of aquatic invertebrates. By boiling the muscle proteins from each organism with a chemical called SDS, I caused the proteins to denature and the SDS to bind to the amino acids giving them a negative charge. After straightening each organism’s proteins, I deposited them into a polyacrylamide gel. <br><br> Running an electrophoresis allowed me to separate and individually isolate proteins from the mixtures. Staining the proteins helped me calculate migration distances and measure relative concentrations for each protein. A kaleidoscope of seven known proteins sizes was used for the control. Using the information from the Kaleidoscope, I calculated the size of all the other proteins from all the other organisms. <br><br> Analyzing my data, I calculated the similarities between each organism and constructed my own cladogram with the assumption that organisms with similar proteins were closely related. The cladogram I constructed was comparable to standard cladograms with some striking differences. For example, in literature the squid and the octopus are usually considered to be closely related, however, my results indicated that they were not closely related.<br><br>

Ileana de Gracia, Vega Alta PR; United Satates

The test subject of this investigation is the organism “Danaus plexippus", which is commonly known as the Monarch Butterfly. This investigation has brief information of the plant from which this organism was collected and information of various stages of the development of this butterfly.<br><br> The goal of this investigation was to determine how constant illumination or lack of it affected the development of the test subjects (Danaus plexippus). Three acrylic boxes where used and each one was assigned a number. Fifteen caterpillars of Danaus plexippus were collected and were divided into three groups of five individuals each. Group number one was exposed to constant illumination, which was provided by an ordinary 25watt light bulb. Group number two was exposed to constant darkness or lack of illumination. Group number three was the control group, and it went through the normal cycle of illumination and darkness of a normal 24-hour day.<br><br> The results demonstrated that the caterpillars exposed to constant illumination (box 1) became bigger butterflies than those in boxes number 2 and number 3. The butterflies from box 1 were also more active and could fly better than the ones in box 2. Another important point was that the stage from chrysalis to butterfly in box 1 was almost the same as in box 3. Therefore the life cycle of monarch butterfly can be duplicated under artificial conditions of light without adverse affects on the butterfly. This is an important fact because this butterfly is an endangered specie. <br><br>

OH WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE: THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE WEB SPINNING ABILITIES OF ORB WEAVER SPIDERS
Victor Edward Cross
Central High School, 2400 Dobbs Drive, Phenix City, AL 36867

Spider webs are noted for their symmetry and precision. There has been research on the effect of various drugs (such as LSD and marijuana) on the web spinning abilities of spiders, but there have been no reported studies with alcohol. During the summer and fall of 2003, 40% ETOH in the form of vodka, was applied to orb weaver spider webs in order to determine the effect of vodka on web construction. Taxonomic determinations were completed with the assistance of a professional arachnologist. The hypothesis that was advanced was that vodka would have no effect on the number of rays, number of cells, length of cells, width of cells, and total area of cells; or that there would be fewer before consumption of alcohol. The alternate hypothesis was that vodka would increase that data. Thirty-nine webs were tested. The Ho was rejected for number of rays and number of cells at the 0.01 confidence level. The number of rays and cells decreased signficantly after the consumption of alcohol. The Ho was accepted for the area of cells, the average size of the cell increased significantly (0.01 confidence level) after consumption of alcohol by orb weaver spiders.

ANTENNULES USE AND FLICKING RATE VARIATIONS OF THE NORTHERN CRAYFISH (ORCONECTES VIRILIS) WHEN EXPOSED TO ALARM AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS
Felix J. Jorge-Garcia

Antennal flicking is a behavior essential for crayfish and it has been proposed that it may have evolved as the response to turbulent and chaotic odors. This investigation pretends to determine the possible alteration in antennal flicking when exposed to different chemical odors.<br><br> The Northern Crayfish (Orconectes virilis) was studied for its critical condition. Studies have suggested that the introduced Rusty Crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) is taking over the habitat of the native specie and possibly hydridizing.<br><br> The Northern Crayfish antennal flicking was tested when exposed to different chemical signals: food signals (fish cocktail), agonistic signals (dead conspecific) and alarm signals (O. rusticus urine). There was also a control group in which no odor was added to the system.<br><br> Flicking rate increased in all cases (odor treatments), but almost always higher in males. In general terms it can be established that there is an apparent significant sensitivity of O. virilis to O. rusticus physio-chemical signals. Although male O. virilis continued to be alert (increased flicking rate) for an extended period of time, females of the same specie appeared to relax (normal flicking rate) after recognizing the signal.<br><br> These results suggest that O. virilis females might be evolutively selecting O. rusticus males for breeding.

ANCIENT OCEANIC MICROSCOPIC FOSSILS
Andrew Allen Gilbert
Rocky Mountain Junior High School, West Haven, UT, U.S.A

The purpose of this project is to find out where most of the beach fossils from the Paleozoic and Cenozoic Eras are now.<br><br> The project’s hypotheses is that more microscopic beach fossils will be found in sand from the eastern side of Asia than other locations in the comparison.<br><br> In the past, all of the continents were connected. This was called Pangea. During Pangea, the largest amount of land that was exposed the warm water ocean is what is now Asia’s eastern coast. This fact led to the formulation of the hypothesis.<br><br> Samples were requested from sources around the world. When samples arrived, a paintbrush was statically charged and dipped into the sand. The sand was spread on a slide. When a fossil was found under the microscope, it was compared to the references by shape, color, markings and size. It was then classified and filed in corresponding containers by location.<br><br> The major references were North American Fossils and fossils: An In-Depth Look. Sources for sand were from contacts through the Internet.<br><br> The Conclusion was that the project did not support the Hypothesis. More fossils were found on the eastern coast of North America than the eastern side of Asia.<br><br> Further research will be done with taking into consideration ocean currents, tides and deposits in the ocean from river flows.

INVESTIGATING QUALITATIVE INDICATORS OF RELATIVE METABOLIC RATE IN PHIDIPPUS SP. PHASE II: ESTABLISHING VALIDITY USING QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY
Erin Louise Moulding
Fremont High School, 1900 North 4700 West, Plain City, Ut, 84404

Metabolic rate is an important variable when studying the physiology of spiders. The standard method for determining metabolic rate is lab-based respirometry-- measuring CO2 production and O2 consumption. It was hypothesized that waste production, a variable previously found to be correlated to temperature of living chambers for spiders, would be significantly correlated to CO2 production, the standard measure of metabolism. This study sought to validate waste production as a viable qualitative measure for determining relative metabolic rate through correlation to CO2 production. Metabolic rate was induced, with living chamber temperatures of 20oC and 10oC, for a sample of 28 Phidippus sp. spiders, with both qualitative and quantitative data collected. Qualitative data included (a) waste production, (b) rate of prey consumption, and (c) nesting characteristics. Quantitative data were CO2 production and O2 consumption. The CO2 production of the spiders in the sample was measured in milliliters per gram per hour. Four cycles, of seven spiders per cycle, were measured in the respirometry equipment, with the spiders kept at their respective temperatures of 20oC and 10oC. Indeed, group membership (temperature), was significantly correlated to CO2 production and waste excretion r=0.777, p<.01 and r=0.788, p<.01, respectively. It was found that the amount of CO2 produced was significantly correlated to the number of waste excretions(r=0.631, p<0.01), supporting the hypothesis that waste production could be used in the field as a viable indicator of metabolism.

A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CONTROLLING TERMITES
Valerie Rose Hernandez
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, American Samoa

Although termites are beneficial in decomposing much of the earth's biomass, they are very costly in terms of the damage they cause. Many homes, buildings, furniture, and other wood-made things are destroyed year after year from termite infestations. A colony of termites was collected and identified as Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae: Coptotermes sp. It was maintained in the school's science lab within plastic containers and used for an experiment using an antibiotic (Amoxicillin) to see whether the bacteria within the termite gut that digests the cellulose present in the wood would be affected and if this could be a possible control method. Coffee filter paper that was to be used in the experiment was slightly dampened with purified water and introduced to the termites to ensure that no toxic chemicals existed within the paper that would prove to be fatal to the termites. This was to also give some moisture in order for the termites' survival. When the coffee filter paper proved to have no fatal effects, the experiment began. Aqueous dilutions of antibiotics were prepared and tested against the termites by using Amoxicillin-impregnated coffee filter paper. The results show that no mortality was recorded up to 40 hours after the feeding of the Amoxicillin-impregnated coffee filter paper. The highest mortality (68%) recorded was in the concentration of 200% while the lowest mortality (0%) recorded was in the 10% concentration. The mortality data was also analyzed by using the POLO-PC Probit and Logit Analysis Software.

UTILIZATION OF SPINES VS OTOLITHS TO AGE ARCHOSARGUS PROBATOCEPHALUS, PHASE III
Christopher Jason Atkins
Brunswick High School, Brunswick, Ga, United States of America

This experiment sought to determine the effectiveness of using anal spines to age Archosargus probatocephalus as compared to the accepted method of sectioned otoliths. 66 fish were collected and the left and right otoliths and anal spine removed. Samples were limited to fish 3 years and under. One otolith was sectioned, the other was weighed, measured, burned, and treated with cedar oil. The spine was sectioned. The spines and otoliths were examined under a microscope and photographed. Data set included sectioned age estimates and variables of whole otolith values, spine values, weight,andlength. Results showed the researcher accurately aged the whole otoliths in 65 of 66 samples and the anal spines in 60 of 66 samples. An ANOVA was conducted to determine the significance level between spines, whole otoliths, weight, and length of whole otoliths to sectioned otoliths. The burned whole otolith compared to the sectioned otoliths showed a strong statistical significance at 2.64521 E-50. Spines compared to the sectioned otoliths showed a strong statistical significance at 1.55394 E-19. Weight compared to sectioned otoliths showed a strong statistical significance at 0.014053078. Length compared to sectioned otoliths showed no statistical significance at 0.088745238. Results showed the length of the whole otoliths was not a reliable method of aging but the weight of whole otoliths could be used to reliably age the fish in conjunction with another method such as whole or sectioned otoliths. Results showed whole otoliths could be used. Spines could also be used as a reliable method.

A COMPARISON OF HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX MODELS FOR BARRED OWLS (STRIX VARIA) IN LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA, USA.
Alexander W. Seebeck
Loudoun Valley High School, Purcellville, VA, USA 20132

The purpose of this experiment was to test existing Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) models for Barred Owls (Strix varia) in Loudoun County Virginia. HSI models are formulas that use habitat characteristics to determine how well an area can sustain an organism. Researchers include different variables in the models to indicate important life requirements, combining them in different mathematical ways. Calculations generally result in a 1 for the best possible, and a 0 for least-favorable habitats. <br><br> Four square blocks, 100 hectares each, were chosen to test the HSI formulas. A one hectare plot was located around a possible nest tree within the block and fifteen environmental characteristics, like forest crown closure and mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of the trees, and distances to water, open space and human disturbance were measured. A total of 24 formulas were used to calculate HSI results for the four territories. <br><br> Incredibly, at sites with breeding pairs of Barred Owls present, one-third of the formulas produced zeros, indicating unsuitable habitat. One possible reason for the results may be that the models were designed for other locations, based on the assumed habitat requirements there. For example, Barred Owls are always defined as interior forest birds that need large unbroken tracts of mature forest with conifers for cover. However, Barred Owl populations in Loudoun County have been observed to occur in very small patches, with few evergreen trees. More study and better HSI models will be needed to explain the success of Barred Owls in Loudoun County. <br><br><br><br> <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE SENSORY PERCEPTION SKILLS OF THE DERMACENTOR VARIABILIS, AMBLYOMMA AMERICANUM, AND RHIPECEPHALUS SANGUINEUS TICK SPECIES
Chelsea Nicole Grigery
Sikeston High School, Sikeston, Missouri, USA

This research tested the sensory perception skills of three species of ticks to determine if various stimuli were attractants.<br><br> The stimuli included colors (red, blue, black, and green); carbon dioxide; deer urine; 20 Mule Team Borax; washed red blood cells; domestic dog blood; baking soda; beta alanine; cholesterol; lactic acid; peptone; phenylalanine; urea; hot and cold temperatures; and motion. The ticks were dropped in the center of an experimental tube with the stimulus and the control (water) on separate ends. Results were recorded after twenty-four hours.<br><br> Positive results were attained using the cumulative response ratio of all three species in the following trials: beta alanine (77%); urea (77%); red blood cells (73%); peptone (67%); dog blood (63%); phenylalanine (53%); and baking soda (50%). A negative response was recorded in the remaining eleven trials. The hypothesis was supported with the cumulative data in 53% of the experiment.<br><br> The research concluded that the control was a greater attractant than the stimulus in 58% of the trials. An unexpected discovery, however, was that the behavior of the ticks varied significantly by species. The Rhipecephalus sanguineus results were virtually opposite those of the other two species in seven of the experiments, indicating that each species may seek a different stimulus to identify its host. The experiments also revealed that beta alanine and urea were greater attractants than the ticks’ blood food source. <br><br>

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF A COMMON CORN CRIMINAL; THE INFLUENCE OF HETERORHABDITIS NEMATODES ON THE C. DIMIDIATUS, NITIDULIDAE CORN SAP BEETLE.
DJ Ray Horton
Hotchkiss high school, Hotchkiss, Colorado, United States

Sweet corn is a major economic product throughout the United States. The corn sap beetle, which affects immature corn, is an increasing problem throughout western Colorado and the United States. Adult sap beetles are currently controlled using chemical insecticides. <br><br>This experiment was designed to examine the effect of a biological control on the eradication of the C. dimidiatus, Nitidulidae sap beetle via laboratory reared Heterorhabditis nematodes. <br><br>The eradication of sap beetles was a multi-step procedure. Galleria mellonella wax moth larvae were reared as a food source for the Heterorhabditis Nematodes. Additionally C. dimidiatus, Nitidulidae sap beetles were reared. Heterorhabditis nematodes were introduced into the sap beetle habitat. Three sap beetle larva were placed in each Petri dish. Two counts of the number of alive and dead sap beetle larva in each Petri dish were taken, one after five days, the second after seven days. Beetles were dissected to ensure that infestation had occurred.<br><br>After five days, 80% of the control group were alive and 20% were dead, group one 75% alive and 25% dead, group two 58% alive and 42% dead, group three 33% alive and 67% dead. After 7 days 80% of the control group were alive and 20% were dead, group one 25% alive and 75% dead, group two 16% alive and 84% dead, group three .08% alive and 99.92% dead. <br><br> Sweet corn growers may use this information to help control the spread of the sap beetle in their fields, using a biological control rather than chemical insecticides. <br><br>

HABITAT PREFERENCE AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF ROAD MORTALITY SNAKES IN THE KILLDEER PLAINS WILDLIFE AREA, WYANDOT COUNTY, OH
Nathan Jacobs Yaussy
Buckeye Valley High, Delaware, OH, USA

Serious concerns exist regarding declines in numbers of eastern plains garter snakes (Thamnophis radix radix) and eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sisturus catenatus catenatus), which are listed as endangered on Ohio’s threatened and endangered species list and found in Killdeer Plains Wildlife Area (KPWA) in Wyandot County, Ohio, USA. Observations during fieldwork at KPWA have indicated that virtually all species of snakes native to the area are frequently killed by vehicular traffic. A method for determining habitat preferences was explored. All roads in the KPWA were driven twice weekly during the fall migration period, September to November 2003. Snakes were identified, location recorded by Global Positioning System (GPS), and length recorded by digital photograph. After three years of decreasing numbers, a greater number of snakes in this season show that four road surveys are not enough to determine population trends. The percentage of live snakes did not increase as the total number of snakes did. The largest age group of snakes was preadults. Linear analysis of habitat was not able to discriminate among species by habitat preference when all species were included in analysis. The removal of species with wider habitat range allowed for a more accurate analysis of the habitats for other snakes.

A WILD HAIR PART II THE EFFECTS OF HAIR ON CUTANEOUS WOUND REPAIR
Laci Sharee Lawrence
Andrews High School, Andrews, Texas, USA

“A Wild Hair Part II” is a second year study on the effects keratin, a protein in human hair, has on the healing process. 40 Wistar rats were purchased and housed in cages divided with wire. The rats were divided into groups of 10 and had an incision made on their tail with a Surgicutt Junior by a veterinarian. I applied a band-aid with hair, hair/Neo, Neosporin, or nothing on the wound. The band-aid was changed and after 5 days, the vet took a biopsy sample. Histology procedures were used to cut and stain samples with hematoxylin and eosin. The area of keratin, the scab, and dermal and surface collagen was calculated using a microscope. A retest was performed with six rats from each group. The averages from both tests confirmed a 24% increase in keratin from the control to the Hair/Neo group. Both the Hair and Neo had over 37% increases. In the scab area, a 36% increase existed between the hair and control, and a 30% increase for the Neo. Collagen dots showed a 42% increase for Hair and a 51% increase for Neo. Dermal collagen had a 25% increase for both the Hair and Neo. These averages show that hair worked just below the level of Neosporin. Results show that in poor countries or in survival situations, human hair offers a beneficial treatment for wound healing.

A STUDY ON ANTENNA RECEPTORS AND THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE ANTENNA OF CNEORANE VIOLACEIPENNIS ALLARD
Chen Yang
No.2 Secondary School Attached to ECNU, Shanghai 201203, China

Purpose: Lespedeza is considered as a very useful kind of plant in tackling desertification nowadays. Meanwhile, they are also the host plants for Cneorane violaceipennis, which negatively affects the plants' proper growth. For insects, antennae are vital in their communicating with the outside world. This project aims at giving an overall morphological description of the antenna of this harmful insect and establishing a model for its antenna.<br><br>Procedure: The observations were made mainly utilizing scanning electron microscope and light microscope. 9 kinds of receptors were discovered on the antenna and the amount and distribution of each receptor were recorded under SEM. Meanwhile, a new method on dissecting the antenna was designed and used which enabled the observation on the inner 3D structure of the antenna. Besides, tissue section was adopted in order to study the transects of different segments of the antenna under light microscope.<br><br>Conclusions: Different sensilla should have their own detecting range. The functions of the sensilla were preliminarily discussed based on their appearance and distribution. According to the discoveries of the inner structure of the antenna, a model of the antenna of this insect was established. Further, based on the discovery of the distribution of the muscle inside the antenna, a new opinion on the denomination of each segment of the antenna was mentioned and meanwhile,the mechanism of the movement control of the antenna was re-presumed. <br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF IRRADIATED FRUIT ON SUBSEQUENT GEMERATIONS OF DROSOPHILAE
Patrick Lee Burns
Texico High School, Texico, New Mexico, United States of America

My project this year is "The Effect of Irradiated Fruit on Subsequent Generations of Drosophilae." I came up with the idea of my project after my Biology teacher told my class about a letter he recieved from the school cafeteria saying that the fruit they gave to our school was irradiated and by law they had to let us know. I couldn't help but wonder if the radiation in the fruit had any effect on the consumer. I tested this problem using pure genetic Drosophilae, or fruit flies, which I ordered from Frey Scientific. My hypothesis was that the irradiated fruit would have little effect on the Drosophilae. I tested this by feeding equal amounts of irradiated fruit to two different colonies of Drosophilae and I fed two colonies equal amounts of non-irradiated fruit. I examined carefully six generations of Drosophilae from each colony by annesthetizing the generation and viewing each individual fly under a microscope. What I saw was quite amazing because in the colonies feeding on irradiated fruit I found a growth in numbers of mutated flies, either having bent and crumbled wings or they were albino, from each generation. In the colonies feeding on non-irradiated fruit I found absolutely no mutations. By the sixth generations of both colonies of Drosophilae feeding on irradiated fruit, they were 100% genetically mutated. I proved my hypothesis to be incorrect and came up with the conclusion that the radiation in fruit definitely has an affect on Drosophilae.

THE UTILIZATION OF RARE SNPS WITHIN THE CANINE GENOME AS A MEANS OF BREED IDENTIFICATION
Marla Naomi Diakow
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington, New York, USA

Despite major advances in mapping the canine genome, there still exists no concrete way to identify breeds genetically. This study explores the efficiency of rare SNPs (rare allele frequency less than 10% across a panel of ten diverse breeds) in distinguishing between ten canine breeds. Dogs were genotyped at SNP sites in a panel of fifty-eight dogs from the ten breeds. The frequency of the rare alleles was determined to be greatest in only one or two breeds, and not present in the samples of the other breeds. A blinded test of four dogs resulted in the accurate identification of two of the dogs. While it is early to generalize, the study did result in a proof of the concept that breed specific SNPs should be effective for identification by molecular analysis. With potential to automate the process, SNPs offer a more attractive method for breed identification than ever before. <br><br>

FLIGHT PHENOLOGY AND RESPONSES OF IPS PINI TO ENANTIOMERIC BLENDS OF THE AGGREGATION PHEROMONE IPSDIENOL
Heather Anne Charton
Tuscarawas Valley High School, Bolivar, OH, 44612

This project was performed to study Ips pini pheromone<br><br>specificity, flight phenology, and rainfall.<br><br> Twelve lindgren-funnel traps were installed in a pine forest in Sommerdale, Ohio. Six were placed in a stand of red pine and six in a stand of white pine. A blend of ipsdienol [97%(+)/3%(-), 75%(+)/25%(-), 50%(+)/50%(-), 25%(+)/75%(-), or 3%(+)/97%(-)] and a lanierone were attached to each trap. The sixth trap was left as a control. The lures were randomly switched once a week and replaced every four weeks. In the collection cup at the bottom of each trap, a strip of Vapor Tape was placed. Insects were collected from the traps once a week. Ips pini and predators were counted, recorded. and placed in vials containing ethyl alcohol. The degree day was recorded weekly, and the rainfall was recorded monthly. This procedure continued for twenty-nine weeks.<br><br> Insect populations displayed peaks in activity on 4/06, 5/11, 6/15, 7/13, 8/17, and 9/14. Rainfalls recorded this year were greater than last year's rainfalls. The bark beetle populations showed a great decline in number from last year to this year. The majority of the Ips pini were collected in traps containing lures of the 50%(+)/50%(-) and 75%(+)/25%(-) blends.<br><br> This project displayed interesting results. A new generation of bark beetles emerges every four to six weeks in Ohio. Combining the increase of rainfall and decrease of Ips pini populations, it is deduced that amounts of rainfall and bark beetle populations are inversely related. Ips pini prefer the 50%(+)/50%(-) blend of ipsdienol.

USE OF MICROSATELLITE DNA TO ASCERTAIN THE ORIGIN OF RAINBOW TROUT (ONCORHYNCUS MYKISS) FOUND IN AN ANOMALOUS LOCATION
Conor Louis Jacobs
Sentinel High School, Missoula, Montana, USA

<br><br> The aim of this project is to determine the origin of nine rainbow trout that were found by Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks personnel in an upstream section of Mill Creek, which is a tributary of the Yellowstone River. There is a barrier that should have blocked the trout from moving into this section, and furthermore, no rainbows have ever been stocked in this location. It is possible that rainbow trout from downstream Mill Creek somehow moved into the upper section without outside interference. It is also possible that fish were illegally introduced from an outside source into the upstream section.<br><br> <br><br> MFWP personnel took nine fin clip samples from rainbow trout found in the upstream section and thirty fin clip samples from a rainbow trout population living in Mill Creek below the barrier. In order to compare the genetic structures of upstream and downstream trout, both the upstream sample and downstream population were analyzed at five microsatellite loci: SSA311, BT60, SF08, FGT3, and SSA408.<br><br> <br><br> DNA was extracted from all individuals in both the upstream sample and downstream population. Analysis at the loci consisted of first performing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on samples for each locus. Electrophoresis of amplified PCR products was then carried out on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.<br><br>Statistical analysis of the data shows that the upstream sample and downstream population have sufficiently different genetic makeup that one may assume they are unrelated, and thus, that the trout found above the barrier were introduced there illegally by humans.<br><br> <br><br>

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION AND INTERLEUKIN 8 RECEPTOR GENOTYPE IN DAIRY COWS
Kari Michelle Jones
Clarkrange High School, Clarkrange, TN, USA

Mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland, is a disease costing the dairy industry over two billion dollars annually. It affects not only the quantity of milk produced, but also the quality of the milk. A possible step in the resolution of mastitis could be the ability to identify the genotypes in cattle that are more susceptible to the disease. It appears that cattle of differing genotypes do indeed vary in their susceptibility to mastitis. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the killing ability of neutrophils from cows of different genotypes through a reactive oxygen species generation assay. This was done to determine the migration and intensity of neutrophil function from the different genotypes. Once the migration and intensity were measured, the relationship between the function of the neutrophils and the Interleukin 8 receptor genotypes could be determined. There appears to be changes in the SNP+777 of the CRCX2 gene. In this research, the cows with the genotype CG proved to be more susceptible than the GG Genotype cattle as indicated by the Interleukin 8 receptor GG genotypes reacting not only to lower levels of stimulation, but also reacting with greater intensity. This combination suggests a stronger immune response by these cows. Further research to determine why this difference is significant appears justified and suggested in order to be able to treat these animals more efficiently.<br><br>

BIODIVERSITY OF STRONGYLE SPECIES IN EQUIDS: CONSTANT IVERMECTIN VS. ABSENCE OF DEWORMING REGIMEN
Leann Little
Clarkrange High School, Clarkange, TN, USA

The objective of this experiment was to compare the biodiversity of strongyle species of equids on a regulated deworming schedule using ivermectin(with the exception of the past seven months to allow for reinfestation) versus those with no deworming history. The strongyle species to be observed were Strongylus vulgaris, Strongylus edentatus, Strongylus equinus, and small strongyles(cyathosomes).<br><br> To perform this investigation, fecal samples were taken from fourteen different horses. Seven of these horses had been on a regulated deworming schedule and the other seven had no deworming history. The strongyles were retrieved from the samples using laboratory coproculture techniques and were then viewed under a microscope at 40X magnification. Strongyles were classified according to size, pattern, and number of intestinal cells.<br><br> After all calculations were completed, the group of equids that were on a regulated deworming schedule using ivermectin had the following total of each parasite: Strongylus vulgaris-0; Strongylus edentatus-10; Strongylus equinus-0; small strongyles-380. The seven horses that had no deworming history prior to experimentation had the following total of each strongyle species: Strongylus vulgaris-120; Strongylus edentatus-340; Strongylus equinus-0; small strongyles-730. This data indicates that the populations of Strongylus vulgaris and Strongylus edentatus were, in fact, significantly larger in equids with no deworming history. However, the same data also proves that the level of small strongyles were much lower in horses who had been on on a regulated deworming program with ivermectin. No members of the Strongylus equinus species were present in either population of horses involved in this study.<br><br>

THE ANALYSIS OF NATURAL PRODUCTS ON THE GROWTH RATE OF TURKEYS
Matthew David Muehler
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, North Dakota, USA

PURPOSE: To determine if the usage of natural products, as additives in feed or in water, could affect the growth rate of Meleagris gallopavo. Also, to observe the effects of the products on the nutrient content of turkey manure.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Randomly selected 100 tom turkeys from a 10,000 bird flock and separated them into four 25 bird groups (Control Feed, Lactobacillus, Yucca, and Relief Premix).<br><br>BI-MONTHLY WEIGHT - Monitored the weight gain of each bird, once every two weeks, during a ten-week testing period. At the end of the testing period, completed a feed conversion to feasibly evaluate the study.<br><br>BACTERIA COLONIZATION - Weekly monitored the number of Escherichia coli colonies found in the feces of each group. <br><br>PLANT STUDY - Compared five various seeds for root and shoot growth, and germination percentage of plants, while using turkey manure as a natural fertilizer.<br><br>SOIL TESTING - Analyzed soil samples, saturated with turkey manure, for their soil nutrient levels.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Overall, the Lactobacillus group had the best feed conversion, gained the most amount of weight, and performed greatest in the Plant Study. In the Bacteria Colonization test, the Yucca group had the lowest average number of Escherichia coli colonies present. In the Soil Testing, all of the natural products added more nutrients to the soil, when compared to the Control. Overall, I feel that feces from the supplement groups have the capabilities to act as natural fertilizers and that natural feed supplements exhibit the potential to be used as growth enhancers.

CORAL PROPAGATION THE EFFECTS OF FOOD SUPPLEMENTS ON THE ACTINODISCUS MUSHROOM ANEMONE
Lindsay Marine Quandt
Algonac High School, Algonac Michigan, United States

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of various food additives on the growth of Actinodiscus Striatus mushroom anemone. I chose this particular species because they have a moderate care level, which allows them to adapt to change without causing any damage. They have a sessile lifestyle and are classified as Anthozoans. These corals display a variety of colors, textures and patterns.<br><br> For this experiment, I tested twenty green-striped mushrooms. I grew five mushrooms in each of the four tanks. The recommended tank conditions I followed were 75°F water temperature, twelve hours of light and dark, and constant water movement. The food additives I used were brine shrimp, ZooPlex, and PhytoPlex. My control didn’t receive any food. To determine the change in growth, I measured the weight of the individual mushrooms once a week. This was done using an electronic balance to achieve exact results. I recorded the weights in a table. <br><br> The mushrooms were measured for twelve weeks. During this time period, physical size changes were evident. The mushrooms given brine shrimp had the largest increase in growth with an average increase of .31 grams. The mushrooms given the liquid additive also increased in weight, but not as much. The ZooPlex caused an average increase of .16 grams and the PhytoPlex caused an average increase of .19 grams. The tank that wasn’t given any food lost an average of .11 grams. From these results I have concluded that brine shrimp will increase the growth of mushrooms the most.<br><br>

POPULATION ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL OF THE NEW GUINEA SUGARCANE WEEVIL ON GUAM
Neeraj Nagarajan
John F. Kennedy High School, Tamuning, Guam

The Rhabdoscelus obscurus was accidentally introduced into Guam from Hawaii in 1943 and since then the invasive insect has sustained it’s population and has thrived on the abundance of ornamental palms on Guam. The insect’s larvae feed of the trunks of palms causing the trunks to become brittle, hollow, and susceptible to damage by cyclonic winds. The weevil-infested trees literally snap during the typhoons that regularly strike Guam. The primary objectives of this project were to find an organic and inexpensive way to control the spread of the weevil and to assess the population of the invasive insect on Guam.<br><br> The Capture-Recapture Technique was utilized in the census, through the setting up of pheromone and food-volatile baited traps in different locations across the island. <br><br> Concentrations (1cc/100ml, 2cc/100ml) of NeemazalEC were used, on sugarcane stalks that were inoculated with weevil larvae. The stalks were opened and changed triweekly and measurements of the larvae/pupae we recorded.<br><br> I received considerably higher captures/recaptures in areas that were densely populated with ornamental palms. The capture-recapture formula provided a census of 11,469 weevils.<br><br> Both concentrations average widths and weights were significantly greater than that of the control group and the mortality rate in the concentrations (1cc/100ml=60%, 2cc/100ml=80%) was significantly higher as opposed to the 0% mortality rate in the control.<br><br> The contributions of this project are two-fold. First, we now have an idea of the population of the weevil on Guam. Secondly, this project also provides an organic and an inexpensive alternative for controlling the weevil.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF APPETITE SUPPRESSANTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF DROSOPHILA
Joshua Harold Wheeler
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, Ms, United States of America

ABSTRACT<br><br> The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of varying doses of appetite suppressants on the nervous system of Drosophila. If two doses of Phentermine and Metabolife are micropipetted into the nervous systems of decapitated wild-type Drosophilia and per Drosophila and their resulting behavioral characteristics rated on a scale of 0-7, then the larger dose of Phentermine would result in the highest rating on the scale for both types of flies. <br><br> Each type of Drosophila was anesthetized and placed into cultural vials with medium. There was 1 control group and four experimental groups. In the control group, no drugs were tested. In the experimental groups, each fly type was tested with one or two doses of either Phentermine or Metabolife. Dose one was proportional to the average amount taken by a human female daily. Dose two was proportional to the average dose taken by a human female over one hundred days. Experimental groups were anesthetized to remove the heads using razors and allowed thirty minutes of recovery time. The flies were viewed under a microscope and the specific dose of the assigned appetite suppressant was micropipetted into the nervous system of each group. Videotaped results of the behavior of each group were compared with the control group. Behavioral scores were assigned and compared. <br><br> Both appetite suppressants caused a significant effect on the nervous system, but Metabolife (over the counter) caused a greater effect than Phentermine (prescription). This research supports the recent ban of Ephedra products. <br><br>

THE BUZZ ON BEES: THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND NICOTINE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF BIOGENIC AMINES IN THE BRAIN OF THE APIS MELLIFERA
Russell Thomas Burrows
Health Careers High School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of alcohol and nicotine on the biogenic amines dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine in the honey bee brain. It was hypothesized that the consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and a combination of both would change the distribution of biogenic amines in the brain of the Apis mellifera.<br><br> The experimental design consisted of three treatments administered to restrained honey bees; 10 microliters of 10% ethanol/sucrose solution, 1 microliter of nicotine, a combination of .5 microliters of ethanol and 1 microliter of nicotine, and the control, where no treatment was used. Honey bee brains were dissected out of the bee, processed, embedded, sectioned and stained using immunocytochemical techniques. The intensities of antibody stains around biogenic amine sites were rated as compared to a negative control using light microscopy. <br><br> Results supported the hypothesis indicating that nicotine and alcohol treatments affected biogenic amine activity. Alcohol, nicotine and combined treatments, increased dopamine and serotonin levels. Octopamine levels were depleted by alcohol, but stimulated by nicotine, mimicking human reactions to nicotine, which increases adrenaline levels. Statistical analysis supports the significance of the results. <br><br> Three prior studies in this model tested honey bee response to alcohol inhibitors and inducers in consumption and associative learning experiments. Combined results of all four studies indicate that honey bees would be ideal assays, corresponding to human alcohol and nicotine reactions both behaviorally and neurologically. Thus, honey bees could make viable, inexpensive, "rapid screening" subjects in first line trials prior to vertebrate testing. Such findings could prove invaluable to health organizations devoted to developing treatments for drug and alcohol abuse. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF MELATONIN ON DISRUPTED CIRCADIAN CYCLES IN HYDRA LITTORALIS
Jamie Sarbo Wagner
Northwood High School, Pittsboro, North Carolina, USA

This project investigated melatonin’s effectiveness in reducing the disruptive effects of changed circadian cycles in Hydra littoralis. It was hypothesized that the added melatonin could counter the effects of altered circadian cycles, leaving the organism able to function more optimally. <br><br>The combined effect of the disrupted circadian cycles and the addition of melatonin was measured by the hydras' population growth rate by budding. Nine different test conditions were studied, with varying melatonin concentrations and varying amounts of light shifting, defined as shifts in scheduled periods of light and darkness. Two petri dishes containing hydras were placed within each of the testing conditions. In addition to the control group, which received no melatonin, two test groups received melatonin; concentrations consisted of a 1 x 10-6 M (one micromolar) solution and a 3.4 x 10-8 M solution, diluted in water. <br><br>The results of this experiment showed that melatonin did stimulate an increase in the population growth of the hydras in both the disrupted and unchanged light conditions. An unexpected additional result was the indication that hydra are more influenced by the number of hours of darkness than by the timing of light periods.<br><br>Melatonin appears to have benefits in aiding adjustment to shifting light schedules, and it may possess other generalized benefits to hydras. Understanding the direct cause of this positive effect may help explain melatonin’s more complex role in regulating the daily cycles in other organisms. <br><br>

COMPLEX MEMORY & EVOLUTION
Ben Jacob Novak
Alexander Public School, Alexander, ND, USA

Recent studies with the genetics of corals have shown that corals, simple cnidarians with no brain, share roughly five hundred genes with humans and other vetebrates. This shows that vertebrate genes thought to be unique to the phylum had their origins in invertebrates. Ten percent of these genes are not shared with Drosophilia flies and nematode worms. This shows the propensity for gen deletion in advancing evolution. In this experiment, genes for memory were searched for in the platyhelminthes genus Dugesia. The aim of the experriment was to infer the genetic code of black planarians as either containing or lacking genes for memory without genetic sequencing, but rather observation for the expression for the genes through behavioral adherence. Three groups of black planarians were run through two mazes to analyze complex and simple memory. From the data, the experiment has shown that complex and simple memory are not expressed in the species. This implies that the genes for memory are not contained in the genome of the species and through related research has been determined to have been lost in the evolution of the species.

GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROMOTER TARGETING SEQUENCE
Vipul Kumar
Cherry Hill High School East, Cherry Hill NJ, United States

The function of a genomic regulatory sequence, the 625 bp Promoter Targeting Sequence(PTS), in Drosophila melanogaster was examined for its ability to allow enhancers to activate promoters while overcoming chromatin boundary elements called insulators, and maintaining promoter specificity between an enhancer and promoter. To determine the minimal sequence that maintains full PTS function, a minimal 200 bp sequence was analyzed by creating a P-element construct used for germline transformation in yw Drosophila melanogaster embryos. The 200 bp sequence was isolated because sequences (>100bp) upstream and downstream showed full PTS activity. A P-element transposon containing the tp-lacZ and white promoters, suHw insulator, and iab-8 enhancer was microinjected into the embryos to introduce the sequence. Mature generations of yw flies were backcrossed with virgin yw flies. Subsequent generations showing a deviation from the white eye color were assumed to be transgenic, and their embryos were analyzed via in-situ hybridization. Results showed both the lacZ and white promoters were activated, indicating that the 200 bp sequence used retains only partial PTS function, since even though the enhancer was able to activate the promoter region by overcoming the insulator, both promoters were activated. This information can be used to find regions of homology at other gene loci in Drosophila to examine enhancer-promoter interactions. Since Drosophila was used as a genomic model for higher order species, sequences similar to the PTS may be identified in the prominent gene loci of humans to prevent deleterious enhancer-promoter interactions occurring with birth defects and cancer.

A STUDY OF VAGINULUS PLEBEIA WHEN EXPOSED TO PHASEOLUS VULGARIS VARIED BY ALLIUM SATIVUM, ACETIC ACID, AND ROSEMARINUS OFFICINALIS
Carmella Cassandra Scott
Yazoo City High School, Yazoo City, MS, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment is to analyze the effect of Phaseolus vulgaris varied by Allium sativum, acetic acid, and Rosemarinus officinalis on Vaginulus plebeia. Vaginulus plebeia,the most common slug, are damaging pests of fruit trees and vegetables. They feed on plant stems ande trunks, leaves, and flowers, and roots by scaping off the tissue or eating holes in the plant parts. It was hypothesized that Phaseolus vulgaris(pinto beans) varied by Allium sativum, acetic acid, and Rosmarinus officinalis, contains more than 100 biologically useful secondary metabolites. It contains sulfur-containing compounds that are responsible for the flavor, odor, and pharmacological properties. Rosmarinus officinalis(rosemary), has been used by herbalist to improve memory. Recently, rosemary has been used in laboratories and animal studies to investigate its potential antibacterial properties and its potential in preventing cancer. Two biochemical processes, alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation, make acetic acid. It has been used to detect cervical cancer and as a condiment.<br><br> Plants were treated with 10% and 20% solutions of each variable. After reaching maturity, the slugs were exposed to the plants. As a result, each variable repelled the slugs. However, the acetic acid repelled the slugs at a slower rate than the rosemary and garlic. This experiment is beneficial to the agricultural community in that it provides a safe and inexpensive method to repelling slugs. According to scientist, 99.99% of the pesticides used are natural and not necessarily safe for human consumption. All of the variables used in this experiment are beneficial to the human body.

DO SHARKS FAVOR A COLOR?
Kyle William Beighle
Academy for Science and Health, Conroe, Texas, USA

Every year approximately 60 unprovoked shark attacks occur worldwide, and these were mainly determined to be exploratory bites. Vision becomes sharks’ primary hunting sense when they are in 50 feet of clear water, and their ability to distinguish colors at depth is 7 times greater than humans. The purpose of this project was to determine that since sharks’ vision is so sophisticated, do certain colors capture the sharks attention or provoke their curiosity more than others, making divers, swimmers, and surfers who wear these colors to have a higher probability of being attacked? <br><br> Research and experimentation was conducted in a large aquarium facility in quarantined holding tanks, using 1 Carcharhinus brevipinna and 4 Heterodontus francisci as test subjects to study their responses to colors. Experimentation was conducted by placing colored mats on the aquarium floor with equal servings of cut mackerel on each for a total of (25) 5-minute trials. The sharks entered the aquarium one at a time and the number of hits and bumps on each color were measured in order to determine sharks color preferences. The sharks showed a particular interest in the orange and control mats (27% and 22%) while sharks showed the least interest in black and red (4% and 7%) mats. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.<br><br> A continuation of this project occurs by experimenting with shark species in the open ocean, using larger sample sizes of sharks and different species in order to compare the results to the captive species this summer. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VITAMINS A, E, AND C ON THE HEALTH OF GALLUS DOMESTICUS AND THE NUTRITION OF THE EGGS. YEAR THREE
Laura Jennifer Law
Wildwood HS, Wildwood, Florida, USA

The original idea of this project was to determine whether or not the vitamins A, E, and C would improve the overall health of the Gallus domesticus and the overall nutrition of the egg.<br><br> To begin experimentation, the researcher fed a control group of ten hens 36kg of 15% Lay Pellets over a 30-day period. During the month the researcher observed the hens eating habits, egg production, and egg size. At the end of the testing period, the researcher collected five sample eggs.<br><br> Next the researcher added 650,000 IU of vitamin A, 650,000 IU of vitamin E, and 650 mg of vitamin C to the hens feed. During the month, the researcher again observed the hens eating habits, egg production, and egg size. On the last day of the testing period the researcher collected five sample eggs. Both samples were then sent to Eggland's Best Laboratory to be tested for vitamin A, E, and C content as well as cholesterol levels.<br><br> The resulting observations and data indicated that the hens do tend to enjoy the vitamin enriched feed over their traditional feed. They ate it quicker and seemed livelier after consumption. The egg production however remained the same throughout both testing periods as well as the size of the egg.<br><br> The researcher was also correct in guessing that the nutrition levels in the eggs would be increased. The eggs showed increased amounts of both vitamin E and A, but no C was present in either samples. And for a third year, the cholesterol levels in the eggs were also decreased.

ENGINEERED SOUND WAVES OF VARYING FREQUENCIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN DETERRING SHARKS
Kaitlin Maria Luther, Alana Yurkanin
H.P. Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if engineered sound waves of varying frequencies have the ability to deter sharks, possibly preventing shark attacks in the ocean without harming marine life. Sounds used in this experiment were frequencies 10, 15, 20, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 650, 800 and 1600 Hz recorded in four different sound waves (Sawtooth, Sine, Square and Triangle). The hypothesis states that simple frequencies have the ability to deter sharks. <br><br> After extensive research, the results showed that lower frequencies (particularly those of the Triangle wave form) were highly effective in deterring sharks. The sharks were consistently attracted to higher frequencies at the height of their hearing range. Frequencies ranging from 75-300 hertz caused little reaction (with the exception of the Triangle wave which had significantly lower averages). One explanation for this pattern is that many things sharks fear (boat motors, etc.) emit lower frequency sounds, whereas higher frequencies are often associated with injured marine animals.<br><br> Examination of the results shows that the hypothesis was correct in that sharks were deterred by engineered sound waves of varying frequencies. These results can be utilized through the creation of a devices using sound to repel sharks. By playing the most effective sound (Triangle Wave 20 Hz.) into the ocean using a device on a surfboard, watch, etc., it would be possible to create sound barriers that would deter sharks from beaches, rendering a safer environment without harming the sharks or other species.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF EXOTIC EARTHWORM SPECIES ON FOREST ECOSYSTEMS IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA (SOIL BULK DENSITY AND SOIL NUTRIENT CONTENT)
Kirsti Anna Hakala, Jillian Rita Beaufeaux
Cloquet High School, Cloquet, Minnesota, United States of America

“Concerns have been raised about the widespread loss of native forest plant species and the stability of hardwood forest ecosystems” (Hale, 2004). Evidence of exotic earthworms in these devastated areas may be the cause of forest floor vegetation loss. The earthworms studied were Lumbricus terrestris, Apporrectodea, Lumbricus rubellus, and Dendrobenia. This led to the question: if worm species with similar biomasses are introduced into a hardwood forest, will the bulk density and nutrient content in the soil change due to species type? The hypothesis was if different exotic worm species are added to a simulated forest floor environment, then species type will have an effect on soil bulk density and soil nutrient content. Four species of earthworm were collected at the Tettegouche State Park in northern Minnesota. At the NRRI, sieved soil was baked in specialized ovens. Thirty containers were filled with sand, soil, and leaf understory. Each of the 30 containers also contained a resin bag. Into 25 of the 30 containers worms were introduced, the number of worms added to each set of five containers mimics worm biomass along the leading edge. Containers were incubated for a nine-week period. Soil bulk density, percent change in carbon and nitrogen, and the concentration of nutrients absorbed by resin bags was calculated. In all worm applied soils there was a significant increase in bulk density, nitrate, phosphate and ammonium p<.001. There was no significant difference in total nitrogen and carbon.

DOES LIGHT AFFECT BREEDING IN WILD-TYPE VERSUS WHITE-EYED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER?
Amber Marie Keefer, Lauren Nichole Jones
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro Arkansas, United States

The Drosophila melanogaster is the most commonly used subject in genetic research done in today’s science laboratories. Although normally these flies would have red eyes, there is a recessive genetic mutation found in some strains that produce white-eyed flies. The white-eyed specimens are believed to be blind.<br><br> Due to the popularity of these specimens it is essential that they reproduce efficiently so that projects are successful in attaining results. The purpose of this project was to determine under which conditions fruit flies reproduce the largest number of living offspring and whether or not eye type affected this.<br><br> To complete this project, fruit flies were attained. They were then sexed and placed into vials with three males and three females in each. They were divided into test groups accordingly and placed in the appropriate place. The vials were labeled according to their eye type and light subjection.<br><br> Shortly after sexing and separating the flies, a large death rate was observed. It was hypothesized that this was due to the stress of anesthetizing the flies. Soon, a white mold was observed to be growing at the edge of the medium of some vials. It steadily progressed from a white color, to a brown, and then to a dark black powder. The vials with a large amount of this mold showed a 100% fatality rate. Due to the death rates caused by the anesthetizing and the mold presence, this project was deemed inconclusive.<br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANTS ON LIFESPAN AND STRESS RESPONSE IN GENETICALLY SUPPRESSED C. ELEGANS
David Brooks Kaufman, Khannan Kameshvaran Athreya, Basil Harbi Shadfan
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

In recent years, studies have shown that antioxidants can significantly extend lifespan in aerobic organisms by neutralizing the effects of harmful free radicals. This project’s purpose is to determine the effects of the antioxidants, Vitamin-C and a synthetic (CH3OC6H4OH), on the lifespan and protein production of C. elegans that have been genetically modified using the Age-1 and Daf-16 plasmids to suppress stress protein-producing genes. Groups of C. elegans were subjected to different combinations of the following three variables: a hyperoxic environment of 88.8% oxygen, different antioxidants, and two gene-suppressing plasmids. Hypothetically, C. elegans in an oxygen-rich environment that are given antioxidants and have stress protein genes suppressed should experience an extended lifespan because no energy is required of the worm to produce stress proteins that neutralize free radicals. It was found that worms in a control environment, with a natural antioxidant, and with no plasmid experienced the longest lifespan of 23.4 days. The supplemental antioxidants administered may have helped the worm neutralize free radicals. Electrophoresis gels showed that stress protein production in control groups was drastically less than that of groups under oxidative stress. The gels also showed that RNA interference was successful because the Daf-16 and Age-1 proteins were not translated. When the Age-1 and Daf-16 genes were suppressed and antioxidants were administered, lifespan was increased. This indicates that few stress proteins were produced, energy was saved by the worm, and the free radicals were sufficiently neutralized by the supplemental antioxidant.

AN EXCAVATION AND ANALYSIS OF RHINOCEROS FOSSILS OF THE GENUS TELEOCERAS FROM THE OGALLALA FORMATION OF THE MIOCENE NORTH OF CHEYENNE, WYOMING
Shana Marie Wolff, Stephanie Ann Carter
McCormick Junior High School, Cheyenne, WY

The purpose of this experiment was to excavate and analyze bones found 3 miles north of Cheyenne, Wyoming, buried beneath and exposed on the surface of the prairie. The bones were found in the Ogallala Formation of the late or upper Miocene Epoch, 5-10 million years ago. Because of the geology of the area, location on the grasslands of the great plains, and very large size of the fossilized bones, the animal was believed to be the fossilized remains of a Teleoceras, an extinct member of the rhinoceros group. We believed the mature animal was a single animal that died, either due to predation by carnivores or from natural causes and was scavenged by carnivores because of teeth marks on some of the bones. The first cervical vertebra, the atlas, and parts of the rib cage were found at the point of the Teleoceras’s death, or more likely, washed downstream from the point of death, since the fossilized bones were found encased in conglomerate rock as would be found in a fast flowing stream. Two or more ribs fell off the rib cage as the carcass was moved from this downstream site by stream flow or scavengers and deposited 43 meters away. The scattered atlas vertebra and ribs were likely deposited in a stream bed or river flood plain and quickly buried in sediment to allow fossilization to occur before decay or consumption by scavengers.

A STUDY OF GROUP DYNAMICS AND VARIATION IN THE BEADLET ANEMONE ( ACTINIA EQUINA )
Darran Joseph Treanor, Fergal Daniel Garvey
Abbey Grammar School, Courtenay Hill, Newry. Co. Down. Northern Ireland BT342ED

A group dynamics study, on a Beadlet Anemone (Actinia equina) population on an exposed rocky shore of Carlingford Lough, Northern Ireland, was carried out over four time zones, namely, autumn, winter, spring and summer.<br><br>Systematic sampling was carried out across the littoral zone to examine the dispersion of phenotypes and individual spacing. Initial investigations suggested the presence of three sub-species which have evolved differences in coloration, ecological requirements and behavioral characteristics.<br><br>Three column colors were present, namely, dark red, brown and green. Red was the dominant phenotype, occupying the upper and mid sections of the littoral zone with the green and brown being confined to the lower section. The red phenotype, were more colonial than the green and brown which tended to be solitary. ‘Nearest neighbor distance’ for the red suggested both sexual and asexual reproduction, whereas evidence for the green and brown phenotypes suggested asexual means. The red phenotype, which produced offspring in the summer, had juveniles tending to cluster in their parental territory. However the green and brown, which produced their juveniles in autumn, dispersed more widely. Aggression was used as a means of determining spatial distribution. The red phenotype was found to be more aggressive in staged confrontations against green and brown anemones. Intra-clonal aggression in red was rare, whereas it seemed to be a determining factor in the spatial distribution of other red clusters.<br><br>This study suggests that a combination of reproductive viability and aggressive behavior are accelerating the pace of divergent evolution in this species.<br><br>

THE PREVALENCE OF PORCINE STRESS SYNDROME IN MARKET HOGS AT WASHINGTON STATE JUNIOR LIVESTOCK SHOWS
Brittany Rae Carlson, Karl Haisch
Sumner High School Sumner, WA U.S.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS) in market hogs. Forty-three pigs were selected from five livestock shows based on their class ranking. Classes were established by the animals weight and only champions from weight classes were chosen for participation in the experiment. Approximately 2 ml. of blood was drawn from each champion pig and analyzed using the Hal-1843 molecular genetic test for PSS. Twenty-two of the market hogs tested were homozygous wild-type (NN), Eighteen were heterozygous (Nn), and one was homozygous positive (nn). Two samples were unable to be analyzed because of errors during the molecular test. The results of this investigation indicate that Porcine Stress Syndrome is indeed prevalent in Washington State Livestock shows, and further investigations should be done in determining means of eradication of the disease.

REPELLENT AND/OR INSECTICIDE EFFECT OF OCIMUM BASILICUM (BASIL) IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Lisselle Marie Villarrubia, Eileen M. Soto-Ruiz
Dr. Carlos Gonzalez, Aguada, Puerto Rico

<br><br>This research was conducted to determine if Ocimum basilicum L. (basil) has insecticide and/or repellent properties toward Drosophila melanogaster. If effective it will be useful to prevent D. melanogaster from getting to food sources and/or the human body.<br><br>To perform this research the basil plant was used. To cultivate D. melanogaster, three boxes of polycarbonate material were made with the specifications necessary for its development. Fruits in advanced decomposition stages were placed in the boxes for five days to obtain an adequate D. melanogaster population. Extracts of the basil plant were used to prepare different dilutions to be used in each treatment. These treatments were: 1) pure extract; 2) distillate water alone; 3) three different dilutions of the pure extract (1:1- 50 mL of pure extract and 50 mL distillate water, 1:3- 25 mL of pure extract and 75 mL of distillate water, 3:1- 75 mL of pure extract and 25 mL of distillate water). After applying these treatments the effects were observed at three different times and the data obtained was statistically analyzed.<br><br>According to the data obtained the hypothesis was proven to be true, since the basil plant acted as a repellent and as an insecticide. Pure extract and the highest dilution (3:1) were the most effective against D. melanogaster, preventing it from getting to fruits and human body. This confirms that the basil can be used as an effective and natural alternative to reduce the indiscriminate use of insecticides, which affect negatively the environment. <br><br>

ECOLOGY OF THE INTERTIDAL ZONE: A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF MUSSELS ON THE BIODIVERSITY OF CONSPICUOUS BIOTA
Sarah G Wood, Michele Lanctot
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA, USA

In this study a transect in the intertidal zone of Davenport Landing State Beach is monitored to determine if the population of mussels impacts the biodiversity of the community. In the1970?s, this same 15 x 3 m transect was chosen to monitor a mussel bed, in order to establish a baseline for comparing future changes. It is hypothesized, that a large mussel population restricts other organisms from inhabiting the substrate: thus lowering community biodiversity. Over thirty species are counted(including anemones, coralline algae and chitons) in four random quadrats along the transect at low tide, twice a month. The biodiversity of each quadrat (H?) is calculated (using the Shannon Diversity Index) by comparing the relative proportion of each species compared to the total number of all individuals. Results were found by comparing the biodiversity (H?) to the number of mussels versus bare rock. The preliminary results indicate that the biodiversity is higher in quadrats with less mussel abundance and a greater proportion of bare rock. Our study demonstates that where mussels are less abundant species such as anemones, coralline algae and chitons increase in number, therefore supporting our hypothesis. It appears that space is the limiting factor in determining biodiversity in the intertidal zone and where there are less mussels(less competition for space) there is a greater diversity of intertidal organisms.

TENTATIVE STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE ON FISH
Zhaoming Peng, Xi Wang, Chun Li
No.1 High School Attached to Central China Normal University

The present long-term experiment was designed to investigate the effect of blue-green-algal meal on growth of giber carp(Carassins anratns gibelio) and to build the relationship between microcystins in fish tissues and dietary contents. <br><br> Nutritional method was introduced into the chronic experiment. Six isonitrogenous(gross protein content 38%) and isoenergetic(gross energy content 17kJ/g) diets were formulated.In each diet,15% of dietary diet protein was provided by fish meal and the rest by the soybean meal and/or blue-green-algal meal.In six diets,the algae content was 0,15.15,29.79,44.69,59.58and 74.48%,respectively.Each diet was fed to 5 groups of giber carp for 12 weeks in a flow-through system. GOT and GPT were measured by photoelectric coloricmetry. The accumulation of microcystin in fish body was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br><br> The results showed that the mortality of giber carp increased with the increase in algal meal inclusion.The growth of fish fed the diet with containing 59.58% algae was significant lower.Liver GPT activity of fish fed the diet containing more than 44.69% algae were significant lower than that fed the diet without algae.Microcystin accumulated in fish muscle,liver,spleen and gall bladder.The liver showed the highest accumulation of microcystins.<br><br> It can be concluded that blue-green-algae can be used as dietary protein by gibel carp .According to the data,we can provide scientific basis for making a safe standard on microcystin content in food and animal feed. <br><br>

SPICY ANTS: FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE THE EFFECTS OF CAPSAICIN ON FORMICIDAE
Charles Daniel Knowles
Bay High School, Panama City FL, USA

My experiment examined the repelling effect of capsaicin on ants. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is an invasive species. They were introduced into North America in the 1930’s. They take over native ant species and can damage and destroy vegetation, livestock and even electrical structures. There is a need for an environmentally safe and affordable product to control fire ants.<br><br> Capsaicin is a substance found in chile peppers that give them the "hot" flavor that they are known for. The "hotness" of a pepper is measured in Scoville Units. The type of pepper that I used in my experiment, cayenne pepper, rates between 30,000 and 50,000 scoville units. The capsaicin found in cayenne pepper is not only detectable by taste; it can also have a very irritating when touched, such as applied when used in pepper spray. <br><br> In my experiment, I introduced ground cayenne pepper into ants’ natural environment, to test if they would walk on it. The actual process involved covering half of each 4'' by 4'' test area with ground cayenne pepper and observing and recording the actions of the ants in the test area. After 5 minutes, the number of ants in each sector of the test area was recorded. <br><br> The data collected supported my hypothesis. There were considerably fewer ants recorded in pepper sectors of test areas than in control sectors of the test areas in all tests. This leads me to believe that capsaicin is a very effective and safe ant repellent.<br><br>

BUGNIP III
Cassandra Marie Wagner
Lemon Bay High School, Port Charlotte FL, USA

This purpose of this experiment was to find a repellency rate of BUGNIP, the homeopathic insect repellent developed by the student researcher, when used as a botanical application on Cucurbita pepo against the plant parasite, Bemesia argentifolii. Squash crops throughout the world fall prey to plant parasites which mutilate, disfigure, and kill the plant. This experimentation’s purpose is to discover an environmentally safe approach to protecting these agricultural crops; one that is desperately needed. <br><br> The experimental procedure called for use of the plant specimen and the plant parasite to be introduced to each other in a contained environment. In each trial, one plant specimen was treated with two milliliters of BUGNIP and the other was left untreated. The Bemesia argentifolii specimens were placed in the center of each contained experiment. Each plant specimen was noted for insect infestation at exact increments of time, ending with a final reading at the sixty minute increment. The data of that increment was used to calculate the results.<br><br> The test results of all testing show a high repellency rate of BUGNIP. Through a set of sixteen trials, it was found that BUGNIP had an average repellency rate of seventy-five percent. <br><br> It is concluded that BUGNIP is highly effective when used in a botanical application. However, the hypothesis stated a range of fifty to seventy percent repellency, and through experimentation it was found BUGNIP exceeded that range with its repellency rate of seventy-five percent, making the hypothesis partially correct.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ESFENVALERATE ON THE FERTILIZATION AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF EUCIDARIS TRIBULOIDESIS
Kimberly May Sparling
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, Florida, USA

The true effects of pesticides on many organisms are still unknown. The aim of this study was to observe how esfenvalerate, the active ingredient in Bug-B-Gone®, affected the fertilization and early development of Eucidaris tribuloidesis. <br><br> It was hypothesized that this pesticide would have a negative effect on the early development and fertilization of the organisms. 21 specimens of Eucidaris tribuloidesis were obtained and spawned, by injecting 0.2 mL of a 0.5 M KCL solution. Their gametes were collected and, after making a sperm dilution and egg suspension, fertilized. This was repeated twice using saline solution. The procedure was then replicated using 0.25%, 0.5%, and 2% (v/v) pesticide solutions, each performed 3 times per concentration. Cell divisions were then observed, with special note given to the time length and characteristics of the divisions. <br><br>The results demonstrate that higher concentrations of pesticide caused more abnormalities in development. The cells in 0.25% and 0.5% pesticide solutions showed delays in cleavages ranging from 1 to 2 hours. Polyspermy was also observed with the cells in the 2% pesticide solutions. These cells also were noted to have a delayed cleavage, but before first division, cell lysis occurred. <br><br> This experiment demonstrates that even dilute concentrations of pesticides can have very dramatic effects on the early reproduction of Eucidaris tribuloidesis. Pesticides may have similar effects on other marine organisms and has the potential of destroying whole marine ecosystems by causing reproductive failure of key organisms, such as Eucidaris tribuloidesis. <br><br>

RELATING DISTANCE BETWEEN LION PRIDES WITH NEED FOR MALE PROTECTION
Heidi Mei-On Chun
St. Paul Academy and Summit School, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA

Male coalitions of one to eight lions breed with multiple females, which sometimes come from separate prides. The threat of infanticide by foreign males makes it necessary for the fathers to remain with the cubs. To protect multiple prides, a coalition travels between and gets “shared” by them. My investigation analyzes if the prides move closer together while sharing males and if it relates to the vulnerability of their cubs. My data comes from a 2500 km2 study area in Serengeti National Park that includes over 250 lions. To begin my research, I took a mass data file of all the lions’ locations and sorted them by pride. Next, I calculated the distance between prides (1) when they were sharing and (2) when they weren’t. Also, I graphed them on a GIS program and analyzed their locations in relation to each other. Finally, I looked for a relationship between the age of sharing prides’ cubs and the distance between the prides. In over 50% of sharing instances, the prides had cubs under six months old. In 97.3% of these instances, the prides moved closer together while sharing. However, when sharing prides had cubs twelve to twenty-four months old, they moved closer together only 66.7% time. Thus, prides sharing males move closer together to gain better protection for their cubs. As their cubs grow older and more independent, the prides don’t need the males’ protection and move farther apart into their original territories.

FREQUENCY OF FEEDER VISITS BY CARPODACUS MEXICANUS VS. TEMPERATURE
Laura Rose Brueggen
Brueggen homeschool, Bethany, Oklahoma, United States of America

This project studies the relationship between the number of Carpodacus mexicanus visits to feeders and the outside temperature during late fall and early winter. In cold temperatures Carpodacus mexicanus will need to eat more to maintain constant body temperature. It is hypothesized that during this time, Carpodacus mexicanus will feed more frequently when temperatures are colder.<br><br> This project studied the number of Carpodacus mexicanus that visited my backyard feeders in November, December, and January. Four feeders were placed in my backyard and observed for one hour each morning, 8:45 to 9:45 a.m., regardless of the weather. The number of feeder visits was recorded. Weather conditions were recorded. Temperature data was taken from the nearest Oklahoma Mesonet station in Spencer, Oklahoma.<br><br> Carpodacus mexicanus visited the feeders singly and in groups of all sizes. They did not visit feeders during precipitation. The data collected showed no significant correlation between the feeder visits and the temperatures of the current day, one day previous, and four days previous to the count. Significant inverse, logarithmic relationships were discovered between the number of feeder visits and temperatures 2 and 3 days previous to the count date. As temperatures increased the number of feeder visits decreased. At 40° F- 50°F the number of feeder visits leveled off. These results fit the concept that Carpodacus mexicanus will need to restore their energy reserves after depletion due to cold weather stress.<br><br>

MCARTHUR DRIVE LANDFILL- SUPERFUND SITE: FIELD STUDY AND LABORATORY SIMULATION OF HEAVY METAL ACCUMULATION IN FRESHWATER MUSSELS
Rachel Elizabeth Sass
Mid-Buchanan R-V, Faucett, Missouri, USA

The McArthur Drive Landfill Site (MDLS) is a closed landfill located on the east bank of the Missouri River that received local and industrial wastes during the 1950s and 1960s. A field study was conducted to determine if elevated levels of heavy metals (copper, manganese, and lead) would be found in freshwater mussels. Mussels are excellent bio-indicators of water quality. It was hypothesized that the mussels found next to the MDLS would have the highest level of heavy metals. Water samples were taken at four sites along the bank (upstream; adjacent to the MDLS; Roy's Branch, a creek that borders the MDLS; and one site downstream). Each site was combed for live mussels, but no live mussels were found at any site. Water sample analysis showed an elevated level for each metal at the site next to the MDLS. This data supported the theory that heavy metals may still be present from the landfill. A lab study was then conducted to determine which metal was absorbed in the largest amount. It was hypothesized that copper would have the largest amount of absorption. Mussels were exposed for six weeks and the soft tissue was extracted and digested for analysis by the Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Copper produced the largest amount of absorption and caused highest mortality. The toxicity of these metals to freshwater mussels could suggest why no mussels were found next to the landfill.

THE EFFECTS OF COMMON ANESTHETIC AGENTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Lydia Patrice Wheeler
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, Mississippi, United States of America

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide on the behavior of the common fruit fly. The flies were exposed to various doses of anesthesia for five minutes and then carefully monitored. The number of flies exhibiting various behaviors was recorded. Chi-Squared tests were performed to determine if the outcome was affected by the type of fly. The tests showed that the types of flies reacted about the same in regards to their dosage. The 100% dose of both types of anesthesia showed a startlingly dramatic negative trend in every type of fruit fly. I observed no real harmful effect by the 25% and 50% doses of anesthesia.

DOES THE APPLICATION OF WEEDMASTER AFFECT THE EFFICACY OF THE "MOLE CRICKET NEMATODE" (STEINERNEMA SCAPTERISCI) TO CONTROL PEST MOLE CRICKETS? (A FIVE-YEAR STUDY)
Tyler A. Gary
DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida, USA

Florida cattlemen are seeking a cost-effective and permanent solution to the damage caused by non-indigenous mole crickets on bahiagrass in Florida. Approximately 75% of the 3.5 million acres of improved pastures that support the 1.2 million-head cow-calf industry in Florida consist of bahiagrass pastures. Since 1996, about 400,000 acres of bahiagrass pasture have been destroyed by mole cricket infestation. In addition, mole crickets have caused an annual loss of $6 million in bahiagrass hay revenue.<br><br> Six sound traps and six pit-fall traps were used in order to collect the pest mole crickets for this experiment. Two ranch locations were utilized in this study. These ranches were six miles distant from each other. Three sound traps and three pit-fall traps were used on each ranch. When these twelve traps failed to collect a single mole cricket, two one-acre plots were flooded with water for a twenty-four hour period. These flooded plots also failed to produce a single mole cricket. At this time the procedures were altered to exclude the use of mole crickets and investigate the affect of Weedmaster on the “mole cricket nematode” (S. scapterisci) directly. <br><br> In this study, six concentrations of Weedmaster were evaluated to determine their effect on the mole cricket nematode. These concentrations were as follows: 0%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20%.<br><br> The results of this study suggest that Weedmaster, even when applied at 50% of the recommended rate of 2% concentration, adversely affected the survivability of the mole cricket nematode.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON ARTHROPODS' WALKING MANNER
Pengyuan Zang
Beijing No.22 Middle School, Beijing, China

To conduct a preliminary study on the walking manner and evolutionary rules thereof in Arthropods, representative animals in terrigenous Crustacea, Arachnida, Myriapoda and Insecta were observed by a video camera. The videos were studied frame by frame by using playing back and data analysis methods and establishing a mathematical model on computer. The movement features of each of the representative animals were summarized through comparison. A mathematical model was established for the walking manner of each of the representative animals. And thereby some evolutionary rules on arthropods' walking manner were discovered. Results indicate that, with the evolutionary advancement, appendages of certain arthromeres degenerate. Simultaneous movement of each pair of legs evolves to alternate movement. The number of the polygons (or the sides of polygon) formed by linking the feet that touch the ground when the arthropods walk, decreases. Therefore, the movement manner of the animals evolves towards more flexibility. The walking manner of each pair of legs becomes more complex and more different from each other. The walking tracks of all representative animals can be characterized by computer-generated mathematical model of vertical waves. The relationship between the propagation direction and walking direction evolves from consistent to opposite.

GENETIC ANALYSIS OF MEIOTIC MUTANTS IN DROSOPHILA
Neha Anil Deshpande
South Brunswick High School, Monmouth Junction NJ, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment is to use the power of D. melanogaster genetics to identify new genes required for the process of meiotic recombination and to map their locations using genetic tests. The eventual analysis of the protein products of these genes will provide clues to their specific biochemical activity. In many cases, similar genes will be present in humans and, therefore, these studies may provide insights into possible therapies to prevent nondisjunction in humans, such as medication or nutritional supplements. This may lead to the prevention of birth disorders like Down’s syndrome, a disorder caused by chromosomal nondisjunction in humans and coupled with increasing maternal age. <br><br> I utilized the process of EMS mutagenesis along with various genetic crosses to isolate a mutant with defective meiosis. I induced a mutation in one of the 10-20 genes out the 7,000 on the 3rd chromosome responsible for chromosome segregation during meiosis. Thus, I discovered a new gene in fruit flies that maintains high levels of crossing over and prevents nondisjunction. <br><br> I also used deficiency and three-point mapping techniques to map two genes discovered from previous mutagenesis experiments. I concluded that the two genes, both with essential roles in meiosis, lie on the left-arm of the 2nd chromosome within the region 28E4-38A1 near the genetic black gene. Mapping these genes to a smaller region of DNA will facilitate a positional cloning approach and provide clues into the molecular defects causing nondisjunction in Drosophila and possibly common birth defects and disorders in humans.

COMPARISON OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS: DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCE OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Zoe Elizabeth Teague
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States

A series of experiments were performed to determine the acceptance and preference of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) for sweeteners. No choice and choice tests were performed examining acceptance of a natural sweetener, sucrose, and three artificial sweeteners, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose. <br><br> The test substances were dyed with red and blue food coloring in order to determine the intake of the fruit flies by counting their dyed fecal specks after 24 hours exposure. Preliminary choice tests were conducted to determine color preference and whether the test procedure could be used to test the flies' ability to discriminate between sweetened and non-sweetened solutions. No choice tests were conducted to evaluate acceptance of test substances (sucrose, aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and distilled water). The choice tests compared aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and distilled water, with sucrose as the control.<br><br> For the procedure, 7-10 flies in a two-sectioned petri dish were provided with a choice of a dyed (red or blue) 10% sucrose solution and a test substance dyed the alternate color. Solutions were presented to the flies on saturated 1cm3 sections of floral foam. The test substances were in one half of the petri dish, and a semicircular piece of filter paper in the other half. The flies were left in the dishes for 24 hours in a controlled environment. They were then removed and put in a freezer and left again for 24 hours. It was found that the fruit flies had no color preference between red or blue food coloring, were able to discriminate between sweetened and non-sweetened solutions, and the flies accepted all natural and artificial sweeteners and water when not given a choice. The sucrose was chosen over all other substances except for aspartame, where there was no dominant preference.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF A COMMON CORN CRIMINAL: PHASE TWO
DJ Ray Horton
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss Colorado

Heterorhabditis nematodes can effectively infest and kill sap beetles. However, nematodes can only move short distances in search of a host. The researcher’s hypothesis is that this problem can be solved by using the following methods. Traps constructed from PVC pipe, and containing bait saturated with nematodes will attract beetles. The beetles will then act as carriers for the juvenile nematodes. These “carrier” beetles will, after being infested, carry the nematodes back to the beetle colony. Upon the beetle’s death, the juvenile nematodes inside the beetle’s body will be released to infect other beetles nearby. The following experiments were designed to further investigate this hypothesis. Experiment 1: Four groups of 25 beetles were placed in Petri dishes containing sap beetle diet. Fifteen heterorhabditis nematodes were then introduced into each of the sap beetle environments. Five days later a count was taken of the number of dead beetles. These dead beetles were then dissected to ensure that infestation was the cause of death. Experiment 2: A pheromone wind tunnel (12’x2’x2’) was constructed. Two Petri dishes, containing bait, were then placed in the wind tunnel. Air was allowed to flow through the tunnel for 10 minutes. Next, groups of 40 beetles were placed downwind from the bait. After a ten minute period, a count was taken examining the number of beetles traveling upwind, downwind, and not moving at all. A similar count was taken after 20 minutes and again after 30 minutes. This process was conducted a total of three times. ANOVA found significance.

THE BUZZ ON BEES: THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND NICOTINE ON PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN THE BRAIN OF THE APIS MELLIFERA, A FIFTH YEAR STUDY ON HONEY BEES AS AN ETHANOL MODEL
Russell Thomas Burrows
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX 

This study investigated the effects of alcohol and nicotine on the c-fos transcription factor in the brain of the Apis mellifera. An increase in c-fos expression would indicate that alcohol and nicotine were applying stress to the brain. The expression of this transcription factor can affect the transcription of later genes in the brain. It was hypothesized that alcohol and/or nicotine would trigger some change in c-fos expression in the brain of the honey bee. <br><br> Four test groups were used in this study. Treatments were prepared and administered to restrained worker honey bees and consisted of ethanol/sucrose solution, nicotine (equivalent to 20 cigarettes worth of nicotine), a combination of ethanol and nicotine, and the control (no feeding). Following consumption of the treatments, the bee’s heads were removed and the brains dissected out. The brains were then sectioned on a cryostat and stained using immunofluorescent techniques with an antibody for c-fos and avidin-d as the fluorescing agent. The sections were mounted and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively using confocal microscopy.<br><br> Results revealed that the consumption of both alcohol and nicotine caused the most c-fos expression followed by treatments of alcohol, nicotine, and the control group. The significance of the results is validated by both ANOVA and t-Tests. Prior studies in this model tested honey bee responses to alcohol inhibitors/inducers in consumption and associative learning experiments, and analyzed biogenic amine levels. Combined studies indicate that honey bees would make ideal, inexpensive assays in alcohol and drug abuse studies.<br><br>

The focus of this study was Navicular Disease, a chronic degenerative condition occurring in the domestic horse. The cause of Navicular Disease is unknown, although there is an understanding of what is taking place when the disease exists. In this experiment, I related nutritional imbalances to a horse’s probability of contracting Navicular Disease. My experiment was focused around a new concept, therefore making it necessary to use a model in order to prevent dangerous situations for the animal. To test my hypothesis, I created bones to test for degeneration. The materials that I used included calcium carbonate, water, and plaster. They were also tested for strength so that it was known that they were very similar to actual bones. The bones that I created were the Navicular bone, short pastern bone, and coffin bone. The Navicular bone was weighed on a 200g scale before testing. I submerged this entire model in a solution of water and salt, as it would be within a horse’s body. I then ran the deep flexor tendon, which was made of rubber, around the Navicular bone and attached it to a jigsaw. I ran the jigsaw so that the deep flexor tendon would move in the same fashion as it would in a horse’s leg. After the jigsaw had been running for an hour, I removed the Navicular bone and weighed it, comparing it to its original weight. My results showed an ideal amount of calcium that a horse should receive. Anything below this level (malnourishment) or dramatically above this level showed harmful results, thus proving the relationship between nutritional imbalances and navicular disease.

THE EFFECTS OF WARM TEMPERATURES ON ZEBRA MUSSELS
Nicole Kristine Ward
Century High School, Rochester, MN, USA

In 2001, there was a die-off of zebra mussels in the Mississippi River. It was hypothesized that the temperature of the water affected the mussels. This experiment is to find how increasing water temperature affects zebra mussel survival.<br><br> It is hypothesized that with rising temperatures the survival rate of zebra mussels will decrease.<br><br> Petri dishes were prepared to allow water to flow in and out. Water baths were equilibrated to temperatures of 12, 18, 24, and 30°C. Zebra mussels were harvested off of the bottom of a pontoon boat and 8 mussels were placed into each of the petri dishes. Cold, fresh lake water was placed into the water baths. Eight petri dishes were placed in each of the water baths and brought up to temperature (in 15 min.). Mussels were tested daily for signs of life. The 30°C water bath reached 33°C overnight and all the mussels were dead. A new group was started at 29°C.<br><br> Zebra mussel mortality started to occur at 24°C and reached a 100% mortality rate at 33°C within one day.

"GONE FISHING FOR THE LAST TIME"
Kathryn Jolene Sanderlin
Drew Central High School, Monticello, Arkansas, USA

Channel catfish (Ictaburus punctatus), account for approximately $425 million in the aquaculture industry. The digestibility study was conducted to determine the digestibility energy and apparent nutrient digestibility of phospholipids versus triglycerides. <br><br> The isotope analysis was conducted to obtain quantitative estimates of the assimilation of lipids in the two different forms. An analysis was performed on the feces collected over a period of eight weeks for lipid and chromium content and a whole body analysis was performed using a stable carbon isotope tracer. The hypothesis was the fish would assimilate a higher level of phospholipids over the triglycerides.<br><br> Thirty-six channel catfish (Ictaburus punctatus) were divided by weight into nine groups and fed different diets with the two forms of lipid additives. The digestibility diets contained a 10% increase in lipids and the isotope analysis diets contained a 14% increase in lipids and the stable carbon isotope. The study was conducted for a period of eight weeks. <br><br> The apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) and isotope stable carbon isotope analysis revealed no significant difference in the assimilation of lipid content in the feces or the weight gain between the two diets. However, the study did reveal a significant difference in body fat in the fish on the phospholipids diet. This information could be useful in the production <br><br>of food fish. Less body fat means an increase the dress-out yield of processed fish. <br><br> <br><br>

ZOOPLANKTON POPULATION DYNAMICS IN RELATION TO TIME, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, DEPTH, AND TEMPERATURE
Elizabeth Ann Bassett
Bagley High School, Bagley, MN, United States of America

Zooplankton are vital to the biological integrity of aquatic environments. As the first secondary consumers, zooplankton support the beginning of the aquatic food chain and thereby affect the overall health and productivity of the environment in which they exist. If a lake supports a stable and biologically diverse population of zooplankton, fish populations will in turn be healthier, resulting in greater economic stability in the fishing industry and the many resorts and other businesses that depend on Minnesota’s thousands of lakes for yearly revenue. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to determine what factors and relationships time, dissolved oxygen, depth, and water temperature had on the bio-diversity and species richness within Lake Plantanganet, a mesotrophic lake located in Beltrami County, Bemidji, MN. 2,933 individual zooplankton were identified. Among these organisms identified were members of the phylum Rotifera including Keratella, Polyarthra, and Asplancha. Under the subclass Copepoda, Cyclopoids and Calanoids were found. Under the subclass Cladocera were Daphnia and Bosmina. In conclusion, my data did support my hypothesis that oxygen levels would influence zooplankton populations in Lake Plantanganet. At site 2, as dissolved oxygen levels decrease, Daphnia and Cyclopoid levels also decreased. Water temperature did not have an effect on population levels as most populations did not trend up or down as the water cooled later into the fall and early winter. I performed a chi-squared test that resulted in a statistically significant difference in population levels at the three different sampling sites for Cyclopoids, Calanoids, Daphnia, Bosmina, and Asplancha.<br><br>

MAGGOTS, MEAT, AND MAYHEM
Genevieve Mount
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA, USA

The object of my experiment is to find out if, and how, the number of maggots on a piece of beef affects the length of their life cycle. I tested to see if the number of maggots on a controlled amount of beef liver would affect how long the maggots would take to grow from egg to pupa. My hypothesis was that the increase in the number of maggots on a controlled piece of meat would decrease the length of the maggots’ life cycle. I conducted my test with wild fly eggs collected by leaving a piece of beef liver out for a day. I raised the maggots in shallow round containers. There were 4 sets of containers with 10 eggs in them and 4 sets with 20 eggs. Each container had 5 grams of beef live in it. I repeated this setup 5 times. The testing environment was controlled, the temperature, humidity, amount of meat and all other factors were held constant. The number of maggots was the only variable. My results show that the number of maggots does have an effect on the length of their life cycle. The trend was that the greater the number of maggots on a piece of beef liver, the shorter the time they took to grow from egg to pupa.<br><br>

COLOR CHANGES DURING TERRITORIAL DEFENSE IN THE STEATOCRANUS CASUARIUS
Yin Yin Wu
J M Atherton High School, Louisville KY, US 

This experiment was designed to explore the features and significance of color changes displayed by the blockhead, Steatocranus casuarius, while engaged in territorial defense that commonly occurs in nature. <br><br> Twelve pairs of the male blockheads were tested. Confrontations were recorded and converted to the computer for later analysis. Pictures of territorially confrontational blockheads were captured and analyzed for red, green, and blue (RBG) values by the eyedropper tool in Adobe Photoshop and color fluctuations were analyzed visually.<br><br> The three coloration patterns that occurred during territorial defense behaviors were rapid light/ dark fluctuation (83%), stripes (64%), and spots (52%). 94% of aggressors who initiated contact by darting across the aquarium exhibited a lightening color change. 75% of those aggressors showed a lightening to darkening color change right before the first physical contact. Overall, blockheads showed increased RGB values during the climax of defensive confrontation. Defenders showed increased red and green values during chasing. Increased RGB values were found in defenders and aggressors during body hitting. The most significant RGB changes occurred in the frontal head and cheek regions. Confrontational durations were significantly lower when physical contacts were performed outside a clay pot in comparisons to inside a pot. Durations were shorter when the defenders displayed light stripes in the head region. <br><br> The contributions of this project include meaningful observations of special coloration patterns and the demonstration of the features of coloration changes and its significance to various levels of aggression. The use of RGB tools provided new perspectives on color analysis.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF SIGNAL MANIPULATION IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Zachary Carter Strickland
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether signal manipulations in Caenorhabditis elegans would have an affect on life extended varieties. Fifty Caenorhabditis elegans of each type (wild, DAF-2 and acetylcholine chloride) were subjected to the manipulation of odor and trained to respond to the odor in their food source. Three different concentrations were used (1.0%, .10%, and .01%). The Caenorhabditis elegans were monitored three times weekly and the chemotactic index was calculated for each group. Further, pharyngeal pumping response was measured weekly to detect any reduction in reactions for the three groups. Three total trials were completed.<br><br>The results showed that both the wild and extended life groups performed better than the control. The C. elegans that had a modification of the DAF-2 gene performed at a slightly lower rate than both the wild and the life extended acetylcholine chloride group. Manipulation of the signal, odor, was adapted and responded to by all groups. The wild improved 69.64%, the DAF-2 improved 49.7%, and the acetylcholine chloride improved 54.84%. Without the training, they continued to be attracted to the odor of the garlic.<br><br>The pharyngeal pumping test showed that both the wild and the life-extended acetylcholine chloride showed a reduction in their pumping reaction both prior to tapping and after tapping. The DAF-2 remained at a relatively constant rate throughout the four-week period.<br><br>Therefore, signal manipulation did have an affect on the performance of the Caenorhabditis elegans and their adaptation was not reduced by the extension of their life.<br><br>

DO SALMON GENES WEAR OUT ON THE FARM? A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GENETIC VARIABILITY AND HETEROZYGOSITY IN FARM AND WILD CHINOOK SALMON AND WILD SOCKEYE SALMON
Nicole Marion Jeffery
Barrow High School, Barrow, AK, U.S.

Genetic variability and heterozygosity in the DRB1 gene of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) were compared between groups of wild Sockeye salmon and farmed and wild Chinook salmon. I hypothesized that wild Sockeye salmon would have the highest levels of genetic variability and heterozygosity due to their large population. DNA was extracted from fin tissue and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was used to isolate the DRB1 gene in 10 wild Sockeye samples, seven wild Chinook samples, and one farmed Chinook. Sequences of nine farmed Chinook salmon were acquired from another source. The farmed Chinook salmon had an average percent genetic variability of 0.668%, the wild Chinook 0.560%, and the wild Sockeye 1.95%. Farmed Chinook salmon samples had an average heterozygosity of 2.37%, the wild Sockeye 2.20%, and the wild Chinook 1.07%. The average heterozygosity differences between farmed and wild Chinook were significant (t test at p = 0.1). The average variability between wild Chinook and Sockeye was also significant (t test at p = 0.05). Data suggest that wild Sockeye salmon have a more variable DRB1 gene. This could signify that wild Sockeye are better able to fight pathogens than wild Chinook salmon and/or selectively-bred farmed Chinook salmon.

TESTING ADAPTIVE MODELS OF SEX ALLOCATION IN A POLYMORPHIC SPECIES
Tiffany Sain-Yee Ko
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN, USA

Sex ratio is one of the best reflections of evolution because it plays a key role in the outcome of reproduction, one of the means by which evolution acts. Two hypotheses explaining the evolution of sex ratio, the Fisherian and the Trivers-Willard hypotheses, were tested in the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) by analyzing the sex ratios of nestlings. This species exhibits a genetic polymorphism, which causes differences in plumage (white or tan), and correlates with behavioral distinctions. These birds also mate dissasortatively, meaning white males mate with tan females and vice versa. For this study, DNA was extracted from blood samples taken from nestlings captured during the 2000-2004 breeding seasons. Sex was determined using a molecular method that detects the presence of the female-specific W chromosome. Although the average sex ratios of clutches did not differ from the ideally stable proportion of 0.5, tan male/white female pairs significantly altered sex ratio from year to year but not within a year. In contrast, white male/tan female pairs consistently produced even sex ratios across all years, however, within a year, sex ratio differed significantly between early and late clutches. The fact that each disassortative pair type adopted different allocation strategies suggests that the Trivers-Willard hypothesis is a better model to describe the evolution of sex ratio in this species. My results suggest that parents can facultatively alter sex ratios according to their own phenotype, genotype, and/or environmental conditions.

MOVEMENT BEHAVIORS OF JUMPING SPIDER HASARIUS ADANSONI IS ELICITED BY VISUAL BUT NOT OLFACTORY SIGNALS
Wen- Hao Liu
The Affiliated Senior High School of NKNU ,Kaohsiung,Taiwan

Jumping spiders of family Salticidae may use visual and/or olfactory signals for conspecifics/prey recognitions, and it is well known that the spiders have bright body coloration and this trait varies greatly between species. The jumping spider Hasarius adansoni found in southern Taiwan was used as the experimental material, and its movement behaviors toward conspecifics or preys were studied. The general movement patterns of H. adansoni in terms of agonistic, courtship, and hunting behaviors were first established. I hypothesize that visual and/or olfactory signal can induce jumping spiders to perform agonistic, courtship and attack behavioural patterns.<br><br> I subsequently manipulated the body coloration patterns by painting and examined whether such treatments would affect the movement patterns. When a male H. adansoni encountered another male decorated with changed coloration patterns, the intensity of its agonistic behavior (zigzag dance 1) decreased; while encountered a female decorated differently, the intensity of its courtship behavior (such as first leg erection) decreased also. Moreover, I separated the opposite sex pairs by barriers that allows (1) visual, (2) smell, and (3) both visual and smell contact. I found that courtship behavior could happen only if visual contact is allowed. These results demonstrated that jumping spiders recognize conspecifics of the same or different sex by visual but not olfactory signals. <br><br>

PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF CRICKETS BY ACOUSTIC BEHAVIOR AND MITOCHONDRIAL SEQUENCING
JHE-RONG WU
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School , Taipei, Taiwan

Crickets' voice was closely related to the behavior, and it is well known that female crickets of different species use the comprehensive acoustic behavior to distinguish their specific male. We selected several species of cricket from Taiwan to study the possible relationship between acoustic behavior and phylogeny. Crickets' voice was recorded digitally and analyzed by the software Cool Edit 2000. The resolution in acoustic features in terms of main frequency and time characteristics such as pulse number, chirp rate, and the length of chirp were different among species, though the minor frequency patterns appeared to be overlapping.<br><br>Moreover, we found that frequency characteristic differences among species were partially related to their phylogenetic relationship, which was not seen in temporal characteristics. The phylogeny of the crickets under study was also analyzed by amplifying the cytochrome oxidase I by polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing. The results were compiled and compared to the phylogenetic tree established by morphological characteristics. Our findings indicated that the DNA sequence analysis was correlated with morphological classification, while acoustic characteristics were only partially correlated. However, the difference of acoustic behavior could still be regarded as an identification index among species.<br><br>

NEST SITE MICROHABITAT INFLUENCES NEST TEMPERATURE AND OFFSPRING SEX RATIO OF THE DIAMONDBACK TERRAPIN (MALACLEMYS TERRAPIN)
Maria Malgorzata Wojakowski
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, New York, United States of America

Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) are estuarine turtles that exhibit nest site selection in the field and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) under constant incubation temperatures in laboratory studies. This study examined TSD in the field, where the temperature is unstable and a temperature gradient might exist within nest cavities. The goal was to investigate whether nest microhabitat variables influence nest temperature and offspring sex ratio and to determine whether vegetation is a factor in terrapin nest site selection. It was hypothesized that these relationships exist and play a significant role in terrapin nesting and development. Relationships among microhabitat variables, nest temperatures, and sex ratios were analyzed for 100 nests in Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York City. Analyses were performed using the complete temperature data set and the middle third period of incubation, the thermosensitive period during which hatchling sex is determined. Both analyses showed that microhabitat influences nest temperature and subsequently offspring sex ratio. Analyses using complete temperature data suggested bare ground, not vegetation, is the most accurate indicator of nest temperature. Analyses of the middle third period revealed that all microhabitat variables except dicotyledonous plants influence mean nest temperature during this critical time. Sex ratio analyses supported the presence of TSD in the field and the statistical analyses, indicating that bare ground is the most likely predictor of nest temperature for females. This finding strongly suggests that bare ground is the most important factor in nest site selection and nest site selection is the evolutionary agent of TSD.

INHIBITION OF CELL RECOGNITION AND REAGGREGATION BY CHITIN AND CHITINASE IN THE SPONGE MICROCIONA PROLIFERA (A POSSIBLE MODEL FOR THE CAUSE AND EFFECTS OF RAD)
Vinay Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, California, U.S.A.

Previous research has shown that chitin may have antigenic properties leading to bronchial constriction in mice exposed to chitin (Elias, et al. 2004). The study outlined below supports the hypothesis that chitin may act as an allergen that inhibits cell-cell recognition, leading to an immune response characteristic of Reactive Airway Disease (RAD). Microciona prolifera, a marine sponge, was selected to demonstrate the inhibition of cell-cell recognition by chitin and chitinase as a function of reduced cell reaggregation. Cells were teased apart and diluted to 1.8 x 10^7 cells per µL, and specified amounts of chitin and chitinase were added to each group. The inhibition of cell reaggregation was measured through the use of a hemocytometer. The most significant results yielded an 80.1 % reaggregation inhibition at a chitin concentration of 1mg/15mLs. Interestingly chitinase (alone) also inhibited cell reaggregation by 79.2% at a concentration of 1 unit per 15mLs. Curvilinear graphs were derived from the data for chitin and chitinase, and the graphs had reliability coefficients of 0.82 and 0.99 respectively. Results supported the model proposing that chitin-induced inhibition of cell-cell recognition may be related to an immune response and possibly RAD. Ongoing experimentation using gel electrophoresis of surface proteins suggests that chitinase may be altering the structure of the surface proteins and their attached oligosaccharides. The evolutionary advantage of normal production of chitinase is understandable. However, in individuals exposed to chitin, who show asthmatic symptoms, an induced overproduction of chitinase may also inhibit cell-cell recognition, thus stimulating an immune response.

DOES THE SELECTION OF BREEDER REPLACEMENT HEN TURKEYS BY AVERAGE BODY WEIGHT IMPROVE BREEDER FLOCK RATE OF LAY?
Travis Elliott Schaffer
North Daviess High School, Elnora, Indiana, USA

Integrated commercial turkey operations depend on breeder flocks to supply eggs for the hatchery for the eventual production of turkey poults. The purpose of this project was to determine if the selection of breeder replacement hen turkeys to improve the body weight uniformity will significantly result in increased rate of lay. The following precedure was accomplished by myself and Perdue employees: weighing each bird individually, dividing the turkeys into two groups and altering their nutrition to cause the flock to become more uniform. By improving the uniformity the birds body weight and conditioning was able to sustain ideal egg production, reduce mortality, reduce cull eggs, and improve flock fertility resulting in better hatchability. The study included two breeds: British United Turkeys of America, and Nicholas involving three flocks per farm for a total of 210,000 hens evaluated. The hens in this study produced an excess of 1.7 million eggs. Replacement hens were reared and fed according to the primary breeder specifications and the candidates were selected at twenty weeks of age. The two lots were weighed weekly by Perdue employees and myself to monitor their progress against the body weight standard. The birds required different diets to control the growth rate after selection. The statistical analyses were applied to the uniformity and egg production results of both Nicholas and BUTA breed. The results showed that B.U.T.A strongly outperformed the other breed on all aspects of the project including an average of seven poults per hen better. The eggs per hen and poults per hens were significantly higher in BUTA than Nicholas (P < 0.01). There was no difference in fertility between BUTA and Nicholas (P < 0.9). Hatchability showed a slight advantage for BUTA but the P value was only (P < .08). Mortality and cull eggs were higher in Nicholas than BUTA and both were highly significant (P < 0.0001). B.U.T.A outperformed the other breeds on poults per hen by a combined difference of 6.8 poults. <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHROMIUM SUPPLEMENTATION AND BACULOVIRUS INFECTIONS IN HELIOTHIS VIRESCENS
Drew Francis Sanning
Miller Co. R-III, Tuscumbia, MO, United States

Baculoviruses have been suggested as safe and effective alternatives to chemical pesticides for managing certain pest insects. Chromium is an element commonly found in the environment at varying concentration levels and its uptake by plants has been documented. Recently, more chromium has found its way into the environment by way of sewage sludge field application. Chromium is an essential nutrient for humans and animals. However, chromium at a high concentration level can be extremely toxic. To date there are no studies that have investigated the relationship between chromium in the diet of herbivorous insects and its impact on baculovirus infections. In this study Heliothis virescens (budworm) were fed chromium at varying concentrations in the diet. The budworms were then exposed to a baculovirus at one of four concentration levels. There were a total of four hundred eighty insects in this study, thirty insects per treatment group with four sub-groups to each treatment group. Development and mortality were monitored throughout the budworm’s life cycle. <br><br> Based on this study the following conclusions can be drawn:<br><br> 1. The high (10,000 ppb) level of chromium supplementation stimulated both the growth and development of the budworm larva.<br><br> 2. The high (10,000 ppb) level of chromium supplementation provided protection against the baculovirus at a medium infection dose.<br><br>

Los Lunas High School, Los Lunas, New Mexico, USA

Purpose: To determine if there are morphological characteristics of immature Kokanee salmon (Jacks & Jills*) which can be used in the field to determine their gender without harming them.<br><br>Hypothesis: There is a unique morphological characteristic of Kokanee salmon which can be used to sex them at any time during the year.<br><br>Procedures: The data used in the statistical analyses were obtained from fishermen's creels at Navajo Dam Reservoir, New Mexico. The data was a compilation of various morphological measurements of the Kokanee salmon. Statistical tests performed were the Chi-Square and the Two Sample t-Test comparing age groups, gender type,and year-class of the fish.<br><br>Results & Conclusions: A new measurement, body length, was derived by subtracting the head length from the total length. This measurement permitted the calculation of the ratio of head length to body length (H.L. /B.L.). The H.L. /B.L. ratio between the gender classes and all age groups is significantly different. The Chi-Square analysis of this ratio yielded a p<0.01 (99% level). An analysis with the Two Sample t-Test was performed between age groups, year classes, and gender classes resulting in a p<0.001 (99.9% level). It is now possible to differentiate between the sexes at any time of the year. I generated a field guide for fisheries scientists to allow them to easily identify sex of Kokanee salmon.<br><br>*Kokanee salmon Jills, non-spawning females, were first identified and documented by S.L. Clary in 2002.<br><br>

MOSQUITO VECTORS DISEASE POTENTIAL AND CONTROL EFFICACY
Meghan Elizabeth Hermance
Academy of Science and Technology, Oak Ridge High School, Conroe Texas, USA

This study focused on the presence and distribution of disease vector mosquito species over a seven month time period. Mosquito control efforts were also examined for effectivness. <br><br> Mosquitoes were trapped biweekly at two locations. Light and gravid traps were used to collect specimens. More than 4,800 specimens were identified and typed under a dissecting microscope. Trap count data was used to determine the distribution of mosquito species at each location. Species data was plotted with temperature and precipitation. The Shannon-Weiner Index was calculated for each trap. <br><br> Precipitation appeared to have a controlling affect on mosquito populations. Population levels of Culex quinquefasciatus, a common vector for West Nile Virus, bloomed ten days to two weeks after rainfall. Culex quinquefasciatus population blooms also matched and partially controlled the total gravid trap count trends. The relatively low diversity index values associated with the gravid traps was consistent with the preferential concentration of “gravid” species in this type of trap. Light traps typically yielded greater diversity based on the Shannon-Weiner Index. <br><br> The differences between the trap types in the ability to concentrate the West Nile vector species indicates that a monitoring program focused on Culex quinquefasciatus would be enhanced by utilizing gravid traps. The correlation of mosquito activity to rainfall suggests that any mosquito abatement efforts focused on the West Nile vector Culex quinquefasciatus would be improved if larvicide was applied following periods of rainfall and throughout “dry” periods when water is stagnant. Focused monitoring and targeted abatement efforts will aid in reducing vector species populations and enhance the efficacy of disease control efforts.<br><br>

MAPPING MOSQUITO BIOMARKERS OF HORMONAL MANIPULATION
Kelydra Elizabeth Welcker
Parkersburg South High School, Parkersburg, WV, USA

Mosquitoes use steroid, terpenoid, and peptide hormones in their growth, development and reproduction. Any deviation from normal endogenous levels of these hormones can cause variations in mortality, growth, size, sex ratio, and wingbeat frequency or even induce physical deformities. Recent research has documented some human hormones and Endocrine Disruptive Chemicals (EDCs) causing similar variations.<br><br> Culturing mosquito larva in the presence of biologically active levels (0-500 parts per trillion) of either Juvenile Hormone or JH mimics affected overall hatch, generated smaller than normal females and shorter life spans in both male and female survivors, while steroids and endocrine disruptive chemicals primarily effected wingbeat frequency and size. Steroids usually increased adult mosquito size with the exception of hydrocortisone. Comparing the effects of steroid and terpenoid hormones to those elicited by two endocrine disruptive chemicals - styrene and Triton® verified the fact that these EDCs apparently bind to steroid nuclear receptors and cause variations in wingbeat frequency in the same manner as ecdysone. Human hormones such as estrone, estradiol, DHEA, hydrocortisone, and testosterone all effected wingbeat frequency when mosquitoes were cultured in concentrations ranging from 0-500 ppt. <br><br> This confirms the hypothesis that variations in mosquito biomarkers were capable of detecting, characterizing and helping classify extremely low levels of hormone mimics in the environment. Experimental results also illustrated the effectiveness of plant-derived terpenoid hormones for mosquito control since all terpenoids extracted from fresh plants caused increased mortality and decreased longevity in survivors. <br><br>

This experiment was designed to test the most effective measures to parthenogenically activate sea urchin eggs of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus Purpuratus). The study of parthenogenesis is the ability to artificially induce asexual reproduction in living creatures. This unique field of study is finding new applications in modern stem cell research. Parthenogenic eggs are being investigated as an alternative means to create embryos that stem cells may be harvested from.<br><br> For my experiment, I activated the eggs of Strongylocentrotus Purpuratus by exposing them to a hypertonic shock of a pure Sodium Chloride (NaCl) solution. The two experimental variables were the concentration of the hypertonic solutions (ranging from a 3.4% to a 5.3% NaCl solution) and the length of suspension in those solutions (ranging from 30 to 105 minutes). I suspended the eggs in six different solutions for six different suspension times to yield thirty-six different tests, plus an additional thirty-seventh test in which I normally fertilized eggs as an alternate control. I then counted the percentage of eggs in each test that showed signs of activation and calculated basic statistical data such as standard error of the mean.<br><br> I discovered that eggs placed in a 4.8% concentration of a NaCl solution had the highest egg activation percentage by a statistically significant margin and hence was the most successful concentration. The amount of time the eggs were suspended did not produce statistically significant results and yielded inconclusive data; however, eggs immersed from 30-45 minutes seemed to show slightly higher activation percentages.

INVESTIGATION OF BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS & RECOGNITION OF PREY FROM CHEMICAL CUES BY PHIDIPPUS AUDUX
Erin Louise Moulding
Fremont High School, Plain City UT, United States of America

Published research concerning chemosensory ability of Salticidae, particularly Phidippus, is very limited (Hoefler, et.al., 2002). This project aimed to add to the understanding of chemosensory ability in Phidippus. Most procedures were patterned after those of the Clark et. al. (2000), who tested for chemosensory ability with Habrocestum pulex (Salticidae). Three tests were conducted: (a) a Visual Cues test, (b) an Olfactory test, and (c) a Control test, feeding under normal conditions to observe and compare with the behaviors in the other tests. The Visual Cues test exposed spiders to an enclosed prey item (small cricket) surrounded by one of two substrates: 1) sand previously exposed and used by prey and 2) control sand. The results were both ambiguous and unexpected. Spiders did not respond in a predatory matter, regardless of substrate, while the prey moved. This is contradictory to previous research that indicates the visual acuity of Phidippus to detect prey. In addition, the sand exposed to prey did not increase predatory behavior. Further research is needed to determine if limitations were introduced during the Visual Cues test by the prey container, obstructing visual detection of prey. In the Olfactory test, spiders were placed in a Y-tube apparatus, with one arm serving as control and the other containing a prey item. Air flowed through both arms, exposing the spider to air-borne chemicals. The spiders showed no significant response to the Olfactory test, with very few demonstrating preference for the prey-containing arm as measured by total time spent in each tube. This indicates that the Phidippus were either unable to detect the air-borne chemical cues or did not respond in a predatory manner if they did. Finally, the control feeding test indicated that, under unrestricted conditions, spiders fed on small crickets readily. These results suggest that more research must be conducted to determine predatory mechanisms and cues for Phidippus sp.

STUDY OF THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE OF THE AXOLTL (AMBYSTOMA TIGRINUM) TO ROTATORY STIMULUS
Tania Flores Papaqui
Escuela Preparatoria Emiliano Zapata Salazar, Puebla, Puebla México.

Axolotl (Ambystoma tigrinum) has been used like a model to study vestibular system physiology. . In this work we are intending to develop a simple non-invasive and easy test of the vestibular system function in the axolotl, with the aim to, standardize a methodology which allows to study the responses of this animal to angular accelerations. These animals with no sex distinction were used in our experiments, were weighted and mesaured, and then were placed in a recording chamber which is mounted on a rotating table. Response of the animals was filmed on a video camera to record animal displacement within the recording chamber during the rotation and after rotation. In the first set of experiments animals were stimulated with a constant rotating velocity during 30s and then the table was stoped abruptly.<br><br>Results: for an N=7 animals, during the rotation 29% in the rotating direction CKW and 71% walk CCKW (against the rotating direction). During immediate postrotatory period (1-10s), 86% rotated. During late postrotatory period (10-30s), 14% walk CKW, 43% walk CCKW, 29% stay quiet do not walk, 14% various other complex movements.For an N=5 animals, during the rotation 83% walk CCKW and 17% did not walk. During immediate postrotatory period (1-10s), 83% rotated. During late postrotatory period (10-30s), 67% walk CKW, 17% various other complex movements and 17% stay quiet do not walk .The preliminary data we have obtained suggest that study of the behavioral response of the axolotl to simple rotations may allow to develop a simple behavioral non-invasive test to study the vestibular system function. El axolotl (Ambystoma tigrinum) presents a patron behavioral response to a controlated rotatory stimulus by angular accelerations and it can be standardize.<br><br>

THESE BUGS ARE CHILLIN'!
Elizabeth Marie Rezac
Avon High School, Avon, SD USA

The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanism of freezing tolerance in box elder bugs (Boisea trivittatus). I measured the survival rates of box elder bugs at different temperatures and then had their glycerol concentrations measured. It’s already known that other bugs can use glycerol to keep them from freezing in the winter. I began my research by exposing the insects to various temperatures and recording how many of them survived. After the minimum survival temperature was found, insects were ground up, filtered, and the filtrate was sent to an ethanol plant to be analyzed for glycerol content using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Box elder bugs were able to survive temperatures down to but not below –7.8ºC (18ºF). The control group of bugs kept at room temperature contained about three times more glycerol than those that were kept at –1.1ºC (30ºF). I found that box elder bugs do contain glycerol as expected but I was surprised that the colder insects did not contain a lot more glycerol since it is a type of antifreeze. Additional research is ongoing. <br><br>The benefit of this research is to learn if and how box elder bugs produce antifreeze and survive cold temperatures. Perhaps, if the bugs do contain glycerol, the gene that controls this can be taken out of those bugs and inserted into crops. As a result, the crops would not freeze in an early spring frost thus extending the growing season further into the fall for maximum yields. <br><br>

SUCCESSIONAL SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BIRDS AT BLACK MOUNTAIN PRE-FIRE TO POST-FIRE
Carey Marie Phelan
Big Sky High School, Missoula, Montana, United States

In this study, populations and species compositions of birds were monitored and compared from pre-fire to post-fire, in a Douglas Fir mixed-growth forest. This research took place at Black Mountain, in Western Montana. The purpose of this study is to create positive land management plans that incorporate the needs of Montana’s birds, after a forest fire.<br><br>In this research, birds were cataloged and monitored weekly. Four plots were created and observed 1.) unburned plot 2.) low-severity burned plot 3.) high-severity burned plot 4.) completely burned plot. On each observation date, each plot was observed for thirty minutes in a rotated order. During this time, species and species' numbers were documented.<br><br>This study established that select species of birds were more abundant in post-fire habitats, compared to unburned habitats. Birds were drawn to post-fire forests because of the wealth of food and nesting opportunities that fire creates. Some species are negatively affected by fire; their habitat, food, and protection are lost, forcing those species to move for survival. In conclusion, over time, fire helps all species by offering a more fertile habitat, as well as eliminating diseased forests and birds.<br><br>

OLFACTORY LEARNING AND BRAIN PLASTICITY IN HONEY BEES (APIS MELLIFERA) IN THE ABSENCE OF VISUAL CUES
Lesley Elizabeth Ash
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona, USA

Foraging, in honey bees (Apis mellifera), is a multi-modal task requiring acute vision and olfaction as well as complex learning, memory and ‘cognitive’ capabilities. The purpose of this research is to explore the significance of visual and olfactory cues for a foraging honey bee. The significance was determined by comparing the size of honey bee brain components that are required for these tasks, in particular the visual centers (optic lobes), the olfactory centers (antennal lobes) and centers known to underlie learning and memory (mushroom bodies). Honey bees were allowed to forage either under normal light conditions (control group) or under conditions that do not allow for color vision (monochromatic illumination; test group). The test group showed a significant increase (14%) in the relative size of the olfactory centers and a significant decrease (7.5%) in the relative size of a particular component of the optic lobes (the lobula). The anatomical results demonstrate that the brain of adult honey bees is plastic enough to accommodate drastic changes in the environment and successfully associate with reward whichever sensory cue is predominant in the environment. Additionally, it was found that the lobula may be the primary neuropil for processing chromatic information relevant for foraging and color learning. Lastly, this research demonstrated the possibility for the presence of cross-modal plasticity with in the honey bee brain.

PACIFIC MEIOFAUNA: LIFE BETWEEN SAND GRAINS
Heather Michelle Jevning
West Salem High School, Salem, Oregon, USA

Meiofauna are the secondary consumers of the oceanic beaches, and lie between the classes of microscopic organisms and those viewable to the naked human eye. Little was known about this group of organisms until the 1980's when relatively small projects were conducted in South Carolina and the Caribbean Sea. Of the research done concerning these animals, none has been centered on the rich marine habitats of the Pacific coast of the United Sates and the unique biome found on Oregon Beaches. The purpose of this project was to identify predominant species and genera of marine meiofauna and their role in the lower trophic ecosystems of North West beaches through a study of distribution and strata. Cataloging this information will supply marine researchers with a more detailed view of the small scale interactions and relationships between the lower living organisms that abide in or on the sand grains of the Pacific ocean. Finally, meiofauna lead an important role as pollution monitors. Because meiofauna are constantly in contact with both the sand and water, any disruption of ecological factors on lower trophic levels will be evident before the effects matriculate through the food web.

LIGHT REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWTH IN OREOCHROMIS AUREUS X O. NILOTICUS HYBRIDS PHASE 2
Annette Mendivil
Casa Grande Union High School, Casa Grande, AZ, USA

The growth rates of Tilapia were compared using natural light vs. 24 hours/day artificial light to understand the tolerance of Tilapia Fish to an environment of constant light. At the Gila River Tribal Farm, Tilapia, Catfish, Bass, and Freshwater Prawns are produced to market in the Phoenix and Tucson cities. <br><br> The current methods used for production by the Tribal Farm are strictly for economic reasons. If the growth rate is greatly increased for production of Tilapia, it would make economic sense to change production methods. Phase two experiment is to test Tilapia growth rate in 24 hours/day artificial light vs. Tilapia grown in Natural light. <br><br> Four tanks were used to raise 200 juvenile Tilapia Fish. A reflection screen was built for two tanks to capture all natural light from two large wall windows. A PVC pipe structure was built to support four light fixtures over the other two tanks. Each tank used was 225 gallon, with 50 fish in each. The temperature was the same for all tanks.<br><br> The Phase two experiment demonstrated that Tilapia produced in 24 hours/day artificial light gained significantly more weight (46%) then the fish produced in natural light. The information gained from Phase Two project will help the Gila River Tribal Farm staff raise Tilapia Fish in a more economically viable way to sell to Arizona grocery stores and restaurants. <br><br>

THE EVALUATION OF AQUATIC STRESS ON CONSPECIFIC BEHAVIOR AND HEMOLYMPH SERUM GLUCOSE LEVELS
Alec Lynn Thurmon
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe MO, USA

The intent of this project was to determine if aquatic stressors could trigger a response from the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish were obtained and divided into a control group and experimental groups: Ammonia and Stress urine. The control group was placed individually in observation chambers and observed for 30 min trials. They were observed for activity and movement during this period. After the trial serum blood glucose was measured. The results for both activity and glucose were normal. Four different groups of experimental ammonia and stress urine crayfish were used to determine if aquatic stress on one group could be passed on as a warning to another group of crayfish. Groups of seven crayfish were stressed with ammonia at 3ppm. They were observed for activity and movement. After the trial the serum glucose was checked. In all trials the experimental crayfish showed signs of stress activity and increased glucose levels. The ammonia was removed from the water with a commercial fish agent AmQuel, ammonia levels were 0 ppm. Next groups of seven different crayfish were placed in the stress chambers where the others had been, the AmQuel would remove ammonia not urine. The groups were observed for activity and movement for 30 min. After the trials the glucose was measured. In all trials the stress urine group showed increased activity and raised glucose levels. This research indicates that crayfish can pass on a stress warning through their urine to other crayfish in their area.

WHERE HAVE ALL THE BUGS GONE?
Raynebeaux Donavon Kelly
Fort Wingate High School, Fort Wingate, New Mexico, USA

The purpose of this project was to study the effects of an herbicide upon a riparian zone’s insect species diversity and population. The effects were then later examined by means of collection and observation. The factors included the following: the selection of insects, the areas from which the insects were collected and the type of weather or season during which the insects were gathered. Observations and data were recorded during the collection. The experiment would show whether or not the herbicide "Imazypir", or arsenal, affected the riparian area’s insect diversity and population. Two sites were established for observation, one in a native willow area which may include other native plants, the other in an invasive salt cedar area, both were in the same riparian zone. A third site was established in an entirely different riparian zone in which salt cedar and/or another invasive plant species were not a problem. This third site served as the control site. At these sites, data and insects were collected for observation. The data collected included a square foot perimeter environment description. The insects were then grouped by appearance and later counted. Then the numbers of insects were charted. When the observation and charts were complete, comparison began. The sites compared were the first and second sites to the third control site. With an overview of the data, the hypothesis stated was supported.

TEMPERATURE-INDUCED BLEACHING IN THE TROPICAL SEA ANEMONE AIPTASIA PULCHELLA
Hillary Ann Futch
Paxon School for Advanced Studies, Jacksonville Fl, USA

This experiment, the fifth study in a series designed to investigate species adaption to their environments, explores the ability of species to adapt to extreme changes such as those brought about by global warming. <br><br> <br><br>Aiptasia pulchella is a tropical sea anemone that typically lives among coral along the coast. It, like the coral it lives around, has been greatly affected by the phenomenon of global warming. The increase in surface temperature has caused an increase in oceanic temperatures as well as ground temperature, and this increase in water temperature could prove deadly to the species in our oceans. <br><br> <br><br>Coral reefs around the world have been noted to be undergoing "bleaching”, the expulsion of symbiotic algae, as a sign of stress. This experiment was designed to investigate the direct effect that global warming itself has on the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella. <br><br> <br><br>Anemones in this experiment were exposed to temperature increases and specific gravity decreases in order to simulate the effects of global warming and the melting of polar ice caps. It was found that coral bleaching did occur when the effects of global warming were mimicked. <br><br> <br><br>These data suggest that as global temperature increases over time, the effect that it has on the anemones may increase, ultimately resulting in death and the possible extinction of the species. <br><br> <br><br>The effects that are evident in this species are a primary indicator of the magnified effects it may have on larger oceanic environments.

PORIFERA...AN ALTERNATIVE TO REDUCE SEA WATER CONTAMINATION.
Luisa Fernanda Angel Buitrago
Eloisa Pascual High Shool, Caguas PR 

This investigation is to find out if sponges can be an alternative to reduce the contamination of sea water in Puerto Rico. The hypothesis established that this is possible because of the eating habits of sponges. To do the investigation three fish tanks were used and labeled as tank A, B and C. Each tank contained 2,000 mL of sea water and air spouts for each one of them. The PH level, conductivity and temperature were measured. A sample of 0.2 mL of Enterococcus bacteria was added to each tank. The microbial density was measured in each tank. Then two sponges were placed in each of tanks A and B. Tank C was the control one. The microbial density was then measured in three concecutive days. Results showed that in tanks A and B there was a significant reduction in the microbial density while in tank C there was an increase followed by a small reduction in it. The experimention was repeated in the same way to corroborate the results. But now the sample of Enterococcus used was 0.5 mL. The results obtained were the same as before. These results demostrated that the sponges can be a good alternative to reduce contamination of sea water. This proved hypothesis to be accepted.

A NEW OECANTHUS FROM PUERTO RICO: BEHAVIOR,MORPHOLOGY, ECOLOGY, AND GEOGRAPHYCAL DISTRIBUTION, SPECTROGRAPHY AND MUSICAL CHIRPING STUDY.
Johiry Huertas
Jose Santos Alegría Dorado Puerto Rico

The Muntingia calabura tree is known in Puerto Rico as the snoring tree because of stereophonic sounds that comes from it. The purpose of this investigation was to identify the source and musical scale of this sound. It was found that the sound came from an arboreal cricket that lives in it. This study described the song, morphology, behavior, ecological and geographical distribution of the Oecanthus, an arboreal cricket that is being reported for the first time in Puerto Rico. The Hertz frequency and the musical scale were used to identify the cricket through its song. The stereophonic sound emitted by the puertorrican Oecanthus was analyzed using the software sound forge (spectrogram) Xp 2002. This sound was filtered and analyzed using a spectrometer and it was compared with other Oecanthus’ song from North America (argentinus, fultony, and others). The spectrogram of the puertorrican Oecanthus’ song has a frequency of 2,200 Hertz, which is different from all other Oecanthus. The Oecanthus song was analyzed using the musical scale and it was found to be in Do sustained. That sound came from the friction of the wings of the Oecanthus male. In the mating ritual the male raised its fore wings exposing the metanotal gland, the female was on its back and then it fed from this gland. The male died on the following day. The influence of the temperature and light has been observed in the stereophonic sound of this cricket. The Muntingia calabura is the habitat of the puertorrican Oecanthus.

THE EFFECT OF NONYLPHENOL, AN ENDOCRINE MIMICKER, ON DAPHNIA MAGNA REPRODUCTION
Matthew Brian Hammitt
Cloquet High School, Cloquet, MN, U.S.

Endocrine mimicking chemicals affect the endocrine systems of organisms. Two chemicals thought to be endocrine disrupters are nonylphenol and octylphenol, which are commonly found in home cleaning products as surfactants. Daphnia magna were exposed to nonylphenol to test its effects on their reproduction, specifically, their number of offspring, their sex ratios at birth, and later, their method of reproduction. After determining the lethal dose, Daphnia were exposed to various concentrations. Results showed progressively fewer offspring produced, a progressively greater proportion of males at birth, and a change from asexual to sexual reproduction. An ANOVA analysis of the data revealed a p value p <.01 in one case and .02 in another, indicating that nonylphenol affects the reproduction of Daphnia magna. The results also demonstrate an evolutionary response supporting the Red Queen hypothesis. Further tests are necessary to determine if the concentration in nature is disruptive to the Daphnia magna.

THE EFFECTS OF HEREDITY ON PRESENT FINGERPRINT PATTERNS
Kendra Lee Potasiewicz
Poland Central School, Poland NY, United States of America

This study has been designed to see if heredity will play a role in a person's present fingerprint patterns. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant correlation between parents and offspring's present patterns, as well as a sibling to sibling correlation. <br><br> Proper equipment will be obtained for taking fingerprints from the NY State Police barracks in Oneida, NY. This equipment will be used to take the fingerprints of 20 different families. The prints will then be analyzed to see which basic patterns they possess. The patterns will be recorded on a family record sheet that was developed.<br><br> In analyzing the fingerprints, it was found that there was a direct correlation between the patterns on the same fingers of the hands (for example right thumb to right thumb) between parents and offspring, and siblings also. It was found that a child tended to take after one specific parent, rather than a combination of each. When the same type of pattern occurred on the same finger of both parents, the offspring tended to generally inherit that pattern on that finger.<br><br> After collecting and analyzing the data, it was found that heredity tended to play a role in a person's fingerprint patterns. There appeared to be a direct correlation between the patterns on the same fingers of the hands between parents and offspring, and also between siblings. In this study, offspring tended to take after one of their parents when it came to present patterns, rather than a combination of each.

<br><br> The purpose of my project is to draw a genetic correlation between Drosophila Melanogaster (fruit fly) and Danio Rerio (zebra fish). I hope to achieve such through comparing and contrasting genotypic and phenotypic changes within both species.<br><br><br> I previously conducted an analysis on Drosophila for the effects of heat shock and genetic expression. The previously collected data was used for a comparison to correlate between invertebrates and vertebrates.<br><br><br> I separated 3 male and female Zebra Danio and placed them into the uncovered aquarium, labeled “Aqua 1". Next I separated 3 more males and females and placed them into the covered aquarium labeled “Aqua 2”. A control aquarium was set up for comparing and contrasting. Next I inserted 3u/ mL of Geldanamycin into the unfiltered aquariums. Once the Danio had been exposed for 30 minutes, I placed them into their temperatures for one week. The testing temperatures where a high of 39* Celsius and a low of 29* Celsius. The control aquarium was kept at 34* Celsius.Once time expired I removed the Danio from the temperatures and placed them into a regulated aquarium. I watched the Danio for reproduction. I removed the adult Danio and left the embryos. I analyzed the F1 and F2 Danio under the stereomicroscope for signs of genetic expression. <br><br> <br><br> In the end, I found my hypothesis to be correct. Heat Shock Protein 90 suggested that a genetic link exists between Drosophila Melanogasters and Danio Rerio.

THE EFFECTS OF SELECTED CHELATORS ON THE ABILITY OF CELLULAR MODELS TO RECOVER FROM LEAD EXPOSURE
Kristen Elaine Fenska
Miami High School, Miami, Oklahoma

This investigation evaluated the ability of chelators to enhance the recovery of cellular models from lead toxicity. Models were selected to represent vital cellular processes and included: cell regeneration in Lumbriculus variegatus; Catalase function; mitochondrial function evaluated through Cytochrome c Oxidase activity; microglial cell and human glioma cell viability. Models were stressed with lead acetate solutions (1.25 ppb to 20 ppb or 5 µM to 40 µM) and treated with chelators (DMSA, DMPS, EDTA, and EDTA plus BAL) to determine recovery efficiency. It was hypothesized that the cellular models would show recovery from lead toxicity when treated with chelators. Cell regeneration recovery occurred in the DMPS treatment, but did not occur in EDTA, EDTA plus BAL, and DMSA treated worms (ANOVA p=0.0001). Lead exposed Catalase placed in EDTA regained some function lost by heavy metal exposure, while the other chelators showed limited ability to protect the enzyme (ANOVA p=0.0001). Chelators showed varied abilities to restore the function of Cytochrome c Oxidase (ANOVA p=0.0001). The microglia cells showed recovery with a greater viablilty when treated with DMPS and with EDTA; however, little recovery was shown in DMSA and in EDTA plus BAL treatments (ANOVA p=0.0001). The glioma cells showed the DMPS treatment to help lead exposed cells maintain a viability approaching that of the control; however, showed little recovery in DMSA, EDTA, and EDTA plus BAL (ANOVA p=0.0001).

THE EFFECTS OF A SEROTONERGIC SYSTEM ALTERED BY PCPA ON BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Clay Ashby Turner
Lafayette High School, Lexington Kentucky, United States

Drosophila is a simple model system that provides an advantage over other vertebrates to modify genetically for electrophysiological studies on identifiable cells. In this organism the sensory-CNS-motor circuit is modulated by serotonin (5-HT) in larvae which gives one insight that this neuromodulator is playing a role in central neuronal circuits. The role of 5-HT in the behavior and development in Drosophila melanogaster is being studied. pCPA (para-chlorophenylalanine) prevents the synthesis of 5-HT by blocking the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. Animal body length at second and third instar, development time to pupation, immunocytochemistry staining of 5-HT in the third instar larvae brain, and behavior tests were studied. The larval development is slowed and the body length is decreased by pCPA. Locomotive behavior and mouth hook movements were also reduced in the third instar larvae that were fed pCPA since the first instar. Antibody staining of the third instar larvae brain for 5-HT shows a reduction in intensity of 5-HT in animals fed pCPA. This study shows that pCPA reduces 5-HT production which also correlates with reduced and retarded larval development and altered behavior.

THE EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SWEETENERS ON D. MELANOGASTER.
Caroline Hope Schaer
Cheltenham High School, Wyncote, Pennsylvania, United States of America

Since the discovery of the first artificial sweetener in 1879, these sweeteners have caused celebration and controversy. Overwhelmingly popular in reduced-calorie foods, some artificial sweeteners have been blamed for causing varying side affects in their users. The purpose of this experiment was to determine which sweetener, artificial or natural, and at what concentration level, causes the greatest variation in the reproduction of Drosophila melanogaster, measured by a change in population and mutations among offspring. It was hypothesized that Sweet 'N Low, at its lethal concentration, would cause the greatest change in the offspring.<br><br> A saturation level of the sweeteners in water was used to determine a concentration for stock solutions. Four sweeteners were used: Sweet 'N Low, Equal, Splenda, and sucrose. The LC50 was determined by leaving 10 flies in a vial for 2 days with 2.65g Formula 4-24 fly food and 14mL of the determined stock solutions(15g:50mL-sweetener:water). Serial dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 were tested to determine the LC50. Adult flies, unexposed to any sweetener, were removed to ensure virginity. The new flies were separated by sex and 5 males and 5 females were placed into each vial. After 3 days, the adult flies were discarded. The larvae were left to mature. After 11 days, the new adult flies were observed and counted. It was observed that Sweet ‘N Low caused the greatest population decrease(100% less than the control), Splenda caused the greatest population increase(462.06% greater than the control)and Equal caused the most mutations(47.6% of the population).

THE EFFECT OF ADDED SUBSTRATE ON STRESS REDUCTION AND VIRAL SUSCEPTIBILITY IN LITOPENAEUS VANNA MEI
Clifford Allen Kapono
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, Hawaii USA

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effect of added substrate on stress levels and viral infection susceptibility on Litopenaeus vannamei. <br><br> An initial experiment was run to test the effectiveness of plastic substrate and oyster shells on growth rate and survival of L. vannamei. Each system was stocked initially at 800 shrimp per square meter with 15-day-old post larval shrimp. System was then maintained and allowed to run for approximately 13 weeks. <br><br> The control system yielded shrimp at an average weight of 0.37 grams. The system with plastic substrate yielded shrimp at the highest average weight of 0.44 grams. The system with oyster shell substrate yielded the lowest average growth rates of 0.25 grams. <br><br> The control system yielded the lowest shrimp average survival rates of 7%. The system with plastic substrate yielded shrimp average survival rates of 11%. Finally oyster shell substrate systems yielded the highest average survival rate of 21%. <br><br> The control system yielded the lowest total biomass per system with 2.76 grams of shrimp. The plastic substrate yielded the middle rage of total biomass with 4.00 grams of shrimp. The oyster shell system yielded the highest total biomass per system with 5.66 grams of shrimp. <br><br> DNA samples were also collected from L. vannamei originating from China, Indonesia, India, and Thailand. The Polymerase chain reaction indicated that there was a presence of White Spot syndrome virus in samples from Thailand, Indonesia, and India at the 100 base pair. <br><br>

BASELINE CHARACTERIZATION OF A PRISTINE FRINGING CORAL REEF
Zaki D. Moustafa
Dreyfoos School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, FL, United States

Coral reefs are highly sensitive and respond more quickly than any other ecosystem to environmental changes, and are considered an early warning system for the oceans health. Presently, the impact and rate of change of manmade influences on a pristine fringing coral reef and its inhabitants are not well documented. A major goal of this study was to establish baseline conditions for an isolated pristine fringing coral reef community, located in the Northern Red Sea (29° 32’N & 32° 24’E). Due to its remote desert location, the reef has remained pristine. However, completion of a new major shipping port, 10 km north, is a dire concern to its continued health. <br><br>Underwater digital photography and videos were used to survey and document the health of the reef community. Percent area of coral coverage was calculated to identify dominant species. Comparative analysis indicated that performing a total area analysis of photographs provided the most accurate assessment, while a spatial random count method, in most cases, is a reasonable estimator. Results indicated that Finger, Staghorn, Anemone, and Neptheidae corals comprised 90% of the corals observed. Approximately 15% (mainly Staghorn) were broken and dead (most likely a result of bleaching). <br><br>This reef, containing extensive live hard and soft coral, can be classified as a healthy pristine reef, although sea urchin population counts were dense enough to be of concern (pollution indicator). Annual visits to the reef are planned for at least three years to resurvey the reef and compare results to this baseline study. <br><br>

DECLINE IN BLUE JAY POPULATION IN CHURCHVILLE, PA DUE TO WEST NILE VIRUS
Molly K. Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, Pennsylvania, United States of America 

The purpose of this research project was to study the Cyanocitta cristata population in Churchville, PA and whether it was declining because of West Nile Virus (WNV). I compiled data from different sources to create graphs, from which I was able to conclude whether the Blue Jay population was rising or falling. I compared the number of birds reported with WNV with trends in Blue Jay population. My hypothesis was the Cyanocitta cristata population was declining because of West Nile Virus. As I progressed, I discovered more causal factors that needed further exploration. My goal was to eliminate all of the possible factors to find the factor that truly affected the population. My project included gathering data from various sources, compiling graphs, studying background, and analyzing overall results. I gathered data from Churchville Nature Center (CNC), the National Audubon website, and other sources. The CNC data was a weekly bird count of the local ecosystem in Churchville over the last four years. The data from the Audubon Society concerned the numbers of birds seen once annually at the Christmas Bird Count, done for over a century. It was important to study the Blue Jay habits to better understand how the factors affect that particular bird, so I compiled a Bird Biography. I got information on the disease from USGS, the CDC and other sources. The PA WNV website contained the number of positive avian cases annually in Bucks County. The Bucks Health Department answered specific WNV questions. My findings support my hypothesis that Cyanocitta cristata population is declining in Churchville and its cause is West Nile Virus. My data predicts that by the year 2007, there will be no Blue Jays sighted in Churchville, yielding significant impact on the ecosystem. Because of the relative newness of the disease in the U.S. and importance of its impact on the species, this topic requires further study. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF POLYPHENOLS ON BONE DEVELOPMENT
Angie Lynnae Niemann
Valley High School, Hoople ND, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of polyphenols on bone development in zebrafish. One hundred juvenile zebrafish were tested. Subjects were fed different concentrations of polyphenols (found in green tea) mixed with their fish food for two weeks. Four groups of 25 fish were fed one of the following concentrations of polyphenols: 0%, 50%, 100% and 150%. Water temperature (27 degrees C), tank size (25 fish per five-gallon aquarium), pump filtration, amount of food, feeding times and dechlorinated tap water were constant for all tanks. Ten percent of the water was changed weekly. Tissue was analyzed by staining cartilage blue and bone red. Microscopic digital images were taken, backgrounds were removed, and red and blue pixels were shown. Ten images per experimental group (40 total) were analyzed using Dr. Steve Lindaas' software, IDL, which calculated the amount of red and blue pixels, indicating bone development. Data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) and a Duncan's test. Conclusion: The diet treatment significantly affected the degree of calcification of the zebrafish larvae. A dose of 100 or 150% polyphenols was necessary to produce an effect. The 50% dose had no significance, not being statistically different from the control.

DEVELOPING AN EXPERIMENTAL METHOD TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A NON-RANDOM PREFERENCE FOR EDGE HABITAT BY THE TIMBER RATTLESNAKES (CROTALUS HORRIDUS) AT TYSON RESEARCH CENTER
Ryan Matthew Turnquist
Rockwood Summit High School, Fenton MO, USA

With the ever-increasing habitat fragmentation, the importance of understanding and determining the habitat selection of animal populations increases. Alterations and destruction of the environment creates habitat ecotones, an ecotone being defined as the zone of transition between two adjacent ecosystems. The term edge effect is used to describe the tendency of increased population density and species richness at the ecotone. A group of timber rattlesnakes in Tyson Research Center that were previously implanted with radio transmitters was used for this study. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to develop and test a far more accurate method to determine the threshold distances of ecotones and (2) investigate the extent of the non-random edge preference of the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) at Tyson Research Center. It is hypothesized that the threshold distances can be determine by the change in thermal gradient and the timber rattlesnake non-randomly prefer edge habitat. The ecotone may be quantified as the distance until a variable (i.e. temperature) begins to level off; however, in many studies, the threshold distance was arbitrarily determined. Results show a major variation in thermal distance for different edge types. The GPS locations from one active season telemetry data for twelve timber rattlesnakes was used to determine if there is a non-random preference for edge habitat. Results show a significant preference for ecotone habitat by the timber rattlesnake. From this study, the natural history of the timber rattlesnake will gain much needed information for the conservation of this important snake specie.

A STUDY OF THE CROSSES OF GAL4/UAS-EKO AND GAL4/UAS-DORK IN D. MELANOGASTER.
Zeb Ralph Zacharias, Kayla Ann Delaney
Perham High School, Perham, Minnesota, United States

The Gal4/UAS system is an experiment that deals with D. melanogaster and the nervous system and how the Gal4 protein seeks out UAS promoter sites on DNA. In this project, three genetically engineered flies are used: Ddc-Gal4, UAS-EKO and UAS-dORK. Ddc-Gal4 causes the Gal4 protein to be created whenever dopamine is created. UAS-EKO causes the EKO protein to be created whenever the UAS promoter site is activated. UAS-dORK causes the dORK protein to be created when the UAS promoter site is activated. EKO and dORK are similar in the way they create extra potassium channels, however, dORK keeps these channels open. When the progeny of either of the two crosses create dopamine, the Gal4 protein is created and will activate UAS sites. This causes the EKO or dORK protein to be created depending on the cross. The purpose of this experiment is to study the crosses of Gal4/UAS-EKO and Gal4/UAS-dORK. It was hypothesized that the progeny would exhibit impaired motor functions and would act unstably. The progeny were observed and data was recorded to determine the quality of motor function in comparison to parent and wild type flies. The data collected supports the hypothesis, indicating that the progeny of Gal4/UAS-EKO have impaired motor function and in tests performed below that of the parent and wild type. These results express that the Gal4 protein indeed activates UAS promoter sites on the DNA molecule and suggests further research of the Gal4/UAS system.

THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE DAILY FOOD INTAKE OF A WILD WHITE-HEADED LANGUR
Yue Du, Boqin Zhang 
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University,No.5 High School,Beijing,China

The white-headed langur(Presbytis leucocephalus Tan)is under the state's highest protection level, and one of 25 most endangered primates worldwide. As one of its essential biological features, the daily food intake will provide necessary information for estimating the environmental carrying capacity and the decision about the minimum reserve area. Because the current method for calculating primates' daily food intake in captivity is not suitable for wild ones, a method specific for wild white-headed langur is required.<br><br> In this study, a method is developed for calculating the daily food intake of a wild langur based on field observation, filming and analysis by computer. The method "Velocity-Time" discussed in the research paper requires two parameters regarding a langur's feeding behaviors: its daily feeding time (T) in seconds, and velocity (V) in grams per second. Then its daily food food intake (E) can be calculated through the formula: E=V*T. T can be obtained from field observation, and V can be obtained from filming, computer analysis,plant collection and weighing. It is the first computer analysis of the white-headed langur's feeding habits.<br><br> The winter intake of male and female white-headed langur was calculated, with the results of 643.4 plus or minus 93.4g and 626.4 plus or minus 79.9g, respectively. Compared with those in captivity during the same season, the method proves reasonable. A discussion concerns the variable aspects that could have effects on the calculating result; also discussed is the relative conservation. With further improvement, this method might be applied to different populations of white-headed langur, even to other wild langur.<br><br>

CHICK CALLS: ENGINEERING A DEVICE PROGRAMMED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC VOCALIZATIONS OF YOUNG, FEMAL
Laura Michelle Fisher, Amber Nichole Shinsel
Westview High School, Portland, Oregon, United States

Previous research has shown that chickens produce unique calls under different conditions. This project examined the feasibility of programming a device that could recognize specific calls. Vocalizations were collected from a variety of stimuli: isolation, hunger, being given food, thirst, being given water, fear, irritation, and control. Tests were done independently and repeatedly on two separate groups of two and three pullets housed at separate locations.<br><br>Data was analyzed under different parameters, including amplitude, wave form, spectrogram, frequency, and tonal intervals. Unique vocalizations were produced in the isolation, hunger, fear, and irritation tests. A device was then built using a PIC Processor and programmed to identify sounds based on tonal intervals, timing, amplitude, and tonal pitches. <br><br>This sound-recognition instrument could be used to evaluate the needs or general welfare of pullets up to the age of four months and could be adapted for use with older chickens of either sex. This device could be used to measure the well-being of chickens in commercial, agricultural settings. Also, with further research, it could be programmed to recognize the calls of other animals.

A STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT WAVELENGTH ON THE REPRODUCTIVE RATE OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Amber Marie Keefer, Lauren Nichole Jones
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States

The Drosophila melanogaster is used frequently in genetic research because of its rapid maturation and large reproduction rates. Although there are several mutations, red-eye or wild-type fruit flies were used for this project, as they are most common in nature and in laboratories. The purpose of this project was to determine if the wavelength of light affects reproduction of Drosophila since it is necessary for researchers to obtain results quickly and have the largest test sample possible.<br><br> To complete this project, fruit flies were obtained, sexed, and then placed into vials. Each vial contained six breeding pairs. The vials were labeled accordingly and placed into plastic containers wrapped with transparent, red, blue, and yellow polypropylene. A control group was placed into a container left unwrapped. The flies reproduced, and the number of live offspring was recorded.<br><br> Flies in the container with red polypropylene had the largest reproduction rate, followed by the control group, blue, transparent, and yellow groups.<br><br>

POTENTIAL FOR VERTICAL TRANSMISSION OF WEST NILE VIRUS AND WESTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS IN CULEX TARSALIS AND CULEX QUINQUEFASCIATUS
Priscilla Yvette Mendoza, Gabriel Joel Mendoza
Americas High School, El Paso, TX, USA

The development of a complete and accurate picture of mosquito species and mosquito disease distribution surveys has become a fundamental method for providing health authorities with critical information needed to prevent and control disease outbreaks in animal and human populations. The main vectors of West Nile Virus and Western Equine Encephalitis are Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus, which reside naturally in the El Paso area. Recently, transovarial transmission of these diseases has occurred in isolated locations around the world where infected vector populations have reached elevated levels. The scope of this project is to find the prevalence or potential of transovarial transmission within El Paso and surrounding areas, and create a Database of mosquito species and disease distribution and density in the El Paso area. In order to do so, 7000+ mosquito samples and water samples containing mosquito larvae were obtained from selected sites from the region surveyed. Mosquitoes were sampled into pools and statistical analyses were performed. <br><br> Culex quinquefasciatus had the highest species distribution with 69%. Utilizing baseline data obtained, Deterministic Models of Western Equine Encephalitis and West Nile Virus were developed. Transovarial transmission is not currently prevalent within the region surveyed, 0.00%; however, based on the Deterministic Models of infection rates and female vector rates in El Paso, the number of infected female vectors in El Paso will reach the necessary levels for transovarial transmission to be prevalent for Western Equine Encephalitis before the year 2043.3 and before the year 2030 for West Nile Virus. <br><br>

METHODS OF DETERRING SHARKS IN BOTH INVASIVE AND NONINVASIVE SITUATIONS
Kaitlin Maria Luther, Alana Yurkanin
H.P. Baldwin High School, Wailuku Hawaii, USA

The purpose of this project was to find methods of deterring sharks in both invasive and noninvasive situations in order to prevent a shark attack in the ocean. For methods of deterring sharks in non invasive situations, sounds altered to match characteristics of effective sounds from the past two years of work on this project were used. For invasive situations, jets of air were released to deter sharks immediately, despite the presence of food. The hypothesis predicted that both methods would prove effective in deterring sharks.<br><br> After extensive research, the results indicated that in non invasive situations, computer enhanced bottlenose dolphin sounds were effective. More specifically, Bottlenose dolphin sounds lowered in frequency worked most efficiently. One explanation is that in the first year of research, dolphin sounds deterred sharks and the second year, lower frequencies deterred sharks. By combining the two into one ‘super’ sound, an even more dramatic effect occurred. As Bottlenose dolphins are larger and kill more sharks than the smaller Spinner dolphins, their sounds proved more effective. <br><br> In invasive situations, a jet of air was released in the shark’s direction as it approached food. This test proved highly effective seeing as sharks left immediately despite wanting the fish. The ability to deter sharks instantly is essential, especially if it’s approaching what it sees as a meal.<br><br> By utilizing these results it’s possible to keep sharks away and if sharks are already present, get them to go away without harming them or any other marine life.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF VINAGER AS AN INSECTICIDE ON FIRE ANTS (SOLENOPSIS RICHTERI)
Nabila Maher Vallés, Melizabeth Acevedo, Rudelis Alvarado
Escuela Superior Nueva con Departamento Vocacional, Naranjito, PR

The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate that the larger the amount of vinegar applied directly to fire ants in an ant hill it will most probably eliminate a 100% of them. Four plastic containers were used with seven ounces of dirt with fire ants in each one. Ten drops of vinegar were added to container #1, 20 drops of vinegar to container #2, 30 drops to container #3 and 40 drops to container #4. These amounts of vinegar were added to each container every day during two consecutive weeks. During the investigation it was observed that all ants in container #3 died after 12 days of treatment and the ants in container #4 died 7 days after treatment. The ants in container #1 and #2, to which a lesser amount of vinegar were added did not die. At the end of the investigation the data was analyzed and it was demonstrated that a larger amount of vinegar eliminated a 100% of the ants. It was thus proved that vinegar is effective, economic and less toxic, than other insecticides, to eliminate fire ants. This conclusion proved the hypothesis to be accepted.<br><br>

The purpose of our investigation was to determine whether or not electromagnetic fields had an effect on the growth and development of a Gallus domesticus embryo. We hypothesized that the electromagnetic field would affect the growth and development of a Gallus domesticus embryo. <br><br> In our investigation the Gallus domesticus eggs were divided into two groups of six. We exposed the experimental group of Gallus domecticus eggs to an electromagnetic field that measured 2.6 x 10-4 Tesla for five days. The control group of six Gallus domesticus was not exposed to an electromagnetic field.<br><br> We concluded that there was no significant evidence indicating that the electromagnetic field caused growth or developmental abnormalities in the developing embryos. In the experimental group the hatch rate was 83.3%. In the control group, the hatch rate was also 83.3%. There were no significant differences in birth weight and hatching time fell within the normal range. <br><br><br>

USING WING CHARACTERISTICS OF DROSOPHILA TO MAP EVOLUTIONARY MODES AND PATTERNS
Marissa Fawn Goldblatt, Karthik Vellore Sabapathy
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy, Plainview, New York, U.S.

In order to better understand the inner workings of evolution as a whole, a parallel study was performed to observe both evolutionary mode and patterns in Drosophila. The effects of wing patterns and the evolution of them was the main focus of this study.<br><br>We began by determining whether behaviors related to wing melanin spots evolved analogous to the wing spots themselves. The male courtship behaviors of D. eugracilis, D. biarmipes, D. pulchrella, D. lutescens, and D. elegans were recorded and analyzed using a Panasonic PV-GS200 Mini DV Camcorder. Many of these displays show off the wing spot, a trait that seems to have no evolutionary pattern. The makeup of the displays of each species was obtained by manually tallying all steps observed on the digital tape. Using Nei’s genetic distance equation to form an evolutionary tree, it was found that rather than being sporadic, most courtship behavior followed the evolutionary tree of Kopp and True (2002).<br><br>Next we explored whether the mode of evolution, genetic drift or natural selection, could be determined if certain species of Drosophila were geographically isolated. Determining wing luminosity, primarily from the presence of melanin spots, data from 25 Hawaiian species was analyzed using the Ward Cluster Method. These clusters were then used to formulate a second phylogenic tree, which proved that the evolution of Drosophila on the Hawaiian Islands occurs due to genetic drift, corroborating the Carson and Templeton Founder Flush model theory.<br><br>

This project concerns with the examination of the life-cycle of the giant moths, Attacus atlas L., one of the harmful pests in agriculture and to search for the possible alternatives to utilize them for making fiber thread. By feeding the giant moths with different leaves, namely orange, climbing ilang-ilang, white mulberry, guava and red sentol leaves, a series of experiments were conducted to observe the effects on growth rates of giant moths, the quality in length, endurance and elasticity of silk threads produced by the worms and the ease of those attained threads to be used as woven into silk clothes. It was disclosed that the worms fed with red sentol leaves revealed the fastest growth rate and produced the highest number of eggs, the biggest worms, the biggest cocoons, the longest silk thread and the largest full-grown butterflies. In addition, the worms fed with red sentol leaves produced the best quality silk thread: shiniest, longest, most endurable and elastic. The silk thread obtained was also found to be of almost the same quality as that derived by silk worms. The outcome of this work is very promising and should be paid more attention to further study for textile industrial application.<br><br>

DOES THE INTRAMAMMARY TEAT SEALANT ORBESEAL HELP PREVENT NEW INTRAMAMMARY INFECTION OF DAIRY COWS DURING THE DRY PERIOD, RESULTING IN LOWER SOMATIC CELL COUNTS IN THE...
Joy L. Burnham
Okeechobee Freshman Campus, Okeechobee, Florida, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if the teat sealant Orbeseal reduced new infection during the dry period of dairy cattle, resulting in lower somatic cell count and better quality milk. I performed this experiment because Orbeseal is a new product that has not been tested in a climate like Florida’s. I hypothesized that cows receiving Orbeseal, along with a dry cow antibiotic, would have the greatest reduction of somatic cell count.<br><br> To test my hypothesis, 104 cows to be dried off were randomly put into groups and treated. Group One received Orbeseal, Group Two received Orbeseal and CEFA Dri, and Group Three received CEFA- Dri. This group was observed as the control group because CEFA- Dri is the treatment normally administered at our dairy. Cows were sampled three times: once at dry off before treatment, once at 3 to 13 DIM (days in milk), and once 25 to 35 DIM. <br><br> To determine which group had the greatest reduction of somatic cell count, I performed a Z-test to exclude outliers. I completed a percent change calculation to determine which group had a larger decrease. I also performed a T-test to determine if my results were statistically significant, and they were found not to be. Another analysis was performed using cows with cell counts at or below average. This analysis showed that no cows in Group Two had an increase over the target cell count.<br><br> My hypothesis was proven correct through two analyses and statistically insignificant by another.

EFFECT OF EMBRYO CULTURE IN THE PRESENCE OF IGF-1 ON POST-TRANSFER SURVIVAL OF IN VITRO PRODUCED BOVINE EMBRYOS - A THREE YEAR STUDY
Matthew Steven Walker
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, Florida, USA

This experiment was to evaluate the effect of embryos in the presence of IGF-1 on post-transfer survival of in vitro produced bovine embryos. Embryos were harvested using the in vitro fertilization method, and later transferred into synchronized recipient cows (n = 45) on day eight of the embryos maturation process. <br><br> In this procedure the role that I played consisted of, extracting the oocytes from slaughter house ovaries. I assisted in the process of checking for the presence, or absence of a corpus luteum, and also assisted in preparation of the embryos for transfer. In addition I administered the epidurals to prepare the recipient animal for the upcoming transfer.<br><br> The IGF-1 did have an effect on the post-transfer survival of in vitro produced bovine embryos as compared to the control. The IVF embryo transfer results for days twenty-seven, to twenty-eight, post breeding shows that the KSOM-BE2 supplemented with IGF-1 into the culture media had 12% more conceptions than that of the KSOM-BE2 supplemented with a similar volume of 0.1 M acetic acid (control). The IVF embryo transfer results for days forty-two, to forty-nine post breeding shows that the KSOM-BE2 supplemented with IGF-1 has yet again shown that it gives greater conception rates, this time having a 10% increase. <br><br><br><br><br>

Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs FL, USA

The venomous snakes of the genus Bothrops represent a large and diverse group of deadly snakes primarily restricted to South America. Relationships among species in Bothrops are unknown, hindering the production of specialized and effective antivenin. DNA sequence analysis will determine whether or not Bothrops descends from a single common ancestor, and how this large and diverse genus may be subdivided into multiple genera.<br><br> DNA was extracted from liver or skin tissue samples of multiple individuals from each species. Cytochrome-b fragments of mitochondrial DNA were separately amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with Gludg and ATRCB3 primers. PCR products were examined through electrophoresis. Successful products were excised from the agarose gel and successively cleaned. The purified DNA product was directly sequenced in the forward and reverse directions. Sequence chromatographs were manually edited and aligned twice. Statistical analyses were made and a phylogeny was built.<br><br> The results suggest that Bothrops is not an exclusive monophyletic group because the genus Bothriopsis is phylogenetically nested within the genus Bothrops. Taxonomic revision is needed in order to correct this paraphyly. <br><br>Five distinct natural groupings were evident that provide a potential path for taxonomic revision of Bothrops into five separate genera. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CELLULAR TELEPHONE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF DEVELOPING DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Victoria Amanda Wheeler
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS, U.S.A.

There has been much controversy and fear over whether or not cellular telephones cause biological and neurological damage to humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cellular telephone electromagnetic radiation on the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster during the pupae and larvae stages of development. Drosophila melanogaster was chosen because it is frequently used as a model for neurological studies and experimentation. If Drosophila was significantly harmed by the electromagnetic radiation then the assumption can be made that humans may also be harmed. The parameter used to evaluate its effect on the nervous system was the behavior. Drosophila melanogaster during the pupae and larvae stages was exposed to the frequency of 823 mhz,which is the same frequency used for cellular telephones. The control was exposed to no radiation. After exposure, the behavior of each fly in every group tested was rated and recorded using a scale of zero to seven. <br><br>After all data was documented, ANOVA was used to evaluate the three groups. I found that there was no statistically significant difference between the data groups. Therefore, the cellular telephone electromagnetic radiation had no effect on the behavior of developing Drosophila.

THE EFFECTS OF HEADACHE SUPPRESSANTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE PILL BUG
Darius Trevor Love
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment was to find out which headache suppressant (Bayer, Aspirin, Advil, or Tylenol) would have the greatest effect on the nervous system of the pill bug. First, I gathered pill bugs and kept them in their moist dark habitats. Next, I ground all headache suppressants into a fine powder separately. 500 milliliters of water were mixed thoroughly with 500 milligrams of each suppressant in their own individual containers. Then, carrots were cut into 1 inch long and wide cylindrical shapes. The headache suppression solution was injected into the carrots. This was done weekly for four weeks. Two strength solutions were used. The pill bugs were placed into their new habitats and their inhabitant counts were monitored each day and recorded. At the end of one month, I recorded which pain reliever elimminated the most pill bugs. I discovered that Advil was the most harmful pain reliever, Bayer Aspirin was second, and Tylenol was the least harmful of all. Therefore, my project proved that all headache suppressants do have an effect on the pill bug's nervous system, and the hypothesis stating that Advil medication would eliminate the most pill bugs was also proven true.

COMPARISON OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS: DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCE OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: PHASE II
Zoe Elizabeth Teague
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States

A series of experiments was performed to determine the discrimination and preference of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) for sweeteners. Concentration variability was the primary factor evaluated in this experiment. <br><br> Techniques were developed to examine preferences. The test substances (sucrose, aspartame, sucralose, saccharin) were dyed with red and blue food coloring in order to determine the intake of the fruit flies by counting their dyed fecal specks after 48 hours exposure. In previous studies, the fruit flies preferred 10% W/V aqueous solutions of sucrose and aspartame as opposed to 10% W/V aqueous solutions of sucralose and saccharin. In this experiment, the concentrations were changed. The 10% solutions of sucrose and aspartame were used as controls, and 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01% solutions of saccharin and sucralose were used as variables.<br><br> For the procedure, 7-10 flies in a two-sectioned petri dish were provided with a choice of a dyed (red or blue) 10% sucrose or aspartame solutions and a test substance (saccharin or sucralose; 10%, 1%, 0.1%, or 0.01% solutions) dyed the alternate color than the sucrose/aspartame solution. Solutions were presented to the flies on saturated 1 cubic centimeter sections of floral foam. The test substances were in one half of the petri dish, and a semicircular piece of filter paper in the other half. The flies were left in the dishes for 48 hours in a controlled environment of approximately 82ºF (27.78ºC) and 65% relative humidity. They were removed at the end of 48 hours and the dyed fecal specks (red, blue, or purple) were counted to determine preferences.<br><br> The flies showed no change in preference. They still preferred the 10% solutions of aspartame and sucrose in all cases when compared to 10%, 1%, 0.1%, or 0.01% solutions of saccharin or sucralose. <br><br>

THE EXPRESSION OF MEMBRANE PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS IN RHESUS MACAQUE (MACACA MULATTA) OOCYTES
Yufei Cao
Liberty High School, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA

The hormone progesterone induces oocyte maturation in non-mammalian species. Progesterone interacts with a receptor in the plasma membrane of the oocyte and causes cellular changes that enable the oocyte to be fertilized. In mammals such as primates, oocyte maturation is induced by luteinizing hormone (LH) that is released from the adenohypophysis during the middle of the menstrual cycle. It is unknown whether progesterone can act via a membrane receptor in the mammalian oocyte to directly participate in oocyte maturation. This study tested the hypothesis that rhesus macaque oocytes express the gene for the membrane progesterone receptor (mPR), and that this expression changes with different stimulation methods. RNA was extracted from the oocytes and granulosa cells and subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The complementary DNA (cDNA) for the protein of interest was visualized by gel electrophoresis. The results showed the expression of the mPR in the group of oocytes with granulosa cells treated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH, but not in the group treated with FSH alone. This observation of the mPR in rhesus macaque oocytes suggests a role for this signaling pathway in oocyte maturation. This knowledge can be used in the future to develop new methods for controlling fertility in women, either by enhancing or preventing the ability of the oocyte to become fertilized.

EXAMINATION OF LONG-TERM MEMORY IN HETEROZYGOUS MINDBOMB MUTANT ZEBRAFISH
Beatrice Smith Parker
Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

Zebrafish have emerged as attractive animal models for vertebrate development. Mindbomb (mib) is a recessive allele that controls Notch signaling, a process that determines cell fate and controls patterns of neural differentiation. A functioning Notch pathway is crucial for the formation of long-term memory. Faulty Notch has been implicated as a possible cause of Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and dementia. Homozygous recessive mutant zebrafish die soon after birth, whereas heterozygous mib fish appear normal. This experiment uses behavioral tests on “normal” heterozygous mib fish to determine whether they have memory defects related to the mindbomb mutation. Four strains of zebrafish (two control, two mib mutant) were tested using two behavioral tests. In the first, the fish negotiated a simple t-maze with two short arms, one of which opened into a large reservoir, containing a favorable habitat for the fish. Fish were later retested to determine whether they could find the reservoir more quickly. In the second test, conditioned place preference, fish were placed in a rectangular tank divided with a perforated wall that allowed complete movement. Visual cues distinguished one side from the other. Fish were consistently fed on one side of the tank to determine whether they began to spend more time on the side where they were fed. The data suggest that heterozygous mib mutants have long term memory defects, though short term memory appears to be intact. This implies that humans may carry similar recessive genes that cause faulty Notch signaling and therefore, neurodegenerative mental illnesses.<br><br>

HOW ATTRACTIVE ARE YOU...TO MOSQUITOES?
Howell Ross Fishel
Bay High School, Panama City Florida, USA

The decision to test mosquito attractants was made due to the growing concern about mosquito-borne diseases. Background research showed that mosquitoes have an olfactory response to certain substances that leads them to their prey. This project sought to determine if humans unknowingly cause mosquitoes to be attracted to them. The goal of this research project was to answer the question, “Do perfume, stinky socks, Limburger cheese, and dry ice have any attractiveness to mosquitoes?”<br><br> A series of tests was completed, each consisting of five nights of mosquito collection. Three tests were completed in all, with fifteen nights of mosquito sampling. The mosquitoes were counted daily and an average per night was calculated, as well as an overall average. With the exception of dry ice (carbon dioxide), the results were consistent across the tests with little variation among the attractants. The dry ice had the highest count, followed by the perfume, stinky socks, Limburger cheese and then the control. Since all humans exhale carbon dioxide, it is an attractant that cannot be eliminated. The number of mosquitoes in the perfume, stinky socks, and Limburger cheese traps was only slightly higher than the number of mosquitoes in the control trap; this led to the conclusion that these substances are not necessarily attractive to mosquitoes. By knowing what attracts mosquitoes to humans, we can develop better defenses against them. <br><br>

INTELLIGENT AVIARY
Igor Germano Seibert
Fundação Liberato, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil

The project Intelligent Aviary is directed to the creation of laying hens. The hens keep it’s temperature, however it’s attemperator system is little developed to support very high or very low ambient temperatures, being the ambient temperature of ideal thermal comfort for the hens is of 21ºC.<br><br> <br><br> The hens have one weight corporal standard for each stage of it’s life, having this rigorously followed being in order to prevent a bad development that can result in a productivity fall. However, the method of weighing used currently is inadequate, therefore due to sensitivity of the birds, during the weighing, the physical contact between the poultry keeper does not have to occur and the bird, thus preventing stress it. Another problem is the accumulation of dejections of the birds that generates ackward odors, proliferation of insects and harms the income of the poultry keeper and the birds. <br><br> <br><br> In view of all these problems, the project Intelligent Aviary has as objective to create ideal conditions for the creation of the hens, developing a system of control of the ambient temperature, keeping same between 15°C and 25°C, a system of productive weighing without that it has physical contact between man and animal and a hydraulical system of removal of the dejections. With these systems, the aviary starts to have more quality, increase of productivity and the birds receive a bigger comfort, being they, the greaters benefited for the project.<br><br>

EVALUATION OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CELLS FOR IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN BODY RESPONSE
Ashley Loree Pollock
Wiggins Jr-Sr High School, Wiggins, CO, US

This project seeks to determine possible differences in an inflammatory response between cultured primary and secondary macrophage cells through several processes. First, cDNA samples obtained from both primary and secondary cells will be analyzed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and gel electrophoresis for cell production of mRNA message specific to MCP-1, a common inflammatory response cytokine. Cells are then assessed by flow cytometry, for expression of MCP-1, after treatment with a common inflammatory stimulant, lipopolysaccharide. This will support the equivalence or variation of cell lines in the context of modeling the foreign body response to biomaterial placements in vitro. The researcher hypothesized that the primary and secondary cells will display differences in the production of MCP-1 depending on cell maturity and lineage and that cells grown on a control surface (TCPS) will show a significant inflammatory response after being treated with inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide. Differences were found between BMMO (primary bone marrow macrophage) cells and cell lines IC-21, J774A.1, and RAW 264.7. The BMMO cells expressed more MCP-1 than other cell lines.

A FORENSIC STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF SEAWATER ON THE GROWTH RATE OF LOCAL SARCOPHAGID AND CALLIPHORID LARVAE
Genevieve Mount
Santa Cruz High, Santa Cruz, California, United States

The object of my project is to determine, through laboratory experiments and field analysis, what effects seawater have on the growth of maggots feeding on a corpse. I tested if and how maggot growth is effected by seawater saturating the ground under the meat or by meat soaked in seawater. My hypothesis was that the seawater underneath the maggots and meat soaked in seawater will cause the maggots to develop more slowly than maggots raised on plain water or plain meat. <br><br>I conducted my test with wild fly eggs collected from a piece of beef liver left outside for a day. I then raised the maggots in shallow, round containers. Each container held 10 grams of beef liver and 20 maggots. There were four treatment groups: control, seawater under the meat, the meat soaked in seawater for one hour, and the meat soaked in seawater for four hours. The testing environment was controlled, leaving seawater as the only variable.<br><br>The results of my experiment show that the treatments of seawater under the meat, and the meat saturated with seawater had no significant affect on the growth of the maggots. The trend lines for each treatment group have similar slopes, which proves that the seawater around or in the meat did not affect the maggots. A modified box plot of maggot growth rates showed no outliers, further supporting the conclusion. This means that the forensic entomologists do not need to take the salty conditions into account after the maggots have hatched.<br><br>

GAMETIC COMPATIBILITY OF CONSPECIFIC SEA URCHINS, ARBACIA PUNCTULATA
Hillary Ann Futch
Paxon School for Advanced Studies, Jacksonville, Florida USA

Wide ranges of species are known to have variances of fertility rates per individual member of the species. This variation could play a vital role in the interpretation of fertility studies. Sea urchins have been used in a number of fertility studies in the past and it is essential that possible variances in individual fertility be taken into account in those, and future studies.<br><br>This experiment was designed to investigate the possibility of fertility differential as it relates to one species of sea urchin, Gametes from 11 sea urchins were collected and exposed to one another. Each pairing was observed for evidence of fertilization as demonstrated by the lifting of the vitelline membrane and initial cleavage of the egg. 84 chambers were examined; 28 different breeding combinations, repeated three times each.<br><br>The data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and the results showed a statistically significant variation in fertility rates (p=0.025). The data obtained support the theory that there is, in fact, a variation of individual fertility rates in sea urchins. This information could be essential to the interpretation of fertility studies involving this species.<br><br>

DO HERBAL MEMORY ENHANCERS, SUCH AS B12, GINKGO BILOBA, AND ECHINACEA, INCREASE THE LEARNING OF PLANARIA?
Elizabeth Brooke Bailey
Union Grove High School, McDonough, Georgia, USA

Purpose: Based upon previous research, herbal memory enhancers have been shown to increase the learning of a sample subject, planaria. The goal is to determine the type of herbal memory enhancer that will increase the memory of the sample subject the greatest. This is to be perceived as an example of what may happen if Homo sapiens are given a supplement of this substance.<br><br>Hypothesis: Based upon research and experimentation performed by other scientists on using planaria as a test subject, Ginkgo Biloba is believed to be the herbal memory enhancer that will provide the greatest increase in memory.<br><br>Procedures: Research was done on the types of herbal enhancer, planaria, and previous experimentation done by other scientists using planaria. It commenced with the formation solutions of one milligram per one-hundred milliliters of water for each herbal enhancer. The planaria were divided into four groups of seven, three of which were used for the herbal enhancer and one group for a control which received no solution. To test the memory, the planaria were sent through a maze after soaking for two days. They were sent through the maze twice a day for five days, giving a total of ten trips.<br><br>Data: Ginkgo Biloba increased the memory the greatest. This was determined when the planaria continuously moved in the correct direction in the maze. The control, B12, and Echinacea showed little effect on the memory.<br><br>Conclusions: Ginkgo Biloba had the greatest increase in the planaria’s memory, which supports the hypothesis. The B12 and Echinacea had little effect when compared to the control.<br><br>

BIOFUEL AND SOAPS FROM JANITOR FISH (PTERYGOPLICHTHYS PARDALIS) OIL
Raymond Joseph Sarmiento Amurao
Marikina Science High School, Marikina City, Philippines

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>Janitor fish, also known as suckermouth fish or plecos, is not endemic in the Philippines; it was introduced from South America. It has been reproducing very fast that it is now considered a pest in different water bodies like the Marikina River. The fish bores holes on the riverbank causing water turbidity and erosion. People catch them for fun, burning or leaving them to rot along the riverbank. Its oil is considered a waste product in the production of chicken feeds and fish meal. <br><br>This study explored the possible industrial or commercial use of janitor fish oil focusing on production of biofuel and soaps (solid and liquid). Heated and unheated oil were used. Trans-esterification converted the oil into biodiesel with glycerine as a by-product. Saponification process converted the oil into soap. Coco fatty acid was added to glycerine to make the liquid soap or degreaser. <br><br>The resulting biofuel was compared with kerosene, denatured alcohol, cocodiesel and commercial diesel in terms of density, viscosity, suitability of flame and fuel value. Results show that both unheated and heated janitor fish oil can be used for the production of biofuel or as a biodiesel additive. Aside from being renewable, the biofuel from janitor fish is environmental-friendly and will not cause air pollution nor harm the ozone layer. The soaps were compared with the commercial brand in terms of pH, fatty acid/glycerol tests, ability to form lather and cleansing action. The soaps produced possess almost the same qualities as the commercial brand.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF COTTON BOLLWORM RESPONSE TO GOSSYPOL
Yuqian Jiang
Shanghai Weiyu High School, Shanghai, CHINA

Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) is a pest insect which causes heavy loss to cotton production. Plants of cotton accumulate gossypol which is toxic to organisms. However, cotton bollworm still can feed on cotton plants and complete its lifecycle. It is hypothesized that the bollworm has special detoxification mechanisms. The purpose of this research is to analyze the response of cotton bollworm to gossypol and to identify the P450 monooxygenase gene involved in gossypol detoxification, providing data for developing new pest control technology. <br><br> I first investigated the toxicity of gossypol to cotton bollworm, and found that gossypol at 1 mg/g in artificial food had a mild effect on the larval growth; when the concentration was increased to 3 mg/g, larval growth was seriously inhibited. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is a P450 inhibitor. When it was added to the artificial food at 3 mg/g, the larval tolerance to gossypol was significantly reduced. Pupation was failed for about half of the larvae when both PBO and gossypol (2 mg/g) were applied. I further analyzed expression pattern of bollworm P450 genes. RT-PCR analysis showed that a gene named GIP is mainly expressed in the midgut and, more importantly, the expression can be markedly induced by gossypol at concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mg/g.<br><br> My data indicate that cotton bollworm can tolerate a certain amount of gossypol, and the response of cotton bollworm to gossypol involves the P450 gene GIP. This P450 holds a great potential to be used as a target for cotton bollworm control.<br><br>

MODE OF INHERITANCE OF SPINOSAD-RESISTANCE IN LIRIOMYZA TRIFOLII
Emily Victoria Schock
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Florida, United States

Liriomyza trifolii has a high propensity to develop resistance to insecticides such as Spinosad. The mines and stipples caused by larva and female fly’s ovipositor, greatly diminish the level of photosynthesis possible. Premature leaf dropping occurs and wounds in the leaves can allow bacterial and fungal diseases to enter. Leafminers damage both vegetable and flower crops on all continents except Antarctica. Liriomyza trifolii has developed a Spinosad-resistant strain that breeds with the susceptible strain. <br><br> In order to determine if the trait of Spinosad-resistance is dominant or recessive and possibly sex-linked, crosses where made between the resistant and susceptible strains. The experiment was executed with four crosses, Resistant Male with Resistant Female; Susceptible Male with Susceptible Female; Resistant Male with Susceptible Female; and Susceptible Male with Resistant Female. Each cross used a separate cage, each containing four cow pea plants. After the exposure period, two plants from each cross were dipped in Spinosad and two plants were not dipped to act as the control. The experiment was repeated with the same results. The reciprocal cross of the Resistant Male with the Susceptible Female produced virtually no puparium, showing that the trait of Spinosad-resistance is recessive. The reciprocal cross of the Resistant Female with the Susceptible Male had a good survival rate when dipped which suggests possible sex-linkage of the Resistant Female. The results could also show the resistance as an incomplete recessive trait because only one dose of Spinosad was used. No biological problems in the cross of the resistant and susceptible strains occurred. <br><br> The trait of Spinosad-resistance in Liriomyza trifolii can be proven recessive in most circumstances and there is a suggestion of possible sex linkage in the cross between the Resistance Female with the Susceptible Male. <br><br>

A VERSATILE HUNTER: GIANT WOOD SPIDER ADJUSTS WEB STRUCTURE AND SILK PROPERTIES WHEN ENCOUNTERING DIFFERENT PREY
Yi-Chi Chao
The Affiliated Senior High School Of NTNU,Taipei, Taiwan

Previous studies have shown that orb-weaving spiders might adjust their web structures when encountering different types of prey. In this study, the giant wood spider Nephila pilipes was used to investigate the effects of different prey nutrients and vibration signals on the web structures, the physical properties of silk and insect-catching efficiency. To study the correlations, 44 spiders were evenly divided into four feeding groups: live crickets (A), live flies (B), fly vibration signals with dead crickets (C) and cricket vibration signals with dead flies (D). Prior to treatments, all spiders were fed with 3 meal worms daily for 3 days. Then equal weight of prey was introduced after new webs were built and the treatments were conducted for seven times. The web structures, the physical properties of silk, the retention time of different prey, and the vibration signal transmission rate of new webs were analyzed. The results showed that the webs woven by group B spiders exhibited larger area, smaller mesh and longer fly retention time, and reduced vibration signal transmission. Whereas those of group A spiders were stiffer and retained crickets longer, suggesting higher elasticity and strength were generated to cope with the larger prey. However, in groups C and D mismatch between the prey and vibration signals yielded similar results in all parameters measured. These results indicate that spiders can adjust the web structures and physical properties of their silk to enhance the catching efficiency of different prey and that both prey nutrients and vibration signals are critical for such behavioral adjustments.

The purpose of this project is to determine the comparative effects of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, d-alpha tocopheryl succinate, zinc, selenium, superoxide dismutase, Triticum aestivum sprouts, Triticum aestivum seeds, and Triticum aestivum germ, on longevity of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis.<br><br>It is hypothesized that the antioxidant combination (beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, d-alpha tocopheryl succinate, zinc, selenium, and superoxide dismutase) have the greatest positive effect on longevity of the Pogonomyrmex occidentalis than any of the other variables.<br><br>To test the hypothesis, twenty-one ant farms were assembled with thirty Pogonomyrmex occidentalis in each farm. Using three farms for each test group, a cubic-centimeter of ant food and 0.3 milliliter of water was given to each farm every three days. The six supplemental antioxidants were used as the variables. The control received only the ant food. Each farm was fed and the Pogonomyrmex occidentalis was counted and recorded every three days until all the Pogonomyrmex occidentalis expired. The data was graphed and compared to determine which variable had the greatest effect on longevity.<br><br>The results partially supported the hypothesis. The control lived for 1710 total days. The multiple antioxidants group lived 1917 total days, 112% more than the control group. The selenium group lived 2340 total days, 137% more. The group that received the Triticum aestivum seeds lived 2556 total days, 149% more than the control group. The other three variables did not increase longevity: Triticum aestivum sprouts, 1539 total days, 90%; antioxidant enzyme factors, 1674 days, 98%; Triticum aestivum germ, 900 days, 47%.<br><br> <br><br>

A DEVICE FOR DETERMINING THE GENDER OF SALMON USING MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS PHASE 4 OF AGE & MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE & FEMALE KOKANEE SALMON
Susannah Lee Clary
Los Lunas High School, Los Lunas, New Mexico USA

Purpose: To determine if it is possible to design a measuring device to differentiate gender in salmon without harm to the fish.<br><br>Hypothesis: A unique measuring device, utilizing morphological characteristics, can be designed and built to differentiate gender in salmon.<br><br>Procedures: Using the H.L./B.L. ratios obtained from 200 fish in 2003 and 2004, a prototype measuring device to determine the gender of salmon was designed and built.<br><br>Methods: The prototype was used to obtain head length, body length and total length measurements. From these measurements, the gender bar was used to determine the sex of the fish. The data obtained during collecting trips in 2003 and 2004 were included in the final analyses. As such, data from a total of 405 fish are included in this paper. The standard deviation for the averages of the morphological measurements for each age group and year class were calculated and compared using two-sample t-Tests. Binomial confidence intervals of the field tests results were determined using the Adjusted Wald method. <br><br>Results: Of the 205 fish sampled this year, the measuring device correctly determined their sex every time. As in prior years, the probability of the differences between male and female being a result of chance was p < 0.0001. The averages and ranges of the H.L./B.L. ratios were consistent with prior year’s data.<br><br>Conclusions: My hypothesis is correct. It was possible to design and build a device to determine gender in salmon without harm to the fish. The field tests were 100% successful.<br><br>

BDNF REGULATES TASTE BUD DEVELOPMENT AT LATE EMBRYONIC AGES
Amanda Lynn Driskell
Ballard High School, Louisville KY, US

The purpose of this tissue study was to determine when during development brain-derived neurotrophic factor null mutant mice (BDNF knockouts) have fewer and smaller taste buds than wild-type mice and to determine whether taste buds in BDNF-/- mice are formed and then lost at some point during development or whether taste buds fail to develop. It is hypothesized that BDNF knockout taste buds are fewer and smaller than wild-type taste buds at embryonic age 16.5 (E16.5). It is also hypothesized that BDNF knockout taste buds are formed and then lost at some point during development. Six types of tissue were studied: BDNF knockout tissue and wild-type tissue at three embryonic ages. Tissue was obtained and sectioned, taste cells were labeled using immunohistochemistry, taste buds were counted, taste buds images were captured using confocal microscopy, and taste bud volume was measured. Preliminary data suggests that BDNF knockout tissue contained fewer taste buds than wild-type tissue at birth. Data also indicated that BDNF knockout taste buds were smaller than wild-type taste buds at birth. The data also suggests that BDNF knockout taste bud development slows down between E18.5 and birth. Therefore, the hypotheses were not supported.

OSTEOPOROSIS: A PHASE II STUDY OF CALCIUM ABSORPTION AND DEPLETION IN CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA.
Lacy Beth Casteel
Brooks High School, Killen Alabama, United States

In Phase II, an in vivo study of calcium absorption and depletion in Crassostrea virginica, a correlation between the effectiveness of widely used calcium supplements will be shown. In addition, the effect of phosphoric acid (the bone depleting agent in acidic beverages) and estroven (a common all natural woman’s supplement) on the absorption of calcium used will be studied. This experiment will further prove the results presented in Phase I “Osteoporosis: A Study of Calcium Absorption and Depletion in Odocoileus virginianus bone." In each phase II study, Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scans performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham presented numeric values for each oysters' body mass density, bone mineral calcium, fat, lean, area, and percent fat for each specific oyster. These scans were performed before the oysters were subjected to any calcium in their environments, and again after the study concluded. The calcium supplement proven most effective was Oyster Shell Calcium. When estroven was used in combination with Coral Calcium it promoted calcium intake more than Coral Calcium alone. The coral calcium used in this experiment was least effective. In each study the DEXA scans indicated that each group gained mass, except for the study in which phosphoric acid was implemented in the environment. Water samples were taken daily and analyzed with an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer at the University of North Alabama for further results. The phase III portion of this research will involve calcium supplements derived from Asian clams and Zebra mussels from the Tennessee River.

A MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF VARIATION WITHIN MICROSATELLITE LOCI OF A CONTROLLED POPULATION OF WHITE-TAILED DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS) FROM SOUTHERN MARYLAND
Ethan Douglas Sperry
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN, United States of America

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are considered a ubiquitous species in North America with an estimated total population of 26.5 million. The rapid expansion in these populations provides unique opportunities to investigate the role of founder effects and the effects of rapid population growth on genetic diversity. I am investigating the genetic diversity of a population of white-tailed deer that was founded with 7-9 individuals in the 1960s and now has 100-150 individuals culled from the herd each year. The yearly harvest mimics bottleneck events where genomic variation is compromised. In this study, genetic variation between two deer populations (n=137) at Patuxent Naval Air Base and St. Mary’s County, Maryland was analyzed. Nuclear DNA was extracted from heart tissue using Promega Corporation’s DNA IQ™ System. Extracted DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with six microsatellite primers. The PCR products were submitted to fluorescent detection using an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer and data outputs were analyzed using the Gene Scan® 3.1.2 program. Microsatellite results were compared to those published by Anderson et al. (2002) and provide evidence that an increased number of alleles than reported are present. From this, presence of the founder effect is undeterminable due to the likelihood of more founders than thought. However, the bottleneck effect was demonstrated to have limited the genetic diversity within the compound (Sign Test, p<0.001; five loci). These findings are important because they provide a comparison of a ubiquitous species with a population that demonstrates a profound decrease in genetic variation.

THE EFFECTS OF TUNNEL VENTILATION VERSUS CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF COMMERCIAL TURKEY OPERATIONS
Travis Elliott Schaffer
North Daviess, Elnora, Indiana, USA

Turkey producers are searching for improvements in building ventilation. The newest advancement in ventilation in the production of broiler chickens is Tunnel ventilation and this is being compared to the traditional ventilation. Tunnel ventilation is widely used to effectively cool broilers providing a comfortable growing environment that enhances the performance of the flock. The problem with conventional ventilation is that the air is not circulated enough to adequately cool the birds when there is no natural air movement and when the humidity levels are elevated causing the fogging system to be ineffective. Tunnel ventilation is superior in cooling the meat type chickens providing a more comfortable environment and better flock performance. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of tunnel ventilation in turkey grow-out facilities. Results showed that by the use of Tunnel ventilation systems in a commercial turkey operation the livability was increased from 87.57 (conventional ventilation) to 89.34 Tunnel ventilation (+1.77%). The average weight of the birds was increased from 37.40 to 39.17 (+1.77%), this weight improvement at the same age to market reflects a daily gain that is .0129 per day greater than the conventional house. The Tunnel ventilation improved feed performance of the flock by nine points of feed conversion, feed conversion is the amount of feed it takes to produce one pound of meat, measured by the good pounds of meat at the processing plant. The cost to construct and maintaina tunnel ventilated standard sized facility would be approximately forty thousand dollars. This cost could be recovered in just over four years of production.

A CORRELATION STUDY OF BUOYANT AND IN AIR WEIGHING TECHNIQUES FOR CORAL FRAGMENTS
Jared Benjamin Steed
Buckeye Valley High School, Delaware, OH, USA

Coral fragments grown in an aquarium setting, for hobbyists and educational aquariums, reduce harvesting from reefs. Aquarium grown coral can be used to reseed a devastated reef. Coral growth rate is used as a monitoring perimeter when determining ecosystem health. While radiography, density band analysis, alizarin red dye and linear expansion using digital imagery are all coral growth rate measurements; the most common method is the buoyant weight technique. While accurate, waiting for the cessation of water motion is very time consuming. This is part of an ongoing study to compare air weighs with the under water method.<br><br> Fifteen coral fragments each of Acropora formosa, Montipora digitada, and Acropora sp. were harvested and adhered to the surface of pre-fabricated pegs with epoxy. Initially, the peg, epoxy and fragment, were each weighed separately in air and under water. Weight for the assembly was determined in both mediums weekly over six weeks. From the buoyant weight, a calculated air weight was determined. The data were analyzed using a Pearson correlations and linear regressions divided by species. The R-statistics from the correlations were found to be .94, .84, and .99 for Acropora formosa, Montipora digitada, and Acropora sp. respectively. Regression R2 values were .88, .71, and .99 respectively with p-values all less than the alpha value of .05. The data suggests that while buoyant weight and air weight are not equal there is a strong positive correlation.<br><br>

MOLLUSKS IN DECLINE: AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF A RARE FRESHWATER MUSSEL (MARGARITIFERA FALCATA)
Emily Sarah Munday
Butte High School, Butte, MT, USA

Clam Creek is a small East-slope stream near the Continental Divide, named for a unique freshwater mussel population that anecdotal accounts say was once abundant. Initial investigation found “clams” to be Margaritifera falcata (Bivalvia: Unionidae)—normally a West-slope species. Initial investigation also led to discovery of white soil along the creek banks and a previously undocumented warm spring. M.falcata seemed scarce with few young mussels present.<br><br> An ecological investigation was conducted based on the following hypotheses:(1) Unique ecological factors – e.g. white soil along the creek’s banks and the warm spring source – will explain the presence of M. falcata;(2) M. falcata glochidia crossed the Continental Divide on host fish Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi. Clam Creek M. falcata will show measurable differences in mitochondrial DNA compared with nearby West-slope M. falcata;(3) Management measures can be identified to protect this and similar populations of rare freshwater mussels. <br><br> Research tools used included mitochondrial DNA analysis, water and soil chemical analysis, physical stream measurements, and scanning electron microscopy.<br><br> Conclusions:(1) Temperature, alkalinity, conductivity, and pH differed from nearby streams; other streams lacked rich mineral content and warm temperature. White soils were composed of diatoms;(2) Surprisingly, this M. falcata population did not show significant genetic differences compared with West-slope populations;(3) Management issues include cattle grazing that has eliminated willows and led to bank erosion and siltation; a dam that traps silt and blocks downstream migration; and cattle excrement that probably elevates stream ammonia. <br><br>

UTILIZING SCIENCE TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITY: PROTEIN METABOLISM IN TILAPIA FISH FOR OPTIMAL GROWTH. YEAR 3 (OREOCHROMIS HYBRIDS)
Annette Joy Mendivil
Casa Grande Union High School, Casa Grande, AZ, United State of America

Our tribal community’s priority in economic development is to continue stewardship for our natural resources and provide for the essential needs of our people today and for future generations. My research in aquaculture production means a return to the community’s cultural roots and a way of having economic diversity. This year’s experiment determined protein efficiently in tilapia fish. A total of six tanks were used to raise 200 male tilapia fish per tank to test the hypothesis that a multiple feeding schedule could stimulate protein efficiently for optimal growth. This experiment demonstrated that giving tilapia fish their total daily protein in five portions throughout the day lets the fish gained significantly more weight than fish fed once or twice a day. The average weight for all fish at the beginning of the project was 1 gram, with the average gain for four months 79.67 grams. The experiment showed the fish only gained 15% of the overall weight when fed their total daily protein ration (TDP) once a day. Fish fed twice a day (TDP) gained 20%, but fish fed five times a day (TDP) gained 65% of the total over a 4 month period. The results of the project demonstrated that protein could be metabolized more efficiently with multiple feedings. The information gained will help our tribal farm staff members raise tilapia fish in a more economically viable way to sell to Arizona grocery stores and restaurants.

HOW THE BRAIN AND BODY LEARN RIGHT FROM LEFT: REVEALING EMBRYONIC SYMMETRY-BREAKING MECHANISMS THROUGH IN VITRO AND MATHEMATIC
Sarah Kate Rapoport
Horace Mann School; Bronx, New York; USA

This project consists of two parts: (a) experimental demonstration that myosin is a molecular motor propelling migrating neurons during development, and (b) mathematical demonstration that molecular-motor-driven beating cilia in gastrulae create the initial left-right asymmetry during mammalian development.<br><br>Mammalian brain development requires that neurons migrate from germinal zones to predestined locations. These experiments demonstrate that myosin is a molecular motor propelling neurons along glial processes during brain development. cDNA for a portion of the myosin light-chain, fused to the fluorescent probe Venus, was inserted into cerebellar granule cells. Fluorescent immunostaining identified this Venus-tagged protein as intracellular myosin. Blebbistatin inhibition of myosin function demonstrated that neuronal migration is myosin-dependent. Using high-speed live confocal microscopy, Venus-tagged myosin was observed propelling developing neurons as they migrate along glial processes.<br><br>Embryonic left-right asymmetries first appear as differences in gene activation on either side of the node, the structure of mammalian gastrulae that provides a midline for the embryo. Embryologic theory hypothesizes that node cell cilia—beating counterclockwise—are responsible for creating an observed net leftward fluid current, and establishing morphogen gradients that create left-right asymmetries in the developing embryo. This mathematical model supports the concept that beating node cilia produce this net leftward current.

OVERWINTERING ADAPTATIONS OF CUCUJUS CLAVIPES
Kennan L. Jeannet
Jeannet Homeschool, Fairbanks, Alaska, USA

Some of the overwintering adaptations of the beetle Cucujus clavipes in its larval stage were analyzed, including supercooling points (SCPs), absolute body water content (ABS), thermal hysteresis activity (THA) and heat shock protein (HSP-70) production. We also sought to silence the expression of the thermal hysteresis protein genes using RNAi (RNA interference). This is the third year of a four-phase research plan to examine the overwintering strategies of C. clavipes. Insects were caught in Wiseman, Alaska (the farthest northern range of C. clavipes), and compared with insects from Fairbanks, Alaska. I hypothesized that the SCPs and ABS would decrease over the course of winter and be correlated. In addition, amounts of HSP-70 transcript will increase from August until the time when insects begin to enter diapause. Lastly, I hypothesized that introducing small double stranded RNAi would inhibit the production of the targeted antifreeze proteins. Wiseman insects were kept in an enclosure in Fairbanks and tested weekly for SCPs and body water content. Samples were also taken for HSP analysis. RNAi was injected into C. clavipes and the amounts of THA in RNAi injected insects was compared to that of two control groups (water injected insects and non-injected insects). Results showed that SCP and ABS in C. clavipes were correlated. RNAi injections did knock down the gene expressions of the targeted antifreeze proteins, and amounts of HSP-70 were present and increased over the course of the testing period.

THE ROLE OF SEROTONIN PATHWAYS IN MOUSE COMPULSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER
Harpreet Kaur Sangha
West Valley High School, Fairbanks, Alaska, United States of America

The serotonin system has been implicated as the underlying mechanism behind the manifestation of human Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Male house mice, Mus domesticus, bidirectionally selected for nest-building levels exhibit a 40-fold difference in the amount of cotton used for nesting between high nest-builders (BIG) and low nest-builders (SMALL).The spontaneous nesting behavior of BIG mice resembles compulsive behaviors seen in human OCD. A murine animal model in which the dorsal raphe nucleus was inactivated was used to investigate the role of serotonin pathways in mediating compulsive-like nesting behavior. Mice were tested for nesting behavior and wheel-running activity (a control behavior) under normal and experimental conditions. Both BIG and SMALL mice expressed no significant change in scores of nest-building. However, there was a significant reduction in wheel-running behavior noted in the BIG mice, while no significant difference was found in the SMALL mice. It appears that the dorsal raphe nucleus does not regulate compulsive-like nesting behavior. Wheel-running data implicates that the dorsal raphe nucleus, however, does play a large role in regulating locomotor activity in only BIG mice. However, immunocytochemistry evaluation of lesion location and size is needed to confirm these findings. <br><br><br>

GLYCOGEN INDUCES EXTENSION OF PHARYNX DURING FEEDING IN PLANARIANS
Seira Shimoyama
Urawa Daiiti Girls High School, Urawa City, Saitama Perfecture, JAPAN

Although planarians are widely used as experimental animals for developmental biology, mechanisms of their feeding behaviors are scarcely elucidated. I therefore examined precise patterns of behaviors leading to feeding and investigated factors inducing feeding in planarians.<br><br> Planarians gathered toward food and extended their pharynges to it. Detailed observations of their feeding behavior clarified that the behavior consisted of a series of 5 elements, i.e., migration, exploration, halt, pharyngeal extension and food ingestion. Planarians lacking the brain failed to show any element of the behavior, while the larynx-less animals showed migration and exploration but failed to halt on food. It is therefore concluded that the sense organ exists in the area around the pharynx.<br><br> Planarians are carnivorous and live on flesh food. However what is the key component of flesh in inciting feeding is not known. In order to find out what induces the feeding behavior in planarians, a drop of animal blood, plasma or blood corpuscles was placed ahead of the worm. Planarians invariably extended their pharynges toward these samples. They immediately ingested blood corpuscles but would not eat blood or plasma at all. Furthermore, they failed to react to sorts of cellular components and ingredients, i.e., protein, sodium inosinate, phosphatide (lecithin), monosaccharide (glucose) and maltose. However, they strongly reacted and extended their pharynges to glycogen promptly. <br><br> Glycogen is widely contained in animal cells. The present experiments clearly demonstrated that glycogen plays an important role in feeding as a potent attractant of planarians.<br><br>

CORAL BLEACHING ADAPTATION
Malcolm Bruce Young
Centaurus High Schoo, Lafayette, Colorado, U.S.A.

Coral bleaching is the leading cause of coral reef destruction and is increasing in frequency. This is the process by which corals expel symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium)—their source of food—from within their tissues causing the coral to starve.<br><br>This project’s purpose is to investigate aquarium coral’s extreme tolerance to bleaching conditions along with techniques for spreading this tolerance to wild corals. The possibility of conditioning a coral for higher tolerances was studied as well. The chemical triggers that activate bleaching mechanisms are also investigated as to whether the triggers must be present or in quantity to initiate bleaching.<br><br>In order to investigate and confirm these topics, a test aquarium was created where temperature (most common cause of bleaching) was easily controlled, monitored, and recorded. <br><br>Through testing of aquarium and wild coral fragments, it was found that aquarium corals can withstand 10 degrees temperature rise in some cases as opposed to 1-3 degrees of tolerance in wild coral.<br><br>Through research it was found that this tolerance is most likely attributed to the strain of symbiotic algae and that strains can be absorbed into a host coral through the gastrovascular cavity. By culturing this algae and inserting it into wild coral, increasing the tolerances of and entire reef may be possibly. Coral temperature conditioning was demonstrated in testing when preferential expulsion of weaker Symbiodinium strains was observed. Lastly, the need for chemical bleaching triggers to be present in quantity was confirmed because increased temperature stress over time was required for bleaching.<br><br>

YEAR TWO: A STUDY TO FIND THE BEST LIVING SITUATIONS FOR TILAPIA--FOOD SOURCE
Gabriel Heath Miller
Lefors I.S.D., Lefors, Texas

This project was completed to learn if Tilapia grow better in water that has only aquaponics as the food source, has only food pellets as the food source, or has aquaponics and food pellets as the food source. Believing that water with both <br><br>aquaponics and food pellets as the food source would support best growth, I <br><br>began my project.<br><br>Two fish were put in each 12 gallon tank. Two tanks had only aquaponics as the food source, two tanks had only pellet food as the food source, and two tanks had aquaponics and pellet food as the food source. All parameters of the experiment were kept the same per tank. For nine weeks, I studied the growth of these fish by measuring them on a weekly basis. <br><br>Observing the behavior and growth of the fish in the tanks with only aquaponics led me to remove the fish and return them to their original habitat. The remaining fish had normal behavior and growth.<br><br>Proving my hypothesis, my data shows that fish in tanks with both food sources grow an average of .11oz, and .5cm more per week than those in tanks with just pellet food. I was unable to compare growth rates of tanks with just aquaponics due to the removal of the fish.<br><br>These results will be taken into consideration in the future at the fish farm in Lefors. As director of the fish farm, I plan to investigate this project further in the future.<br><br>

CAVE HARVESTMEN ADAPTATIONS
Eric Bryan Freeze
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad New Mexico, United States of America

This project's purpose was to provide knowledge on how two isolated cave Harvestmen groups play their roles in specific cave ecosystems. This is important in understanding how we can preserve these fragile cave environments. Organisms found in caves could possibly be used to create cures for cancer, and other diseases. Saving one organism in a cave ecosystem will save the others as well, which could indirecltly save people's lives. The Harvestmen play vital roles in their own specific ecosystems. With the information gathered we can alter their environments keep them balanced. This would also save the other species in the caves that are reliant on the Harvestmen. These other organisms may be important in finding cures. <br><br> Both groups of Harvestmen are found in Carlsbad New Mexico. One group is found at Parks Ranch cave, (a gypsum cave), and the other at Lair cave, (a limestone cave). Observations made were estimations of population counts of the Harvestmen, and behavioral observations of them compared to each other, along with typical Harvestmen. An anatomy and physiology comparison was also analized. Both groups show adaptations similar to each other, but different compared to typical Harvestmen. These adaptations include: spines on their front legs and pedipalps, and slightly larger claws than typical Harvestmen. Two main different adaptations comparing both groups of cave Harvestmen were that the Parks Ranch Harvestmen survive during cave flooding, and that Velvet Mites attach to the Lair cave Harvestmen for transportation. Both groups of Harvestmen have been found to be similar enough that they may be able to survive in each other's habitats. This may need to be used in the future since there was a vandalism that took place at Parks Ranch cave. If needed, it may be possible to introduce a small group of Harvestmen from Lair cave to Parks Ranch cave, in order to keep a balanced ecosystem.

I wanted to find out what seeds different birds like and possible reasons for this. I also wanted to learn what seeds that captive doves and pigeons like. I wanted to compare a mix based on my results against a commerical wild bird seed brand. <br><br>I thought that the wild birds would like the cracked corn and the black oil sunflower seeds and hate the thistle. I thought the captive birds would love the cracked corn and the black oil sunflower seeds. I thought they would somewhat like the safflower and hate the thistle. <br><br>I needed birds, 7 terracotta saucers, different separated seeds, a graduating cylinder, and a field guide. <br><br>I bought the seeds and measured equal amounts in each dish. I put them in a place where the birds come regularly. In the evening I measured what was left. For the captive doves and pigeons I performed a similar experiment for a few days. I then tested safflower against Pennington. I last made mixtures based on the results and tested them against Pennington.<br><br>I realize that birds like the seeds that grow in birds' native biome. Some birds also like seeds that are from the area they are from.

PREDATOR BEHAVIOR OF CORETHRELLA APPENDICULATA
Sonya Makhni
Saint Edward's Upper School, Vero Beach, Florida, United States of America

The predator Corethrella appendiculata is a predator in aquatic container habitats. Previous experiments showed that the predator C. appendiculata kills a majority of its mosquito prey without consumption immediately preceding pupation to adulthood (< 36 hours). To explore this behavior further, the behavioral differences between the Corethrella predators that killed and consumed prey versus those that killed prey without consumption were examined.<br><br>An experiment was set up using 13 Corethrella predators that were within 24 hours of pupation. Predators were placed into separate cups with varying ratios of 1st or 2nd instar Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae. Individual cups were recorded via video camera for one hour trials. Behavior factors were closely monitored. Factors included predator position, orientation, strike success, and movement and prey location and consumption.<br><br>There were, indeed, some behavioral differences between the Corethrella predators demonstrating both types of behavior. Generally, released prey are bitten quickly on the thorax by the predator and left to die- 89% strikes to thorax ended this way. Corethrella also make most of their strikes at the bottom of the container, and they have significantly high success rates of attack. Strikes to the abdomen are significantly less than those to the head, siphon, or thorax, and predator pre-strike orientation proved to not be a significant factor. <br><br>The Corethrella do not bite nor affect humans and mammals but do prey upon other species of mosquitoes that do. In the future, Corethrella might be used in the field as a cost-efficient source of pest control. <br><br>

TROUBLE IN PARADISE? ASSESSMENT OF INTERANNUAL AND SPATIAL VARIABLILITY ON A RED SEA FRINGING CORAL REEF
Zaki Daniel Moustafa
A.W. Dreyfoos High School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Fl, USA

A new hydrocarbon off-loading facility and nearby coastal development are beginning to impact a small, isolated, pristine fringing coral reef (approximately 0.5 km wide by 1.0 km long), located in the northern Red Sea (29o 32’N & 32o 24’E). Underwater digital photographs and fixed transect videos were collected in summer 2004 to document baseline coral coverage, dominant coral species, and fish abundance and diversity. Surveys were repeated in summer 2005 to assess interannual changes. Water quality and temperature data were obtained to characterize environmental conditions, while sediment constituents were analyzed to indicate recent reef history.<br><br>Digital image analysis indicates that Finger, Staghorn, Anemone, and Neptheidae corals comprise nearly 90% of the reef, with approximately 15% (mainly Staghorn) classified as dead. The southernmost sector of the reef contains four times more dead coral than other regions. A comparison between 2004 and 2005 surveys indicates that coral coverage did not change significantly.<br><br>Possible environmental stress indicators such as scars on Anemone coral patches caused by fish bites, and newly bleached coral heads were identified in 2005. However, reef-fish diversity surpassed 2004 observations, and sediment constituent analysis indicates active coral growth and break-down; both signs of a healthy reef.<br><br>An oil spill occurred, less than one kilometer offshore while sampling during summer 2005, and an initial assessment was documented. Accidents of this nature, an increase in shipping traffic, and tankers offloading oil are expected to degrade reef health. Spatial and temporal changes will continue to be monitored to determine this fragile community’s survivalship.<br><br>

Observations of differential growth rates of Silver Trevally species at Lord Howe Island and on the east coast of Australia have indicated that there is a possible genetic difference between the two populations. <br><br>This study was undertaken to compare the genetic sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI-5’), which has been used to define species in the ‘Bar-coding for Life’ project. A 655 base-pair fragment of the COI-5' gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced.<br><br>Sequence comparisons between the two groups of Silver Trevally showed that at 31 sites in the 655 base pair sequence, the two populations were genetically different. Furthermore, the two groups of Silver Trevally differed at 97 sites in the 655 base pair sequence to the control, Trumpeter Whiting. <br><br>This data indicates that the two groups of Silver Trevally are sufficiently genetically distinct, to enable the species at Lord Howe Island to be classified distinctly, and I propose that the species at Lord Howe Island be given a new name, Pseudocaranx howeana.

DROPPING LIKE FLIES: A STUDY OF LIFE STAGE BACTERIAL EXPOSURE OF DROSOPHILIA AND EFFECT ON LONGEVITY
Kahla Nichole White
Latta High Schools, Ada OK, USA

Research has indicated that environmental exposure to microbes is crucial in the development of children’s immune systems. However, children raised in industrialized countries have developed increasing problems with allergies, asthma, and common childhood infections. The purpose of this project was to determine whether early bacterial exposure would promote an enhanced immunity development and thus produce greater longevity in Drosophila melanogastor. It was hypothesized that Drosophila exposed to bacteria from birth will experience enhanced longevity more so than sterilely reared Drosophila exposed to bacteria late in life. <br><br> Drosophila were exposed to normally occurring environmental bacteria cultured separately from soil and from pond water. They were additionally exposed to E. coli K-12 strain bacteria. One milliliter of bacteria culture was added to the Drosophila food in each vial and twenty newly hatched flies placed into the vials. Controls were prepared in the same manner, but without bacteria. Vials with the same food and cultured bacteria were prepared for the adult exposed flies. Deaths were recorded daily. This process was replicated twice. <br><br> Drosophila exposed to bacteria early in life had a greater longevity than those exposed to bacteria late in life. The mean 50% mortality for early exposed flies was reached in 10.33 days while the late exposed was 8.3 days, a 17% longevity reduction.<br><br>The early exposure mean was approximately equal to the control.<br><br> In conclusion, time of exposure in an organism’s life to bacteria seemed to impact the organism’s longevity quite likely due to an earlier development of their immune system. <br><br>

"MAKING THE GRADE" AN ASSESSMENT OF BEEF QUALITY
Megan Jean Webb
Keyser High School, Keyser,W.V. , U.S.A.

<br><br> Today the United States beef industry faces intensified competition as chicken and other proteins are challenging beef as the king. Beef producers must produce a quality product and educate and boost consumer confidence to regain the beef market share. To accomplish this, a uniform highly desirable product (Yield Grade three or higher carcasses, USDA Quality Grade Choice or higher, and freedom of costly round injection site lesions)must be produced. <br><br> To test the uniformity of local beef and compare it with the benchmark national standards determined by the 2000 Beef Quality Audit Standard, thirty four steers from five eastern panhandle counties were inspected at Flying W. Farms Meat Processing under the supervision of Richard Woodworth, owner and animal scientist. Carcasses were evaluated by the student researcher using USDA and quality assurance factors. Yield grades were determined by a mathematical calculation. Quality grades were determined as Prime, Choice, or Select based on the degree of marbling measured in the ribeye muscle and the maturity factor. The student researcher also inspected carcass rounds for the presence of injection site lesions and analyzed data to determine results. Locally the combined thirty four carcasses exceeded the national results in two of three criteria. <br><br> Phase II of the research included a live animal ultrasound evaluation of sixty nine West Virginia produced bulls on test at West Virginia University's research farm. This data was analyzed and used as a basis of genetic carcass merit for this study. <br><br>

IS THAT GAS BUGGIN' YOU?
Colleen Sutton Heacock
Clark High School, Plano Texas, United States

This project explores the effects of different gasses on a cricket antenna. It is hypothesized that the cricket antenna will react the most to oxygen. In order to measure the reaction of the antenna, a circuit was built that can run an electrical current through the antenna. The circuit then monitors the change in the voltage as the resistance of the antenna changes. This allows the antenna’s change in conductivity to be measured in millivolts. Different gasses were then created and were blown across the antenna in pulses, to keep the antenna from being saturated with the gas. Of the gasses tested, hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and oxygen, none caused the antenna to react. It was know from previous studies that the resistance in the antenna changes when exposed to human breath, and these antennas continued to react to human breath throughout the experiment. The antenna did show a change in resistance to temperature, though not as much as it does to breath. The antenna’s reaction to coldness was about the same amount that it showed towards heat. The findings in this experiment that a cricket antenna is sensitive to temperature and human breath can lead to the creation of a temperature sensitive biosensor, a security device, or as a sensor in oxygen tanks.

PBX1AND PBX2 AFFECT HOX GENE EXPRESSION AND CHONDROGENESIS DURING LIMB DEVELOPMENT
Victoria Ann Wells
Fort Lee High School, Fort Lee, NJ, USA

The development of the vertebrate body is very complex. Limbs form during embryogenesis as buds of tissue from the body wall. Subsequently, the formation and patterning of different skeletal elements from this relatively unorganized tissue is under the influence of Homeobox (Hox) genes and proteins. Pbx proteins collaboratively bind DNA with a large subset of Hox proteins to help execute this patterning. To determine the roles of Pbx in limb patterning, we reconfirmed our previous studies by performing numerous in situ hybridizations on mouse embryonic limb buds lacking Pbx1 and Pbx2. Previous studies have shown that these mutants (i.e., Pbx1-/-; Pbx2+/-)possess severe defects in their limbs. We have studied the limb buds of the same mutant types and observed that Hox gene expression was spatially deregulated in them, indicating a possible genetic basis for the observed skeletal defects. To explore the underlying cellular basis for these skeletal defects, we performed in vitro experiments (via micromass) on mesenchymal cells from these mutant limb buds. Preliminary Pbx1-/-; Pbx2+/- mutant micromass culture results show more chondrocyte nodules than those of the wild type (wt) suggesting accelerated chondrogenesis (hypertrophy). These latter results need to be regarded as preliminary subject to future verification. Furthermore, while the presence of extra nodules may be indicative of hypertrophy, further studies would be required to check other known signatures of hypertrophy (i.e. genes for collagen 10 and Sox.) The goal of this research is to gain a better understanding as to how alterations in patterning genes and signals may influence cellular differentiation and proliferation in the developing limbs. This knowledge may allow us to understand the underlying mechanisms influencing cartilage development ultimately leading to methods of repairing damaged cartilage in cases such as arthritis.

SHOO FLY SHOO YEAR 5: AN ORDER COMPARISON THE PUPACIDAL EFFECT OF VARIOUS MINT ESSENTIAL OILS ON DIPTERANS
Howard Malcolm Tomlinson
Brenham High School, Brenham, Texas, Washington County

The purpose of this project was to determine if mint essential oils such as Pennyroyal, Peppermint and Wintergreen would be effective in inhibiting the hatching of various Dipterans such as Musca domestica (house flies) Sarcophaga bullata (blow flies) and Drosophila melanogaster. Fly pupae was used in a transparent cylinder which contained a sample of the mint being tested. The pupae were observed for several days to determine the number of hatched pupae compared to unhatched pupae. The results were recorded. Of the mint oils tested, 100% inhibited the hatching of flies to some degree. The pupacidal effect of various mint essential oils on dipterans are as follows: pennyroyal 63.3%, peppermint 59.43% and wintergreen mint 69.6%. The average natural death rate of the dipterans tested was 9.9%. I conclude that all mint essential oils tested significantly inhibited the hatching of the Dipterans tested to a large degree. I believe that my project went very well. My project would be of great significance to the pesticide industry because it is an inexpensive and chemical-free way to inhibit the hatching of insects in the Dipteran order including blow flies, gnats, houseflies and mosquitoes. Through this experiment, I have learned that various types of mint essential oils can inhibit hatching of Dipterans.

REGENERATION ANOMALIES IN PLANARIA SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS PHTHALATE ESTERS
Jessica Leann Baker
Seneca High School, Seneca, Missouri

Phthalate esters are chemical compounds often added to plastics, cosmetics, and personal care products. Phthalates are highly dangerous to humans and the environment. Planaria (Dugesia tigrina) were chosen as a test subject due to their swift ability to regenerate by using stem cells, which are also present in humans. In this blind study, planaria were cut into three segments and then exposed to four commonly used phthalates. The results of this experiment verify that all the tested phthalates were either toxic or detrimental to the regeneration of planaria. Regeneration anomalies included neoplasms in the head region and missing eyes. Results revealed that the phthalates caused death or regeneration anomalies with statistical significance (p < 0.001) compared to both the blind and observed control groups.

A NEW UNIQUE SPECIES OF THE ARBOREAL CRICKET OF THE GROUP RILEYI (INSECTA:ORTHOPTERA:ENSIFERA) FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ZONES IN PUERTO RICO
Keysha Karelis Reyes - Olivo
José Santos Alegría, Dorado, Puerto Rico

This investigation was developed in the central and northern zones of Puerto Rico. In these zones exists the Muntigia calabura tree, which serves as habitat to a species of arboreal cricket. The Muntigia calabura tree from the central and northern zones of Puerto Rico is know as the snoring tree because of the stereophonic sound that comes from it. The purpose of this study was to determine if the arboreal cricket of the central and northern zones of Puerto Rico belong to the same species, and to compare it with other species such as niveus, nigricornis, fultoni and varicornis of others countries.In the Rileyi group it was compared with the species of fultoni and niveus. In this research, it was found that the arboreal cricket from Puerto Rico belongs to a new unique species of the Rileyi group (Insecta:Orthoptera:Ensifera). The identification and the comparison were based in the key of the marcs in the first two segments in the antennas, frequency and music scale of their songs. The sound was analyzed and filtered using a spectrometer (TSR) and a spectrogram (Xp 2002). The song of the new species originated from the friction of the hind wings, and has a frequency of 2,000 Hz. Using the G music scale, the tone of the new species was C.

SOIL INVERTEBRATE BIODIVERSITY INDEXES AT THE CARIBBEAN NATIONAL FOREST, PUERTO RICO: RESPONSE TO FOREST BIOMASS PRODUCTION, ALTITUDE AND SOIL PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS
Jorge A. Fernandez-Vidro
Colegio Sonifel, Diego Zalduondo St., Fajardo, PUERTO RICO

The goal for this project was to establish whether or not soil invertebrate biodiversity at each of the forest types within the Caribbean National Forest (Tabonuco, Palo Colorado, Palma de Sierra, and Dwarf Forest)is dependent on soil physico-chemical parameters. By correlating biodiversity indexes with soil edaphic conditions such as moisture, acidity, and temperature it was thought that a relationship between them could be found. <br><br> Shannon's Index (H') was used to calculate biodiversity and evenness of soil invertebrates present at each of the forest types based on the data obtained by the classification and recording of abundances for each taxa collected through Berlese-Tullgren extraction. Soil acidity and temperature were determined using a thermistor-type thermometer and a soil pH meter. Moisture content was determined through the indirect-weight method. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to analyze the cumulative proportions contributed by the taxa for each forest.<br><br> Of the four forests, Palo Colarado presented the highest biodiversity (H'=1.65) contrary to the hypothesis that Tabonuco (H'=1.42) would have had the highest index. Dwarf Forest (H'=1.08), the least diverse, had an acidity of 6.9 and diversity increased with acidity for each forest. Palo Colorado's moisture (53.3%) and temperature (20°C) appeared to be most favorable given it's high diversity.<br><br> The results evidenced that soil invertebrate biodiversity is dependent on the physico-chemical parameters. Also it was found that diversity index increased proportionally with soil acidity. Sites with temperature and soil moisture different from apparently optimal values (such as those at Palo Colorado) presented decreased biodiversity indexes.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF MUSKRAT BEHAVIOR ON LAKE FISH
Aurelia Eugenia-Glory DeNasha
Fond du Lac Ojibwe School, Cloquet Minnesota, USA

In the Ojibwe Creation story, the muskrat dove down into the sea to collect sediment to recreate the Earth after the great flood. Hypothesis: The muskrat behavior of scooping up sediment to create dens produces a "dip" in lakebeds that is beneficial to fish during times of oxygen deprivation. This project has three parts. First, an equal amount of water was poured into two containers, one wide and shallow, the other narrow and deep. Both were exposed to a heat lamp and water temperatures in both were measured over time. Second, a single container of water was heated. A portable dissolved oxygen meter was used to read oxygen levels between the lower and upper temperature limits for golden shiners. Third, a fish tank, rocks, and lake water were used to replicate a "dip" created by muskrats. One end was shallow and the other deep. Both ends contained a thermometer and an aeration tube. The shallow end also had an aquarium heater and artificial vegetation. After acclimating, golden shiners were released into the tank of water set at their ideal temperature, and observed. The fish were expected to inhabit the entire tank, then migrate to the deeper, cooler area when the temperature of the shallow end was raised to the shiners’ upper tolerance limit. The hypothesis was supported; the experiments showed that deep water is cooler than shallow water, cool water has more oxygen than warm, and muskrat "dips" are beneficial for fish during times of oxygen deprivation.

ANALYZING PLANARIAN REGENERATION IN SOLUTIONS ON MIMOSA PUDICA EXTRACT
Sindhura Kunaparaju
Elmont Memorial High School, Elmont, New York, USA

Identifying natural ways to accelerate regeneration is crucial in medicine, cosmetics, and health. Studying potential accelerants of planarian regeneration can propose its future use on other animals.<br><br>A planarian model was chosen to investigate the effect of Mimosa pudica, a touch sensitive plant, on regeneration. The freshly prepared Mimosa pudica extract was then used for the four trials. Each group consisted of four Petri dishes with individual dishes containing one Planaria. Group A contained 9mL of water and 1mL of extract. Group B contained 9.9mL of water and .1mL of extract. Group C contained 10mL of water and .01mL of extract. And finally the control group contained 10mL of water and no extract. Four trials were then performed for seven days each.<br><br>Mean regeneration time was 4.2 days in Group B, with regeneration time for all experimental groups less than the control. Experimental groups also demonstrated greater replication rates. A two-sample t-Test confirmed statistically significant differences in regeneration between all experimental groups and control. Results show that Mimosa pudica can accelerate regeneration in planaria.<br><br>

LOOKING A TOAD IN THE EYE II THE BLACK BOX
Fleur Leussink
Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands TX, United States

Does a toad’s ability to determine prey reside only as long as the eye’s visual input is available? Does a toad’s optic tectum switch to processing auditory and tactile information to determine spatial relations? It was hypothesized that the shift in sensory input to the optic tectum would compensate for the lost visual information. Toads catch prey as a reflex to movement, through nerves cells in the retina which alert the reflex center. In humans, Pascual-Leone tested blind subjects and determined that their visual cortex instead of their somatosensory cortex responded to Braille reading within three days. Applying Pascual-Leone’s theory to a toad’s visual system would determine a toad’s ability to compensate for lost spatial information. Six toads were placed in absolute darkness for 70 hours, experiencing touch, auditory, and visual stimulations (to mouth, front and back limbs) in 2,040 trials. The control of absolute darkness was considered through the movement of a visual stimulus throughout the 70 hours. When the toad was first put into the dark (0 hours) no response was observed, after two hours the toads responded to the mouth stimulus, after 4 hours the front limbs, and after 10 hours the back limbs. The auditory stimulus was not acted upon until the 50 hour tests. During the 70 hours, accuracy increased as response time decreased. The hypothesis is supported through T-tests and Chi-square; results in the experiment give a strong indication that the toads used other senses to obtain the spatial relations to catch their prey.

THE CORRELATION OF BACKFAT ON SWINE CARCASS QUALITY
Emily Katherine Arkfeld
Lourdes Central Catholic, Nebraska City, Nebraska, USA

There is no doubt that today’s consumer is conscientious of the calorie content of a given foodstuff, yet time and time again flavor is what ultimately determines both satisfaction and repeat purchases. Although today’s pork producers can consistently provide a high lean product, there are concerns as to whether this continues to meet the ever-changing palates of today’s consumer. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to discern the interrelationship between backfat deposition, a component of today’s lean pork production techniques, and pork quality. Research was conducted over a three year period in three phases with the goal of improving the quality of pork carcass. This year I completed Phase III of my project which involved determining the effect of backfat on carcass quality. I determined the correlation between backfat deposition and intramuscular fat, loin muscle area, color, genetic line meat quality. Phase I was to determine the effects of the Rendement Napole (RN gene) on intramuscular pH and drip loss while Phase II identified the effect of the RN gene on meat tenderness, color, cooking loss and palatability. <br><br>My procedure involved collecting carcass data at Kreimer’s Locker and Sioux-Preme Packing Plant in Sioux City, Iowa. The carcasses were measured for backfat and loin size. Intramuscular fat (marbling) scores were taken and color tests were conducted using the Minolta Color Test. Throughout my experiment, there was no measurable correlation between backfat deposition, lean deposition, and pork quality. <br><br>In conclusion, my hypothesis that backfat and marbling having no correlation was proven.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF A NATURAL ANTIOXIDANT AND FLAVONOID ON OXIDATIVE STRESS RESISTANCE AND LONGEVITY IN GENETICALLY SUPPRESSED C. ELEGANS
Devin Indi Marmel
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX, USA

Under the basis of the free radical theory of aging, oxidative free radicals and decreased concentrations of antioxidants represent one of the major causes of shortened lifespan in aerobic organisms. The effects of oxidative stress can be countered by the production of stress proteins within the cell. The presence of antioxidants can enhance the defenses against free radicals in organism. Recent studies have shown that many flavonoids, depending on their molecular structure, have the capacity for antioxidant behavior. The purpose of this project is to analyze the effects of a natural antioxidant and flavonoid, Vitamin E and Genistein, on oxidative stress resistance and longevity in genetically suppressed C. elegans under the stress of a hyperoxic environment. Groups of C. elegans were exposed to combinations of the following variables: different exposure times to a hyperoxic environment of 88.8-95.0% oxygen, different natural antioxidants, and a gene-suppressing plasmid. It was predicted that C. elegans in a hyperoxic environment that were treated with antioxidants and have stress proteins suppressed would experience an extended lifespan. Worms in a control environment, exposed to Genistein, and the Sod-2 plasmid experienced the longest lifespan. The Genistein flavonoid effectively supplemeneted the vital proteins of the Sod-2 gene, preventing damage by free radicals. The iRNA plasmid restricted the C. elegans from producing their own stress proteins, saving energy and increasing lifespan. If the effects of flavonoids and gene suppression in C. elegans holds true for humans, the result could be a new way to treat or prevent neurodegenerative diseases.

EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS ON THE HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN TILAPIA
Javed Asif Sayed
Homestead High School, Fort Wayne, IN, United States of America

Currently aquaculture, the science of cultivating fish for food, is the fastest growing industry in America. Across the United States farmers in the aquaculture industry are attempting to farm species of fish that are adapted to other environments. In Indiana for example, individuals are planning to farm tilapia, a species of fish that is naturally found in more southern latitudes. The exposure to colder water can cause stress, which is known to play a key role in the health of the animal. Stress is defined as any factor, which causes an organism to stray from homeostasis. I tested the validity of the following hypothesis: fish placed in the colder water would have a diminished immune response, as shown by a blood cell count. Over a period of 7 weeks this study found that fish which had been previously exposed to colder temperature in another study, had a lower number of white blood cells and thus a diminshed immune system.

THE EFFECTS OF A. PLANIPENNIS HABITAT DESTRUCTION ON THE POPULATIONS OF LIMNO-TERRESTRIAL TARDIGRADES RESIDING ON THE LICHENS OF F. PENNSYLVANICA
Ana Marie Lyons
Mecosta Osceola Math, Science & Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI, United States

The purpose of this study was to determine if alterations in abiotic resources associated with Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) habitat destruction affect the characteristics of local tardigrade populations. A field study was conducted at an Emerald Ash Borer infested and non-infested forest in central and west-central Michigan. A total of 80 lichen samples were collected from a series of 20 Green Ash trees (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) that were equally distributed between control and experimental sites. Lichen samples were hydrated for approximately 24 hours and were searched for microscopic life under low magnification. Amounts of tardigrades, nematodes, and other notable microscopic organisms were recorded and tardigrade specimens were later identified to species. Gross populations of tardigrades and nematodes were compared between sample sites with the use of a two-tailed equal variance t-test (alpha level 0.05) which generated a p-value of 0.0001 for tardigrades and 7.4946-24 for nematodes. Significant differences between populations of tardigrades located among Emerald Ash Borer infested and non-infested sites were found, rejecting the null hypothesis. Although the diversity of the tardigrades was primarily the same and consisted of the cosmopolitan species Ramazzottius baumanni, Milnesium tardigradum, Macrobiotus echinogenitus, and Macrobiotus cf. hufelandi, more tardigrades were observed during initial observational periods from samples extracted from the infested experimental site than from sampled extracted from the non-infested control site. These results suggest that differences in abiotic resources amongst habitats may influence tardigrade populations by affecting the rate of lichen growth on trees, especially with respect to environments experiencing biological invasions.

FOR THE BIRDS: TESTING THE EFFICACY OF SONIC AND ULTRASONIC BIRD DETERRENT DEVICES
Joanna Christine Guy
Southern Garrett High School, Oakland, Maryland, USA

While wind is an attractive source of clean and renewable energy, turbines threaten some sensitive bird and bat populations. This experiment sought to determine whether commercial sound devices are effective bird deterrents.<br><br> Research revealed that high frequency ultrasonic sound waves dissipate more rapidly than audible, lower frequency sound waves, especially in open areas. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a sonic deterrent device would prove most effective at repelling birds.<br><br> The procedure involved measuring the amount of seed consumed by birds from a backyard feeder during a 40-day test period under three conditions: 1) no sound deterrent installed for two 10-day control periods; 2) audible deterrent emitting an array of harassment sounds installed for 10 days; 3) ultrasonic deterrent installed for 10 days. Electronic devices were obtained on loan from a firm specializing in environmentally friendly bird control systems. Measurements were recorded during a five-hour period each morning.<br><br> Results of the study supported the hypothesis that the sonic deterrent device is a more effective repellent of bird activity than the ultrasonic device. This conclusion was validated by observational studies that recorded bird activity in the test area when no food source was present.<br><br> As a next step, efficacy testing of devices could be conducted on threatened species in planned or existing wind farm environments. If results are consistent with the present study, the findings could be incorporated into the design of bird- and bat-friendly wind turbines.<br><br>

THE BIG GREEN NUISANCE
Renee Jennifer Crane
Capac Junior/Senior High School, Capac, Michigan, United States

I predicted that the Emerald Ash Borer would prefer a specific specie of ash, Black Ash. Black Ash trees are one of the softest types of ash trees. Therefore the Emerald Ash Borer would be able to infest it easier than other ashes. To test my hypothesis, I went to a wooded area and counted the number of Emerald Ash Borer exit holes in different types of ash trees. These numbers would then tell me how many Emerald Ash Borer beetles had been in the tree the previous year. That way I could tell which specie of ash tree had the most, on average, number of Emerald Ash Borer infestations. If one specific type of ash tree had overall, the most exit holes, it would show that the Emerald Ash Borer favors a specific specie of ash tree.<br><br> Through my testing, I found that the Emerald Ash Borer does favor a specific specie, Black Ash with an average of sixteen exit holes per twenty by twenty-five centimeters. Black Ash, a softer, weaker, specie of ash is a perfect target for the Emerald Ash Borer. It is easier for an Emerald Ash Borer to eat its way through the wood of a Black Ash than the harder wood of other ashes. This project shows that certain species of ash need special attention. The Emerald Ash Borer has killed ten million ash trees and counting. Agriculturists need to know everything that might help control the population of the Emerald Ash Borer. <br><br>

DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS; A POSSIBLE EXPLIANATION FOR CORAL BLEACHING
Alessandra I Vaccaro
Campagna Academy Charter School, Schererville, IN, USA

Coral bleaching can be described as the general whitening of coral colonies due to the loss or reduction in density of the symbiotic zooxanthellae from the coral tissues. Bleaching in corals is usually considered an indicator of generalized stress to unfavorable environmental conditions such as high sea temperature or, perhaps, increased exposure to ultra violet light. Bleaching exposes the white calcium carbonate skeletons of the coral colony. Experiments show that one possible explanation for coral bleaching could be a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content of water. I compared the dissolved oxygen content of water under cold and warm conditions, with and without aeration. Also, tests were conducted to see how increased carbon dioxide levels would affect the dissolved oxygen levels under the same conditions.<br><br> The results indicate that when there is an increase in water temperature, there is a decrease in dissolved oxygen. This occurs in all tests; however, the decrease is greater in the warm water. Under conditions of increased carbon dioxide, there is a very great decrease in oxygen content, especially in the warm water. I am proposing that while increased water temperatures are indicators of the bleaching process, it is the subsequent drop in dissolved oxygen content that causes the bleaching.

DO EARTHWORMS HELP SPEED UP THE DECOMPOSITION PROCESS?
Martina Cotelo
Oxford Highschool, Oxford, MS, U.S.

My goal for this project was to discover if earthworms could help people with composting and recycling. My prediction was that if earthworms were added to kitchen residue then decomposition would speed up. I tested this by combining an equal amount of kitchen residue and potting soil into 10 2-liter bottles. I then punctured a hole in the upper section of the bottle. After, I attached plastic tubing to the hole and linked it to a water bottle. Then I securely sealed the tubing to a hole located at the bottom of the water bottle to provide a passage way for the gases released from the decomposition process to travel to the water bottle. Following, I filled the water bottle with water and placed it upside-down on a 7-inch deep tray filled with water. In this way I measured the amount of gases by using the water displacement method. Then I repeated these steps on the other 9 2-liter bottles. Once done, I added 15 worms to 5 of the bottles. The other five bottles were left worm-free as the control group.<br><br> After 30 days, the data showed worms were helpful with decomposition. The average of water displaced by the bottles with worms was 25.5 milliliters. However, the bottles lacking the worms averaged 17.5 milliliters. When comparing the bottles with the worms to the control bottles, there was a 41 percentage of increase in the water displaced in the bottles with the worms.

VARIATIONS IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IN TWO INBRED MOUSE STRAINS
Chenxia Monica Guan
Martin Luther King Academic Magnet School, Nashville, TN, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine if the sensory areas in the cerebral cortex differ between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. Since mice rely most heavily on their whiskers to gather information about the environment, the area of its somatosensory cortex (S1), receiving information from the whiskers, is the largest portion of the cortical sheet, followed by the visual cortex (V1), and then the auditory cortex (A1). Within the somatosensory cortex, there are subdivisions that represent different areas of the body, including a sub-area known as the posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF), which represents the mouse’s whiskers.<br><br> Studies before have compared the sensory areas in the cerebral cortex with those of other species, and have found that while the position of the sensory areas remains relatively constant, the size differs significantly depending on the animal. I hypothesized that there would be differences in the parcellation of the sensory cortices between inbred strains of mice.<br><br> To test this, boundaries of sensory areas were measured on pre-prepared brain sections (obtained from Vanderbilt University) stained with cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme that reveals areal boundaries. The results revealed significant differences between strains. C57BL/6J had a relatively larger neocortex and V1, whereas DBA/2J mice had a relatively larger PMBSF. Comparisons in shape between C57/BL6J and DBA/2J revealed a directional stretching of the map in C57BL/6J, compared to the more cramped arrangement of areas in DBA/2J. These findings are significant scientifically because they provide insight to further genetic studies and injury research.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE ON DUGESIA DOROTOCEPHATA
Kristen Marie Smith
Westview High School Martin, TN United States

The purpose of this expirement is to determine the effects of passive smoke on the memory of Dugesia dorotocephata. The hypothesis of this experiment is that passive smoke will affect the memory of Dugesia dorotocephata. <br><br> There were five(5) experimental groups and control groups in this project. Each group contained eight(8) planaria. The planaria for each group both, control and experimental, were randomly chosen. The control groups were out through the maze for a timed run daily. The experimental groups were each tested daily by increasing the puffs of smoke in their environment and then put through the maze for a timed run. Results of the control groups and experimental groups were compared in order to determine the effect of the passive smoke on the experimental groups. The results showed that there was a memory loss in the Dugesia dorotocephata which were exposed to various amounts of smoke, The time it took to complete the maze increased as the amount of smoke administered increased. The changes in the control group were not significant due to the absence of the smoke. <br><br> The Dugesia dorotocephata showed signs of memory loss after being exposed to passive smoke. These results show that passive smoke is detrimental to the memory of Dugesia dorotocephata. Since these results show memory loss in planaria, it is possible that passive smoke may also affect humans.

OLFACTION IN SOUTHERN GROUND HORNBILLS
Shahodat Neymatovna Hamraeva
Kapolei High School, Kapolei Hawaii, United States

The project, Olfaction in Southern Ground Hornbills, was done to test the sense of smell of hornbills. The aim was to see if they could locate the scent of their favorite food when it was hidden in one of two almost identical boxes. To keep the observer (Shahodat) from knowing which box had the scent and to pay the same attention to both of the boxes, the zookeeper spread the blood of mouse, chick or crushed mealworms inside a box that she labeled with one of the letters. After the two boxes (one with the scent and one without) were put inside the cage of the hornbills, the data was collected from two meters outside the cage. 15 observations were made 30 minutes for each session, over four month period. At the end, the letter of the box was recorded on the data table. After analysis, it was found that three of six behaviors that were used on the graph significantly showed (P value is < or = to 0.05) that the Southern Ground Hornbills had a sense of smell. Three of four hornbills chased other hornbills when they were near the box with the scent. It was inferred that the hornbills tried to keep other hornbills away from the box that they perceived to contain food. Indirectly, this seemed to indicate that they could discriminate between the boxes based on their sense of smell.

THE ROLE OF KELP HERBIVORES ON THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST INTERTIDAL TROPHIC CASCADE
Laurie Lea Fletcher
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, Oregon, USA

Within a trophic cascade, species can be labeled as producers, herbivores, and predators. All three are essential to the stable functioning of the trophic cascade. Producers provide energy for the herbivores and predators. Without herbivores, the producers will increase rapidly while the predators die out. If there are no predators, the herbivores will decimate the producers, which then causes a drastic reduction of herbivores. In the Pacific Northwest intertidal trophic cascade, numerous kelp species are the producers, with the most voracious herbivore being the sea urchin. Prior to European colonization, sea otters were the dominant predator on sea urchins, with each otter capable of consuming around 20 urchins per day. Today there are no sea otters left in Oregon. Declines in sea otters in waters off the coast of California, Washington, and Alaska have been blamed for an increase in urchins that has decimated kelp beds at greater depths. The objective of my study is to look at the amount of kelp that different intertidal herbivores consume to increase our knowledge of their role in the kelp-based intertidal trophic cascade. I conducted feeding experiments involving the kelps Alaria, Nereocystis, and Hedopyllum. I fed different parts of this kelp to purple sea urchins, black chitons, turban snails, kelp crabs, and hermit crabs. I found that urchins and kelp crabs eat the most of all kelp types. Further work is needed to determine if there are any marked kelp preferences.

THE DETERMINATION OF INTRASPECIFIC ALARM STRESS AND PREDATOR INDUCED STRESS BY USING SERUM HEMOLYMPH GLUCOSE LEVELS. YEAR THREE
Alexander Lynn Thurmon
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, MO,USA

The research was divided into two separate phases III and IV. Phase III was to determine if stress caused by intraspecific alarm chemicals released from a conspecific cheliped could be detected through serum glucose and activity levels. A cheliped was ground and filtered, the extract was used as the alarm chemical to warn other conspecific crayfish that there was possible trouble in the area. Fifty crayfish were divided in to a control group of seven crayfish and experimental groups of seven crayfish. The experimental crayfish were subjected to varying concentrations of the extract. The crayfish groups were observed for both activity levels (escape response) and serum hemolymph glucose levels. When analyzing the data the following results were obtained. For the activity level comparison between the control group and the experimental groups there was a highly significant difference observed. The glucose levels between the control group and the experimental found there was a highly significant difference in the blood glucose levels. Thus in both cases is seems that stress could be passed by alarm chemicals of a crayfish to a conspecific. <br><br> In Phase IV the intent of the research was to determine if molecules such as peptides extruded from a predator as well as visual stimulus from a predator would be enough to cause a stress response in Procambarus clarkii. As in phase III the crayfish were divided into control vs. experimental groups, activity levels as well as glucose levels were recorded. The difference between the control and experimental groups was highly significant. The results of this research indicate that crayfish are receptive to chemicals released by natural predators and respond to that with increased activity and stress levels.<br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF GROWTH ENHANCERS ON SUS SCROFA
Adam Lee Hubrig
Hankinson High School, Hankinson ND USA

Purpose: To compare the use of antibiotic (aureomycin) and a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) as feed additives for hogs.<br><br>Procedures: Separated 15 York Duroc Spot Cross pigs into three groups of five. The first group received the recommended amount of aureomycin, and the second group received the recommended amount of the Lactobacillus acidophilus, and the third received the standard feed as a control. <br><br>Weight Analysis: From the outset of the project, and every two weeks thereafter, each hog was weighed, during a ten week testing period. The amounts of feed that each test group received were also recorded.<br><br>Parasite Study: Every two weeks monitored the number of parasites found in three milliliters of a mixture produced from the feces of each group.<br><br>Bacteria Colonization: Weekly monitored the number of Escherichia coli colonies found in a mixture produced from the feces of each group. <br><br>Pathogen Study: Tested the additives and feed for inhibitory properties on eight pure cultures of bacteria. <br><br>Conclusion: Overall, both growth enhancers did indeed increase the growth rate and feed conversion of the hogs. However, the aureomycin test group seemed to become desensitized to the antibiotic and the antibiotic had less and less effect on the bacteria. Therefore, I would deter the use of the antibiotic supplement, and encourage the use of the probiotic.<br><br>

CELL PROLIFERATION IN EPISODIC AND PULSATILE DURING GROWTH OF ZEBRAFISH FINS
Isha H. Jain
Freedom High School, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

The zebrafish serves as an excellent paradigm for human morphological development. Its growth mechanisms offer useful insight into the bone development of various other species as well. In general, vertebrate growth may occur in two different modes-continuously or by saltation. The specific goal of this study was to establish which of these patterns determines bone growth in zebrafish.<br><br>Bone segments are added in a proximal to distal fashion in the caudal fin. The growth process was monitored by observing the rate of cell division in the mesenchymal compartment of individual rays with respect to segment length. Cell proliferation in 40 individual fins was detected by the incorporation of the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine, during DNA replication. For proper accounting, the dividing cells were observed in optical z-sections by confocal microscopy. The zns5 stain was used to determine the location of bone segments by staining osteoblasts. After the sequential zns5 staining failed, the BrdU protocol was modified to ensure that the original antigens were not destroyed by the use of hydrochloric acid.<br><br>The results show that macroscopic bone volume is linearly proportional to the total number of dividing cells integrated over the growth period of a given segment. Most importantly, for the first time, segment growth is shown to occur in periodic bursts at 50-70 micron intervals, rather than in a steady manner. Thus, growth may be induced by stimulators such as hormones. Future work is planned to analyze fin growth mutants and the gene expressions of associated growth markers.<br><br>

DETERMINING THE FILTRATION RATE OF THE MUSSEL ELLIPTIO COMPLANANTA
Sarah Elizabeth Hall, Samantha Garvin Carson
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, Georgia, United States of America

The aim of this study was to determine the filtration rate of the mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels are filter feeders, which means they filter their food along with pollutants from the water. In order to keep a river ecosystem healthy, mussels are required. By determining the quantity of water an individual mussel can completely clean and how much time it takes, an average number of mussels required could be established. If mussels are filtering out particulates in the water column and there is a measurable increase in light transmittance, then the data can be used to calculate an average filtration rate. In this experiment three separate trials were tested. Each trial was compared to a control set-up. The first two trials tested individual mussels in both distilled water with algae and natural creek water. The other trial tested ten mussels in creek water under a manmade steady current. Water samples were taken every hour for eight hours. A colorimeter measured the percent of light that could pass through each sample. By extrapolating the data until the percentage reached one hundred, the filtration rate was determined. With the trial testing the filtration of the creek water, the average filtration rate was 51 mL/hour. With the trail testing the filtration of distilled water with added algae, the average filtration rate for this trail was 68 mL/hour. Varied rates were determined, due to the variance in the substances being filtered, size of the mussels, and activeness of the mussels.

HOW DOES CAFFEINE AFFECT HAMSTERS?
Sarah Elizabeth Anderson, Sarah Elizabeth Whiteside
Charleston Catholic High School, Charleston, WV, USA

Caffeine is commonly known as a stimulant. There are many unknown factors regarding the effects of caffeine upon living organisms. We decided to test the effects of caffeine on hamsters because we became curious after learning of the effects on humans. We hypothesized that increasing amounts of caffeine causes increased activity levels in hamsters. We had three cages with three hamsters in each cage, and each cage received a different amount of caffeine. We tested the activity level by measuring the distance the hamsters ran using a hamster wheel and PhotoGate. Our control group received no caffeine, the middle group ingested .5 mg of caffeine five minutes prior to running, and the highest group ingested 1 mg of caffeine five minutes prior to running. We ran a total of 135 trials; each hamster did 5 trials in each group. In conclusion, the caffeine group ran significantly more than the no-caffeine group. <br><br> The increased distance by caffeinated hamsters proves that it does stimulate their system. This can help us because we could see if the relationship was found in humans as well; this could make hamster results a reliable prediction for the effects of caffeine on humans (this is valuable for soda and power drink company research). These results also provide groundwork for further investigation into the effects of caffeine.<br><br>

CAN SCENTED OILS BE USED EFFECTIVELY AS A PESTICIDE
Leigh Taylor Wamble, Sheila Elizabeth (Betsy) Mitchell, David Kells Parker
West Lauderdale High School, Collinsville, MS 39325

The purpose of this project was to experimentally determine the effectiveness of scented oils as an environmentally friendly pesticide against mosquitoes, termites, and fruit flies. Initially, we centrifuged five different oils; sweet mulberry, vanilla fragrance, cool cucumber, cinnamon spice and white gardenia. One milliliter of each of the two fractions was added to 200 mL of spring water. Mosquito eggs were added to the water and monitored for development into larvae. This process was repeated using mosquito larvae. To test the effects on termites, filter paper was soaked in each fraction of oil and added along with wood to each container. The containers were monitored for growth and reproduction. One milliliter was added to fruit fly media and placed into vials along with the flies. The flies were monitored for growth and reproduction. The control showed 82% to 94% of the eggs survived whereas 94% to 100% of the eggs placed in the oils did not. In the controls for the mosquito larvae, 86% to 96% of the larvae survived but the oils killed 90% to 100% of the larvae. The controls for the fruit flies produced a surviving rate of 78% to 98% for the fruit flies. The oils killed 80 to 94% of the fruit flies. The controls for the termites produced a survival rate of 80% to 90% while the oils killed 88% to 94% of the termites. Aromatic oils are a safe and effective replacement for common pesticides that may pollute the environment over time.

THE EFFECTS OF HEATED AND UNHEATED DISACCHARIDE SUBSTITUTES ON LIFESPAN, MORTALITY RATES, AND GENDER RATIOS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER DURING THE F-1 AND F-2 GENERATIONS
Stephanie Marie Hicks, Sara Clark
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX USA

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of various artificial sweeteners on the F-1 and F-2 generations of Drosophila melanogaster. Aspartame, sucralose, saccharin and sucrose were added to equal amounts of fly food as a dietary additive in concentrations of .01%, .001%, and .0001%. It was hypothesized that sucrose would be the least harmful additive, followed by sucralose. Aspartame was expected to be more harmful than sucralose, but less harmful to both male and female flies than saccharin. <br><br>All four experimental groups, as well as control, contained thirty fly tubes, each with one male and one female. Over a period of fourteen days mortality rates were monitored for F-1 generation, and F-2 generation flies were isolated. Lifespan and mortality rates for the F-1 generation were recorded, as were the male to female ratios of the F-2 generation. All experimental procedures were duplicated, this time heating the sweeteners to 45 degrees Celsius. Again, the mortality rates and lifespan were recorded for the F-1 generation, and, once isolated, the male to female ratios were recorded for the F-2 generation. <br><br>Results were collected and recorded for both generations and this data was analyzed using a statistical analysis program. The statistical analysis disproved the initial hypothesis and it was concluded that aspartame was the least harmful sweetener, followed by sucrose. Sucralose was slightly more detrimental than sucrose, but was not as harmful as saccharin.<br><br>

THE BEHAVIORAL AND BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AT THE HUNGER-BARRIERS OF MALE AND FEMALE HOUSE CRICKETS (ACHETA DOMESTICUS)
Thomas Kun Pak, Kwang-yul Kim, Duck Ju Kang
W. T Woodson High School, Fairfax VA, United States of America

The purpose of the project was to determine the effects of food-withdrawal on the motivation to acquire food and/or exert dominance from the same gender of male and female Acheta Domesticus (House Crickets). Food was withdrawn up to 48 hours from the 0.75-inch crickets (intervals of 4 hours). The 0.5-inch crickets were always deprived of food for 48 hours. In each interval, the bigger crickets were pitted against the smaller crickets. The bigger crickets exerted greater dominance in the competition of equal food-withdrawal-periods due to size. However, there were food withdrawal periods in which the bigger crickets were unsuccessful at exerting their dominance, and this is what is defined as a “hunger-barrier”. We discovered reoccurring hunger-barriers (mathematically equivalent to the local minimum of the sinusoidal function of the number of 0.75 inch cricket’s wins) for males, Y=0.129x+3.76*sin(0.273x+1.657)+15.824, and females, Y=0.01x+1.92*sin(0.44x-1.82)+17.62. In order to get an even more accurate point of the hunger-barrier, we tested in 1 hour intervals, 3 hours above and 3 hours below the located hunger-barrier. We discovered through standard deviation that the male and female crickets did not have significant differences. Furthermore, we measured the metabolic rates of the crickets at their hunger-barriers and found it to be higher than the general trend of metabolism (male: y=0.0322x+0.2513; females: y=0.0256x+0.1863). Because metabolism breaks down fuel into simple molecules, the crickets conserves its energy and thus loses its battles when metabolic rates are high. The behavioral and biological assessments strongly suggest that the hunger-barrier is an evolutionary stable strategy.

USE OF NILE RED IN DETERMINING LIPID ACCUMULATION IN DAF-2 AND WILD TYPE C. ELEGANS
Vasudha Gupta, Lana Tolen
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills, New York, United States of America

Regulation of body fat storage involves signaling between areas that normalize feeding in the brain and various sites of fat storage. Here, we describe a method for analyzing fat storage in Caenorhabditis elegans. Analyses of fat in Daf-2, a mutant with increased body fat resistant to environmental stress, were compared to Wild Type’s lipid accumulation under three temperatures (environmental stresses) 15oC, 25oC, 33oC. In order to visualize lipid droplets in the transparent roundworms, Nile Red was added to Escherichia coli, the diet of C. elegans, and subsequently absorbed by the worms to intestinal cells. The intentions were to determine varying amounts of lipid deposits under different temperature settings in order to find a connection between the lipid accumulation and a protein, Heat Shock Protein (HSP). The significance of HSP, released as a response to heat, is that it repairs and eliminates dysfunctional cells, which correspond to chemical pathways and insulin receptors that store fat. There is a direct relationship between longevity and stress resistance, which suggests that an escalated release of HSP leads to increased life span. Through use of an electrophoresis comparison and photo-microscopy, it was demonstrated that the amounts of fat accumulation and HSP varied under different temperatures. The results showed that there were distinct differences in lipid accumulation, as well as in the protein bandings of Daf-2 and Wild Type under the three temperature settings. From the electrophoretic results, it may be speculated that the presence of HSP is more prevalent in Daf-2 than in Wild Type.

CADMIUM EFFECT ON THE HOLOTHURIA GLABERRIMA VISCERAL REGENERATION
Alexander Santiago-Llorens, Cesar O. Perez-Colon, Gerardo M. Guasp-Perez
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, Puerto Rico

Everyday, people are exposed to Cadmium throughout different ways. Considered as a plausible carcinogenic element, it is intended through this investigation, to observe if cadmium will affect the natural process of the H.glaberrima visceral regeneration. Fourteen sea cucumbers were collected and submitted to experimentation at the laboratory. The experimental sea cucumbers were all eviscerated at the same time and divided into four different groups, which were then exposed to cadmium at diverse stages of the visceral regeneration process. The first group was exposed to the cadmium solution right after the evisceration process culminated. The second group was exposed to the cadmium three days postevisceration (dPE). The third group was exposed after six dPE, and the fourth group was exposed after nine dPE. Following the fourteen days required for a normal eviscerated sea cucumber to regenerate its intestines, the remaining subjects were sacrificed to gather data on the resulting regeneration. It was hypothesized that the visceral regenerative natural process would be severely affected by demonstrating growth anomalies on the viscera, if cadmium was to be added during diverse stages of the regeneration process. The first group would be the most affected in its regenerative process, after the exposure to cadmium; followed by the subsequent groups in order of exposure. Results demonstrate that the first two experimental groups expired at cost of its early exposure to cadmium; the remaining two groups show that the cadmium harshly affected the regeneration process in contrast to the control group which completed the normal process.

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation done to study the effect of chinaberry (Melia azedarach)fruit extract oil on Plutella xylostella (DBM)larvae.The initial idea was to find a method by which we can control the devastrating moth.In recent years this moth has developed resistance to most of the chemical insecticides and even biological insecticides. Still the scientists and reserchers are trying to find a method to control this moth. <br><br> For this purpose we collected dry chinaberry fruits, crushed them and extracted oil using soxhelet apparatus,then we diluted the extracted oil with water and emulsifiers and studied the effect of extracted oil on feeding, growth and fecundity of DBM larvae.<br><br> We reared DBM larvae in incubator and then allowed them to feed on cabbage leaves dipped in the sol. of different conc. of the oil.<br><br>We studied different aspects of DBM larvae including mortality rate, eggs laid by the moth, percentage hatchability, pupal weight etc.<br><br> Our experiments concluded that 4% concentration of test sol. is found to be most effective in controlling this moth. by treating this moth to 4% conc. of test sol.we got the following results:<br><br>1)mean leaf area consumption decreased to 0mm 2)mortality rate was increased to 90% 3)pupal weight, percentage emergence and adult longevity decreased in a dose dependent manner.<br><br> The contribution of this project are in two folds. Firstly we found a method by which we can contol this moth.Secondly the product is completely bionatural,easily available, cheap, it does not cause any harm to the soil, plants and consumer. It is also environmental friendly and has no biological hazardous.<br><br>

SEXUAL SELECTION IN DROSOPHILA: A BEHAVIORAL, MORPHOLOGICAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC STUDY
Benjamin Alan Pollack, Abhinav Khanna
Plainview Old Bethoage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, New York, US

Species of the genus Drosophila exhibit a fascinating diversification of male specific courtship behavior displays, and have historically been the focus of much discussion in sexual selection and speciation literature (Mayr, 1946; Spieth, 1951; Markow, 1981; Kaneshiro, 1983; Carson, 2002). <br><br> The first part of this two-phase study examines the role of wing spots in mating. In Drosophila biarmipes, males exhibit distinct wing melanin patterns, known as wing spots, which coordinate with a distinct wing display behavior during courtship (Kopp and True, 2002). This study examines the effect of wing spots on mating success by using no-choice and single choice mating tests. The second phase of this study examines sexual selection on island populations of Drosophila melanogaster to determine mating propensities on islands as opposed to the widely studied mainland (cosmopolitan) locations by using multiple choice mating tests. <br><br> The findings of this study yielded a more complete understanding of how behavioral, morphological, and geographical traits influence sexual selection in D. melanogaster and D. biarmapes. Females of the D. biarmipes species show a strong preference for males with wing spots. This suggests that the wing spots evolved and are maintained by sexual selection. D. melanogaster populations in the Bahamas are showing significant non-random mating with mainland USA populations and exhibit the beginning stages of sexual isolation, while results suggest that there is no isolation among D. melanogaster from within the same geographical location. Early stages of incipient speciation were evident. This study suggests that island populations might have differentiated enough in male traits for the evolution of female local preference.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF TOBACCO EXTRACT ON FIRES ANTS
Bryan Garcia, Mildelis Martinez
Marcelino Rodriguez Roman School, Moca, Puerto Rico

Previous research has revealed that tobacco extracts stimulate and cause depressive effects on human beings. The purpose of this project is to investigate if tobacco extracts stimulate or affect in a depressive manner Solenopsis geminate known as fire ants.<br><br> For the purpose of this study, Petri plates were used; each one containing different concentrations of the tobacco extract of dry leaves. Petri plate number one served as the control group. It contained only distilled water. The numbers of dead ants were observed during a determined period of time.<br><br> The findings of this investigation demonstrated that in the plate with the highest concentration of tobacco extract the ants not only died at a faster rate but also the number of dead ants increased.<br><br> The contribution of this research is evident. The extract of the tobacco dry leaves demonstrated that it is not only useful as an ant population reducer, but, it also avoids contaminating the environment. Future studies should be conducted separating the different chemical components of the tobacco extracts, in order to reveal which of these cause the ants’ death. Research should also be carried out to discover if it is useful in the control of other insects’ populations.<br><br>

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WEB STRUCTURES IN ORB-WEB BUILDING SPIDERS
Doo Young Lee, Gil Young Park
Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Hoengsung-gun, Kangwon-do, Korea(ROK)

This project was conducted to formulate and analyze spider webs mathematically by using coordinates. Although the structural applications of spider webs are promising, little research has been done to provide a foundation for computer simulation. Thus, this study will set the basis for practical utilization of web structures. <br><br> We formulized the functions of ellipses which circumscribe polygon-shaped spirals as well as the linear functions of radii from 38 spider webs. By connecting the intersections between the ellipses and the radii, we modeled spider webs. We proved that the difference between each pair of corresponding points of the actual and the modeled spider webs is minute, with an average deviation(the difference divided by half length of major axis) of 0.0357.<br><br> <br><br> We also analyzed the structural characteristics of the spider webs mathematically, intending to verify the previous theories and derive new rules regarding the orb-web structures. We calculated the areas and centroids of polygon-shaped spirals as well as the areas and eccentricities of the ellipses that circumscribe the spirals. We verified a previous theory that the lower-halves of orb-webs are larger than the upper-halves. We also found that the y-coordinates in centroids of web polygons are smaller than zero, that the lower-halves have more radii than the upper-halves, and that the ratio of area to circumference increases as the spider webs come to resemble perfect circles. <br><br> Our approach, which uses the functions of radii and spirals, is unique and useful for precise mathematical analysis and computer-based modeling of the spider web structures.

STOCHASTIC/DETERMINISTIC ANALYSIS OF ARBOVIRAL TRANSOVARIAL TRANSMISSION IN CULICIDAE
Gabriel Joel Mendoza, Fredrick Rojas
Americas High School, El Paso TX, United States

Due to the rapid evolution of West Nile Virus (WNV), new WNV transmission phenomena are beginning to occur in high-risk localities around the world. One such phenomenon is the process of transovarial transmission of WNV in Culicidae (mosquitoes). Transovarial transmission is the passing of a disease from the female parent mosquito directly to its offspring. It is hypothesized that the effect of an established transovarial transmission ability within mosquitoes would be an increased prevalence of infected vectors, thus elevating the danger to humans.<br><br> Increased research into the ecology and prevention of transovarial transmission is warranted. The overall scope of this project is to conduct experimental research on methods to prevent the widespread establishment of arboviral transovarial transmission. These methods can be incorporated into a more effective IMM (Integrated Mosquito Management) program.<br><br> In order to test our hypothesis, mosquito adults, larvae, and egg rafts from a county of West Texas were collected and analyzed. Three novel methods for detecting transovarial transmission prevalence in the field were tested and standardized. Incorporating baseline data of a broader region, new methods of analysis and prevention were developed by utilizing deterministic, stochastic, and system dynamic analyses.<br><br> After analyzing over 11,000 personally collected mosquitoes, 80,000 mosquitoes collected in joint-cooperation with a local Vector Control, and the historical data of millions of mosquitoes collected in Texas, an improved transovarial transmission IMM protocol was developed that will be of invaluable help in suppressing this current WNV epidemic, and future, potentially more devastating ones.<br><br>

COMPETITION BETWEEN CO-EXTENSIVE HOMOLOGOUS EFFERENT TERMINALS DURING SYNAPSE MATURATION
Erin N. McCormick, Rupal H. Patel
Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan, U.S.A.

During neural circuit assembly synaptic inputs must develop such that the sites of action are functionally appropriate. Where multiple efferents make synapses in the same target area, we predict that there would be mechanisms to insure complete innervation at an optimal density. In the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, bilaterally paired heart tubes (HT) are co-innervated by two distinct FMRFamide+ immunoreactive neurons. HE motor neurons and HA modulatory neurons and the innervation territories of segmentally homologous HEs overlap such that 3-4 overlapping efferents innervate each segment.<br><br>We tested the hypothesis that multiple efferents were in competition for a limited supply of target-derived synapse maturation factor(s). We used leeches that had surgical ablations performed at early stages of leech development (embryonic day 9-10) to generate animals with isolated CNS in a midbody segment (segment 10), with and without central rhythmic entrainment of the target muscle (HT). <br><br>HT innervation was visualized at the end of embryogenesis using anti-acetylated tubulin (ACT) and anti-FMRFamide (FMRF). FMRF+ varicosities were counted blindly in digital images, and results reported are number of varicosities/homologous target location. Isolated efferents in preparations without centrally entrained activity showed failure of synapse maturation with 17 varicosities (average) compared to 61 in unoperated controls. When the central pattern generator was intact, the isolated HE generated 72 varicosities. Thus, the synapses from the isolated HE matured and completely compensated for the loss of overlapping innervation. These results strongly support the hypothesis that innervation density is normally regulated by competitive interactions among coextensive nascent terminals.

GENETIC DIVERSITY OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOATS (OREAMNOS AMERICANUS) THROUGH NONINVASIVE MICROSATELLITE GENOTYPING
Forrest Connell Jessop, Jeremy Reynoso, Alissa Schlecht
Corvallis High School, Corvallis MT, USA

The Rocky Mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) migrates according to the seasons in mountainous regions. Very little research on genetic relations between Rocky Mountain goats has been done. In this novel study, two populations of mountain goats in the Beartooth and Bitterroot mountains were monitored for heterozygosity and allelic frequency. Heterozygosity between populations and individuals was determined by examining the number of base pairs located on various microsatellites markers. PCR was used to cross amplify bovine, ovis, and rangifer (caribou) microsatellites in local mountain goat populations. Invasive sampling is difficult when dealing with mountain goats due to their natural habitat. Noninvasive isolation of DNA from stool samples provided a viable means of obtaining DNA. Electrophoresis in high percentage agarose gels allowed for the differentiation of bovine and goat alleles. Results obtained by this research can further benefit future studies on genetic structure and population management of the mountain goat.

The Paraguay - Parana River system is a the second largest in South America. Along its 3,000 Km North-South course it traverses through different ecoregions - Amazon rainforest, Parana rainforest, Cerrado, Chaco, Espinal and Pampas.<br><br>In this work we study the regional avifauna at a site on the lower section of the Paraguay River Valley, in Formosa province.<br><br>Throughout 2005 field prospecting was done weekly, identifying species and obtaining information on relative abundance, migrations and habitat. Information gathered during 2003 was also used. Observation were made with binoculars aided by birdsong recordings.<br><br>The site proved to have a great diversity, with 270 species (57% of the species mentioned for Formosa and 27% of the species of Argentina), rich in water birds and a high number of migrants from the northern hemisphere (15 species, nearly 30% of the total reaching Argentina). Five species were found in the area that are considered globally threatened with extinction, and eight that are endangered at a national level. A special highlight was the discovery of the largest population in Argentina of Peach-fronted Parakeets(Aratinga aurea), endangered at a national level. Several identified species had not previously been recorded here, demonstrating the importance of this waterway as a biological corridor for the region. The information gathered during this work led to the inclusion of this area as an IBA (Important Bird Area) in following with the Birdlife guidelines.
