POSITIONING APPLIANCE FOR DIRECT ALIGNMENT OF DENTAL X-RAYS
Katie Elizabeth Libich
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, USA

The over exposure to radiation, can cause dental patients serious health issues in the future. Dentistry has created a lead-blocking device for their x-ray machine called the universal collimator. It has an opening exactly the size of the film so there is no excess exposure in which reduces the exposure by fifty percent. The problem with the device is that it is hard for dental hygienists and assistants to directly align the collimator with the film inside the patient's mouth. This creates misaligned x-rays, which misses the entire area of purpose, making the whole procedure useless. In this experiment, I designed an appliance that would directly line up the film inside the mouth with the collimator opening, using plastic tubes and an alignment piece that would show where the film was positioned. When the device was put to use, using an actual dental x-ray machine, the percent of error calculated, after exposure, showed that it appeared to be useful. The x-rays that were taken using the appliance had some degree of error, possibly due to the accidental sliding of the alignment piece or the patient moving right before the x-ray was exposed, throwing off the alignment that was set. I feel that dentistry could greatly benefit from this appliance, as long as there were someway to prevent the alignment piece from moving, which will be researched in the continuation of this project.<br><br>

HERBAL REMEDIES: A BACTERIAL STUDY
Barbara Kate Snowden
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, Florida, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to show if herbal remedies are capable of combating infections caused by bacteria. Aloe, barberry, chamomile, licorice, and tea tree were tested on S. aureus. Aloe, barberry, cinnamon, dill, and garlic were tested on E. coli. <br><br> To carry out this experiment, two grams each of the dry herbs were placed in individual beakers with 40 ml of boiling water and six sterile paper disks. Twenty ml each of aloe juice and tea tree oil were placed in separate test tubes along with 6 paper disks each. Twenty-four hours later, agar plates were labeled and eight were each inoculated with a different herb (for controls). Suspensions of E. coli and S. aureus were made and agar plates were inoculated. The herb-soaked paper disks were placed on the agar dishes, saving two plates for bacterial controls. Twenty-four hours later, results were recorded.<br><br> None of the herbs tested inhibited E. coli. Only tea tree fully killed S. aureus. However, in one experiment, barberry showed a slight area of less bacteria growth, as did licorice, chamomile, and aloe. Bacterial controls were successful. On the herbal controls, barberry, chamomile, dill, garlic, and licorice all had growth of common bacilli bacteria.<br><br> In conclusion, although tea tree was not tested on E. coli, it is highly likely that it would also kill E. coli because of bacterial similarities. Because of slight inhibition of S. aureus bacteria on four experiments, these herbs may have slight antibacterial qualities. Although resident bacteria in herbs are common, they may have affected the outcome of the experiment.<br><br>

A GEOMETRICALLY AND MECHANICALLY REALISTIC REPLACEMENT MITRAL VALVE
Kyra Lauren Sedransk
Hathaway Brown, Shaker Heights, Ohio, USA

Since the middle of the 20th century mitral valve replacement has been one way of combating a variety of mitral valve diseases. Currently, there are two categories of replacement valves available but neither has been drastically changed since inception. Additionally, due to the outdated designs neither adequately represents the normal mitral valve. Both the mechanical valves and the bioprosthetic valves fail to include the structure and geometry of a normal mitral valve. So to design a better replacement mitral valve a technique for analyzing the mitral valve structure was invented and the data was then collected. The research led to GMRV, the geometrically and mechanically realistic (replacement mitral) valve. This replacement mitral valve is an improvement because first and foremost it accounts for flaws and failures in previous models, which were designed on old research. In addition, it incorporates the new research regarding the mitral valve including the geometry, structure, and biomechanical properties. <br><br>

IS YOUR CHILD REALLY SAFE?
Kris Ryan Hendricks, Wilcox-Hildreth Public School
404 E. Sapp St. Wilcox, NE, 68982 USA

Pacifiers encourage health and oral development; however, they can also be a breeding ground for bacteria. There are many different cleaning techniques that can be used if parents take the time to read the label directions correctly. The purpose of my research is to determine which cleaning technique eliminates the most bacteria. I will also test putting a clean pacifier in a typical environment of germs to see if the sterile pacifier will become contaminated with germs. <br><br> I hypothesize that the boiling technique will eliminate the most bacteria. <br><br> Four different colored sterile pacifiers will be purchased. Bacillis subtilis will be placed on each of the four nipples. A total of seven different cleaning techniques will be used. These techniques will consist of boiling, wiping on clothing, washing with water, washing with soap and water, cleaning with a baby wipe, heating in a microwave, and cleaning them with mouth wash. The seven different cleaning techniques will then be repeated twenty times. Standard deviation will also be performed to determine the accuracy of each cleaning technique.<br><br> Seven different cleaning techniques were evaluated. Two techniques, boiling in water, and cleaning with a baby wipe, significantly lowered the bacterial contamination. The silicone pacifier always contained the most bacteria. Wiping the pacifier on your clothing does not get rid of much bacteria at all, only foreign particles. Pacifiers that were only cleaned with water didn’t remove that much bacteria at all. My hypothesis was correct. Boiling the pacifiers in water removed all of the bacteria.

THE USE OF EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAGS (EST) EXPRESSION PROFILING AS A POSSIBLE TOOL FOR PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS
Megan Elizabeth Muroski
Lake Highland Prep, Orlando Fl, USA

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Several treatments include radial prostatectomy, radiation/chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. The most widely diagnostic method used is the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test; however, previous research has shown that PSA is not "prostate specific." Molecular biology research has lead the way in the search for better diagnostic markers not only in prostate cancer, but in other diseases as well.<br><br>The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether EST expression profiling could be used to diagnose prostate cancer. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a small section of DNA with unknown function. A semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was preformed using total RNA extracted from prostate cancer model cell line models with different phenotypic characteristics. The expression profiles of five human ESTs were assessed by the use of sequence specific primers as well as 18S rRNA primers as an internal control.<br><br>Two of the five ESTs results demonstrated a possible down-regulatory correlation between the expression levels of the EST and progression of prostate cancer. Through Southern Blotting of patient samples and the use of semi-quantification of RT-PCR, seven out of nine patient samples show down-regulatory expression. It can be concluded that the hypothesis was supported; the EST expression patterns have demonstrated the potential to be used for diagnostic purposed in prostate cancer.<br><br>

ALL ABOUT ERK
Anna Chloe Farkas, Beaumont School 
Cleveland Heights, OH. USA

The use of alcohol during pregnancy is a serious issue. Drinking during pregnancy has been directly linked to specific birth defects and neurodevelopmental defects. Perhaps the most prevalent health risk for an alcohol-exposed fetus is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FAS affects many aspects of the developing fetal nervous system. There are many similarities between people who are affected with FAS and people who have a mutation on the gene that produces L1, a cell adhesion molecule. Because of the similarities between FAS affected people and people with L1 mutations, there is reason to investigate the mechanisms and functions of L1. Prior research suggests that L1 mediates neurite outgrowth of developing fetal cells. A signal transduction pathway activates L1. The last step of this pathway is the phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular regulated kinase). ERK is essential for neurite outgrowth and previous research indicates that ethanol inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK. This experiment begins to establish methodology for identification of ERK by immunoprecipitating L1. In one of the three samples tested, ERK was positively identified using this method. There are several possible sources of error, which include incorrect dilutions of primary antibodies, the absence of a control, and no available dose response curve with which to compare results. This experiment is important because it begins to prove that ERK can be identified for further study of its mechanism and its role in the activation of L1. Additional information about L1 increases the hope that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome may one day be remedied.

DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTION OF RETINAL GANGLION AXONS TO THE BRAIN
Ning Zhou
Wayzata High School, FSDP c/o ISD 287, Plymouth, Minnesota, USA 

Evidence is lacking about how connections between the eye and the brain are established for vision. The study purpose was to investigate the development of the route via which visual information is transferred from the eye to the brain. Methods: Chick embryos were used. On embryonic day nine, 0.25 microliter of 10% dialkylcarbocyanine, a fluorescent chemical dye, was injected into a small portion of the retina in the right eye to trace the projection of retinal ganglion axons to the brain. On embryonic day ten, the tectum, a visual center in the brain, and the retina in the eye were removed from embryos and examined for the distribution of dialkylcarbocyanine-labeled retinal ganglion axons with a fluorescence microscope. The results showed that retinal ganglion axons from the right eye only projected to the left tectum of the brain, and that ganglion axons from the temporal side of the right eye projected to the anterior tectum while ganglion axons from the nasal side projected to the posterior tectum. The distribution of retinal ganglion axons in the tectum did not conform to a Poisson model (P < 0.001), suggesting a topographic pattern. Thus, the development of eye-brain connections occurred at least as early as embryonic day nine, and a topographic pattern of retinal ganglion axon projections was seen. These findings provide an anatomic basis for vision processing. Future research will use this model to investigate underlying mechanisms behind how a topographic projection of retinal ganglion axons to the brain develops.

DIFFERENTIATION OF RN33B CELLS INTO CHOLINERGIC NEURONS IN VITRO
Jessica Pearl Swartz
Jefferson High School, FSDP c/o ISD #287, Bloomington, MN, USA,

The past decade unleashed a great deal of discoveries regarding neural stem cells. The RN33b line of cells is a clonal line of cells derived from the medullary raphe nucleus of an adult rat that was encoded with a retro virus, causing temperature sensitivity. RN33b cells have been found to differentiate specific to the site of transplantation in the central nervous system. RN33b cells were grafted into the brain of an infant mouse and differentiated into astrocytes, as shown by immunohistochemical staining. Because cells grafted in vivo did not differentiate into cholinergic neurons, in vitro testing was necessary. RN46A cells are closely related to RN33b cells and have successfully specialized into cholinergic neurons in vitro. Cholinergic neurons are the neurons that deplete in early Alzheimer’s Disease and contribute to function and memory. It was important to determine whether RN33b cells can also exhibit cholinergic properties in vitro for possible cell therapies in the future. Differentiation media contained the N2 supplement to support neural cells and were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius. Signs of successful differentiation included translucent, round bodies with slim processes extending from the cell body. These traits were consistent with normal neural morphology. Immunocytochemical staining was performed to determine expression of cholinergic markers before and after differentiation. Results showed neurons in vitro and were on the path of becoming cholinergic neurons. Future research includes the application of various growth factors such as CNTF and other substrates, such as cholinine and laminine, to the cell line in order to potentially generate cholinergic neurons. These cells would be grafted into the brain of a mouse modeled with Alzheimer's Disease as the variable and a healthy mouse as a control.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FOLIC ACID, HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE
Tristan Emil Gonzalez-Sanz
Dunbar High School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

The purpose for this experiment is to document the interaction of folic acid with homocysteine levels. The levels of homocysteine in the body can be measured by the blood pressure of the test animal. There is a correlation between elevated homocysteine levels and hypertension. Additionally, lower homocysteine levels lead to lower blood pressure.<br><br>The experiment consisted of three test samples. The samples consisted of twelve female white mice. Each sample was given a varying degree of folic acid. The first test group (Sample A) received 300% of the recommended daily dosage. The second group (Sample B) was given 150% of the recommended daily dosage. The third group (Sample C) received no folic acid. <br><br>Note: The daily dosage was calculated by comparing the body masses of the average human and the average mouse with the daily recommended dosage of folic acid for humans. The increase was made because mice have a higher metabolism, and would therefore pass the folic acid through their body at a faster rate. Additionally, the results would be easier to observe in larger amounts. <br><br>Please see Procedure page for further information. <br><br>The systolic blood pressure of every mouse was recorded daily for a period of two weeks. From the recordings it is apparent that there is a .18% decrease in systolic pressure in Sample A and a .07% decrease in Sample B. These results show a correlation between folic acid, homocysteine levels, and blood pressure.<br><br>

INVESTIGATION INTO BIOGENIC LIVER RESOURCES
Emery C Lin
Gainesville High School, Gainesville, FL, United States

When liver failure occurs, the only option for the patient is a liver transplant. Today, approximately 16,000 patients await liver transplants. Annually, over 4,000 transplantations are performed, while nearly 2,000 patients die awaiting a liver transplant. One possible solution involves creating a bio-artificial liver to allow patients to survive while waiting for a donor organ. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) could be grown on an artificial scaffold for an extended period of time, while maintaining viability and function.<br><br>Primary hepatocytes and NPCs were seeded onto glass scaffolds and cultured in Hepatocyte Growth Medium, supplemented with Hepatocyte Growth Factor. Culturing these cells for up to 2 months, MTT Assays were performed to determine cell viability and density of the cells. Hematoxylin and Eosine (H&E) staining was used to determine cellular morphology, while immunohistochemistry for Albumin and AE-1 was used to determine cell type.<br><br>MTT Assays demonstrated that cultured cells grew and stayed viable on the glass scaffolds for extended periods of time. However, H&E staining revealed the majority of the cells growing were NPCs and only a small portion of the hepatocytes managed to survive and grow in a three-dimensional structure. Based on our findings that hepatic cells grew on these scaffolds, further research using other types of scaffolds (i.e. collagen, OPLA, etc.) should be pursued to optimize the system for creating a bio-artificial liver that serves as an alternative for hepatic dialysis until an organ-transplant can be performed.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ON HUMAN BLOOD
Lev A. Shaket
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, Georgia, U.S.A

The research project's problem questioned how exposure time of human blood to Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF EMFs) at 50 mG affects its chemical substances, blood cells, and blood clotting. It was chosen to prove the harmful effects of ELF EMFs. The hypothesis stated as the exposure time of human blood to ELF EMFs increases, potassium, sodium, enzymes (LDH and AST), magnesium, phosphorus, iron, total protein, and albumin should increase, and calcium should decrease in the serum; erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets should decrease, and erythrocyte morphology should show hypochromia and poikilocytosis; coagulation time should increase. Collected blood was exposed to ELF EMFs for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The blood specimens were then tested for chemistry, hematology, and coagulation by corresponding analyzers. Trendline graphs relating normal ranges were made for each component, percentage increases/decreases were calculated, and a final cumulative graph was made according to this data. In addition, blood smears for each time period were prepared and examined. The data showed that total protein, albumin, LDH, AST (trendline), calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and sodium increased, but potassium and Ca++ decreased; erythrocytes, leukocytes (trendline), and platelets decreased; prothrombin coagulation time increased. Erythrocyte morphology showed a gradual change from normochromic, normocystic erythrocytes to those inflicted with a minor degree of hypochromia(1+) and poikilocytosis(1+). Future applications include a more sophisticated understanding of the harms of ELF EMFs leading to government precautions against them.

THE PREVALENCE OF EHRLICHIOSIS IN DOGS FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST
Carrie Calkins Rethlefsen
Winona Senior High School, Winona Minnesota, USA

Purpose: Ehrlichia are small, gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria in the family Rickettsiaceae. Ixodes spp., Amblyomma americanum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks transmit Ehrlichia spp. to primarily dogs, horses, or humans as they take a blood meal. Determining the prevalence of dog infections with ehrlichiosis agents will provide valuable information for area veterinarians. The results may also clarify the risk of ehrlichiosis in humans in the same study areas.<br><br>Sensitivity Testing: Samples of normal dog blood were spiked with serial dilutions of a positive control plasmid. The samples were run by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), run out by gel electrophoresis, stained, and analyzed. The results of the sensitivity testing showed that you could detect ehrlichiosis out to 10-8 and there was a 58.4 molecules/target sensitivity. Prevalence Testing: Twenty-four dog blood samples were collected by venous puncture in EDTA tubes from local veterinarians from southeastern Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin. The samples were taken from sick and healthy dogs along with a questionnaire being filled out. The samples were then tested by nested PCR to determine the presence of ehrlichiosis. The samples were run through a thermocycler, then run out on electrophoresis gels, and photographed. Results: One of the twenty-four dogs that were tested was positive for ehrlichiosis infection. Compared to the non-ehrlichiosis dogs, the infected dog was unique in carrying 14 ticks and having the symptom of a high fever at 105.3°F. This is the first confirmed case of ehrlichiosis infection in dogs from this region. <br><br>

A COMPARISON OF STRESS FIBER FORMATION AND CELL MIGRATION IN HUMAN NSCLC AND EMBRYONIC LUNG CELLS
Ashley Jean Malcolm
Perham High School, Perham, MN, United States

Recently it was discovered that G-proteins activate proteins in the Ras/MAPK pathway. This suggests a potential role of G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs) in regulating cell growth and triggering cancer. My research investigated the ability of GPCR agonists to cause stress fiber formation in human non-small cancer lung cells (NSCLC) and human embryonic lung cells. Stress fibers are actin filaments formed in the cytoplasm that attach to proteins in the plasma membrane and play an important part in cellular movement. The attachment of actin filaments and the elongation of stress fibers appear to be an integral part of cell migration. The agonists used in this study were: 1) Lysophophatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid that is a major growth factor in serum; 2) Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), an extracellular protease that binds to a membrane receptor to activate MAPK signaling; 3) Phenylephrine (PE), a norepinephrine analog that stimulates intracellular signaling through protein kinase C; 4) Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a molecule that mimics diacylglycerol and activates protein kinase C. The hypothesis is that stress fibers will be stimulated by PMA and LPA, but not from PE and uPA. Stress fiber formation was measured by staining the actin filaments using fluorescein conjugated phalloidin. This research discovered that human NSCLC acted similar to unstimulated embryonic lung cells and that the same signaling pathways were responsible for controlling stress fiber formation in both cell types. This is significant because the cancer cells seem to mimic the more migratory embryonic cells that would increase metastasis.

YOUR CHOICE: PEPSI OR COKE? SODA'S EFFECT ON TOOTH ENAMEL
Evan Michael White
John Paul II, Tallahassee, Florida, The United States of America

The purpose of this project was to determine which soda, Coke or Pepsi, would cause the greatest damage to tooth enamel. In this case, the types of damage referred to are discoloration and deterioration of the tooth's enamel. The hypothesis was that Pepsi would cause more damage than Coke because of its greater sugar content.<br><br> The procedure for the experiment was to set up two groups of hard-boiled eggs. Each group contained eight eggs. Eggs were used in this experiment because their shells are made of calcium like tooth enamel. Eggs were rated according to their color and weighed with a triple beam balance. Each egg was placed in a cup that was filled with 150 milliliters of either Coke or Pepsi and then refrigerated for twenty-four hours. At that time, the eggs were weighed and change in discoloration noted. This took place over six twenty-four hour intervals.<br><br> After experimentation, the recorded data partially supported the hypothesis. In general, the eggs that were submerged in Pepsi suffered the greatest weight loss and deterioration. On the other hand, the hypothesis was partially rejected because, in general, the eggs that were submerged in Pepsi had less extrinsic staining than that of Coke. The results of this experiment suggest that drinking Coke over Pepsi would be safer for your teeth. However, due to the greater extrinsic staining produced by Coke, frequent tooth brushing would be recommended.

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SODA PRODUCTS ON MAMMAL TEETH? PHASE II
Jonathan William Parramore
Union Grove High School, McDonough, GA, USA

The purpose of this project was to compare the effect of different soda products on the loss of mass of mammal teeth. The hypothesis was two parts: (1) Mammal teeth tested with diet soda will have a greater loss of mass than the mammal teeth tested with regualar soda; (2) The lower the pH of the soda product, the greater the loss of mass of the mammal teeth.<br><br> Mammal teeth were obtained from a taxidermist. The teeth were autoclaved at 121 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes to destroy pathogens. Five trials were preformed on the teeth using 11 different soda types and water as a control. The teeth were massed, placed in the soda product for 24 hours, removed, dried for 2 hours in a drying oven and massed again. The pH of each solution was determined with a pH probe.<br><br> Results of the data showed that darker sodas lost more mass than the light sodas. Research found that the dark sodas contain phosphoric acid for flavoring and the light sodas contain citric acid for flavoring. The phosphpric acid is a mineral acid that extracts the calcium from the tooth. The loss of percentage of mass was compared for the regular sugar soft drinks to the diet soft drinks. The phosphoric acid drinks had more percentage mass loss in the regular drinks and the light colored drinks had more percentage mass loss in the diet. The pH had no affect on the loss of mass of the soda products on the mammal teeth. <br><br>

HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME AND MEMORY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
Christopher F Recinella
Baker County High School, Glen St. Mary, FL

Schizophrenia, which affects approximately 1% of the world population, is divided equally among the sexes. Symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Onset can occur as early as the mid-teens. If physical predictors could be identified and incorporated into a model to predict the risk of developing schizophrenia prior to onset, doctors might be able to develop interventions to prevent schizophrenia.<br><br> Memory deficits have been associated with schizophrenia. The hippocampus is a medially located structure of the temporal lobe that regulates the formation and storage of memories. There were two objectives of this study: first, to identify whether or not there was a decreased hippocampal volume in schizophrenics compared to controls; secondly, to find the relationship between memory scores on the Woodcock-Johnson and hippocampal volume.<br><br> It is hypothesized that a reduced hippocampal volume may be a physical predictor of schizophrenia. The hippocampal volumes were measured in 13 schizophrenic and 13 control MRI brain scans. Each scan was loaded, one by one, into a program that recreated the image. Then the slices containing the hippocampus were identified, and the structure was manually segmented slice by slice.<br><br> A t-test showed no significant difference between the hippocampal volumes of the two groups in the left hemisphere. Although, there was no significant difference in the right hemisphere, the alpha level of 0.08 suggests that future research with a larger sample size may yield significant results. In addition, no significant correlation was found between hippocampal volume and memory scores. Future research may explore other hippocampal characteristics.<br><br>

BIO-POWER!!! CAN BIOLOGICAL NERVE ACTION POTENTIALS STIMULATE ARTIFICIAL MUSCLE, PLATINUM IPMCS?
Ethan Avram Kottke
Farmington High School, Farmington, New Mexico, USA

This investigation tested the optimal settings of an electrical signal to cause Platinum Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC - synthetic muscle) displacement, measured the action potential of a Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve, and tested the feasibility of using the action potential of a nerve to power Platinum IPMC displacement. The hypothesis was that once the optimal settings for Platinum IPMC displacement were found and the action potential was measured, the two signals would be similar and it would be possible for an action potential to power Platinum IPMC displacement.<br><br> To test the hypothesis, a piece of Platinum IPMC was placed in metal forceps and the amplitude, duration, and frequency were each isolated and varied until optimal displacement force was reached. A Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve was used to generate an action potential, which was measured. Next, the parameters to simulate the action potential were set on the signal generator and applied to the IPMC to determine the practicality of using a real nerve to power the synthetic muscle. A biological action potential was amplified and applied to the Platinum IPMC, causing displacement with a measurable force.<br><br> The results of this experiment showed the optimal settings for Platinum IPMC displacement and the electrical properties of a biological action potential. It also showed that it IS feasible to cause Platinum IPMC displacement when powered by a biological nerve action potential, supporting the hypothesis. The results were graphed and statistically analyzed using least squares regression, with a confidence level of 94 percent. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF COMMERCIAL AIRFLIGHT ON THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Tice Patrick Brown, Batesville Junior High
#2 School Road, Batesville, AR 72501, United States

Is the air in commercial aircraft low quality, causing a drop in blood-oxygen level and increase risks of upper respiratory infection?<br><br> It is hypothesized that, at the standard commercial air flight altitude of 32,000 feet, a combination of poor cabin air quality and the lower levels of oxygen at the higher altitudes will contribute to lower blood oxygen levels and higher rate of upper respiratory system infection in the following seven days.<br><br> Flights going to and from Memphis International Airport and to and from Denver International Airport were selected as the test flights. A total of thirty consenting test subjects were randomly selected for testing for the passengers on the flights. Age, sex, and smoking status were recorded for all individuals. These individuals were tested for blood oxygen level before and at maximum altitude of the flight. They were given self-addressed post cards to report upper respiratory infection (URI) status after seven days. Twenty responded, and approximate matches for age, sex, and smoker status were surveyed for URI status for the previous seven days in Batesville.<br><br> This study confirms the hypothesis that air quality inside the aircraft cabin compromises cabin air as noted by the drop in the blood oxygen levels in most subjects tested. This drop was more pronounced in older individuals, older smokers, and young children. There was no evidence that aircraft cabin air quality increased risks of URIs in passengers traveling in commercial aircraft.

COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF FLAVIVIRUS MATURATION: INHIBITING FURIN CLEAVAGE TO PRODUCE EFFECTIVE DENGUE TREATMENT AND VACCINE
Alexander Warren Hertel
West Lafayette High School, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA

The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, includes pathogenic viruses such as Dengue, Yellow Fever, Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus—all of which present a serious threat; Dengue alone accounts for more than 50 million infections per year, worldwide, with a fatality rate reaching 20%. There are no approved treatments or vaccines currently available. The objective of this research is to model the maturation process, in which infectivity occurs, thereby providing a basis for development of effective treatment and prophylaxis. Previous Cryo-Electron Microscopy of flaviviruses has yielded some structural information for the Dengue viron. During the maturation process, furin cleaves the pre-peptide protein, making the viron fusogenic and thus able to infect cells. However, the subsequent stage of dimerization is not well understood. In this research, structural data from Baker et al. was used to analyze the maturation and infection processes through computer simulation of the glycoprotein spikes using the Explorer software package. The data from these simulations are used to analyze Flavivirus maturation. The project then explores methods for inhibiting furin cleavage through simulation of protein behavior. It is concluded that deletion or replacement of the Arg codon on the prM particle will result in furin’s inability to recognize the pre-peptides, thereby preventing cleavage, maturation, and infectivity of the virus. This forms the foundation for development of an inactive antigen using the immature, mutant form of the virus that can be used to stimulate antibody production through a vaccine.

INTERACTION OF VIRUS CAPSID PROTEINS WITH DNASS-48MER
Mark Daniel Ladisch
West Lafayette High School, West Lafayette Indiana, USA

Immunoglobulin G was attached to a Biacore CM5 Sensor Chip for use as a receptor molecule. This biochip, approximately 1 cm.2, is a glass dielectric surface covered by a 50nm thick layer of gold. A biotinylated 48-mer of single stranded DNA was bound to the surface of a Biacore SA Sensor Chip containing streptavidin attached through amine coupling. Sindbis and Dengue virus capsid proteins (non-pathogenic alphavirus and flavivirus capsid proteins overexpressed by E. coli ) were injected into a Biacore 3000 using pH 6.0 NaPO4 buffer or a pH 7.4 KOAC buffer. The 48-mer binds tightly to 4 molecules of truncated Sindbus capsid per strand of DNA. Additional molecules bind less tightly. The 48-mer also binds tightly to at least 3 molecules of the full-length Dengue capsid. Competition experiments with 12-mer and 48-mer single stranded DNA show that binding does not occur if the capsid is pretreated with DNA. These experiments will be extended to single-stranded random oligomers of RNA. The ability of a single stranded DNA to bind capsid proteins provides an important model system for exploring an early step in virus particle assembly. If this process is well defined, it is possible to disrupt the assembly process and stop the virus from multiplying. The use of single stranded DNA to detect or separate a virus capsid from solution can save a large amount of time over identifying the existence of a virus through chromatography.

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, hypertension and heart disease. Currently, only limited number of patients receive islet transplants following the Edmonton Protocol by using a large amount of islet cells and different immunosuppressant agents. The serious limitation of this protocol is a shortage of donors to treat large number of patients. The INGAP peptide is a novel therapeutic agent for diabetes, since it normalizes glucose levels by inducing islet neogenesis and also enhances neurite outgrowth that is compromised in diabetic neuropathy. This experiment tested the effectiveness of the pentadecapeptide of INGAP on glucose levels of streptozotocin-induced mice in vivo and assessed the neurite outgrowth of explanted dorsal root ganglia. <br><br> C57/BL6 mice of one-month age were injected with INGAP peptide (25 mg/kg) or saline vehicle for 7 days. DRG explants were cultured in RPMI-1640 tissue culture media for 10 days and INGAP peptide (1000ng/mL) was added to the media every two days. With the in vivo administration of the INGAP peptide, there is a significant decrease in blood glucose levels of STZ-induced mice. The relative neurite outgrowth of STZ-induced mice DRG with INGAP treatment doubles in comparison to the non-treated diabetic DRG. <br><br> In order for the INGAP peptide to be delivered in humans, drug delivery systems, such as liposomes and vesicles could be suitable means to protect the peptide from degradation. It is conceivable that stealth liposomes will find an application in diabetes for delivery of peptides such as INGAP peptide.

THE ROLE OF IL-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA
Christopher Edward Lust
Century High School, Rochester, MN, USA

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a tumor of plasma cells. It has a benign state called MGUS and a SMM phase intermediate between MGUS and MM. Myeloma plasma cells produce Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) that stimulates Interleukin-6 (IL-6) to be produced by nearby bone marrow stromal cells. IL-6 is the major growth factor for myeloma cells. Plasma cells from SMM and approximately 25% MGUS patients also produce IL-1beta. However, the majority of these cells stimulate low levels of IL-6 production by stromal cells and these patients progress slowly to myeloma. A minority of SMM patients have plasma cells that induce high levels of IL-6 with rapid disease progression. This project investigates whether variations in levels of an IL-1beta inhibitor (IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra) could explain the differences in these progression rates. We hypothesized that patients with myeloma would have lower IL-1Ra levels when compared with MGUS or SMM patients that have not progressed. IL-1Ra levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that patients with active myeloma had a low relative IL-1Ra, whereas, patients with the benign MGUS state had a high level. Patients with SMM had a wide range of relative IL-1Ra values. The SMM patients fell into two groups, those with relative IL-1Ra values greater than 1 or less than 1. These two groups were also found to be statistically different at the 0.05 level. These studies suggest that variations in IL-1Ra levels may be an important difference in disease progression and that IL-1Ra may be a useful therapy for this disease.

THE CORRELATIOON BETWEEN FINGER LENGTH AND TESTOSTERONE
Tammy S. Shirley
Francis Howell North, Saint Charles, Missouri 

This project was completed in order to determine the correlation between the difference in and/or ratio of the length of the second and fourth fingers of males ages fourteen to eighteen and their corresponding testosterone levels. Because drawing blood to determine the exact amount of testosterone in each subject's system was not an option, testosterone levels were indirectly measured by using a spatial relations exam, comparing 3.1 mile running times, and examining subjects' success in wrestling. Subjects were broken into three groups: the control, test group one (cross country runners), and test group two (wrestlers). Each subject was tested individually, and the data was analyzed using a t-test and the Pearson product moment correlation coefficents. The only data that proved to have a signigicant linear correlation with 95% confidence was the average (between the left and right hands of subjects) ratio, average difference, and the largest difference of the two hands as compared to test group one's spatial judgement scores. It was concluded that, although some data did prove significant, there is no strong correlation between the length of the second and fourth fingers of males and the amount of testosterone in their system.

A POSSIBLE BREAST CANCER TREATMENT: INTERFERON ALPHA COMBINED WITH INDOLE-3-CARBINOL
Diane Laura Gumina
Merino High School Merino, Colorado 80741 USA

Recently, there has been concern about the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the metastatic rates of breast cancer. There have been few large-scale research studies that focus primarily on the effects of HRT on metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if the HRT drug, Prempro, increases the metastasis rates in human breast cancer. Interferon Alpha is the only cancer treatment drug on the market that stops angiogenesis, the creation of blood vessels by the tumor; an important aspect contributing to metastasis. The compound sulforaphane is found in the Brassica family of vegetables. The production of phase 2 enzymes, that sulforaphane induces, increases regeneration and lowers free radicals. This research will include the uses of Interferon Alpha and sulforaphane, in the drug form of Indole-3-Carbinol. To test the metastasis in vitro, the Western Blot Analysis will be used to confirm the expression of MMP's (Matrix Metalloproteinases) and the inhibitor TIMP's (Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases). When metastasis is going to occur, the correlation between MMP's and TIMP's is inversely proportional; the increase in the MMP's indicates metastasis. To test for MMP's, a Western Blot Analysis and Gelatin Zymography Assay were used. The tests did show an increase in the expression of the MMP's. In the Zymography test, bands showing the expression of MMP's were present with the addition of Prempro. In the future more studies need to be done that focus on the effects of hormone replacement therapy on metastasis in breast and other cancers.<br><br>

NATIVE AMERICAN HERBS AS ANTIBIOTICS
Hannah Euphrates Woriax
Purnell Swett High School

By definition, an antibiotic is one of any number of toxic compounds naturally produced by microorganisms (molds, bacteria, and actinomycetes) to target and destroy competing microorganisms. Today, the term antibiotic is more commonly used to refer to synthetic or partly synthetic compounds used medically against bacteria that cause illness in humans, animals, and plants. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to examine the effectiveness of six (6) herbal remedies using the Kirby-Bauer test. In this report, extracts from plants commonly used by Native American cultures to either flavor foods or as herbal medicines were prepared and tested to determine the antibiotic effects of the herbs on Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698), a gram positive bacteria, and Escherichia coli (Strain K12, ATCC 14948), a gram negative bacteria. The effectiveness of the herbal extracts was compared with three commercial antibiotic preparations. Results indicate that extracts from dried, crushed Golden seal, Ginger, Cloves of Garlic, and Sage were effective in inhibition of E. coli while Golden seal, Cloves of Garlic, Sage, and Cayenne Pepper inhibited the growth of M. luteus under the conditions of this experiment. Hence, as tested, only Golden seal, Cloves of Garlic, and Sage inhibited growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains. Interestingly, unlike fresh cloves, neither garlic oil nor garlic powder inhibited either bacteria.

SIMVASTATIN ACTIVATION OF RYANODINE RECEPTOR MEDIATED CALCIUM CHANNELS MAY PROMOTE MYOLYSIS
Daniel Jacob Sachs
John Jay High School, Cross River, NY, USA

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, widely prescribed for lowering cholesterol, are known to cause muscle breakdown in a small but significant percentage (about 1-7%) of patients. Some lipophilic drugs, such as the anesthetic halothane, are known to cause muscle breakdown in patients with disorders of the ryanodine receptor (RYR), a protein which controls regulation of intracellular calcium. The purpose of this study was to determine whether simvastatin, a highly lipophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, activates RYR mediated calcium channels in cells. I also sought to determine whether increasing the expression of RYR proteins with immune factors would lower the threshold concentration of simvastatin necessary to induce a significant calcium release. RYR-mediated calcium channels in SKW 6.4™ B-lymphocyte cells were isolated, and cytosolic calcium concentrations were monitored based on a flow cytometric procedure to measure fluorescence intensity of fluo-3, a calcium-sensitive dye. Simvastatin induced the release of calcium through RYR mediated channels at 50µM and 100µM concentrations, and at 10µM after cells were treated with immune factors. The action of simvastatin on RYR mediated channels may be the mechanism of muscle breakdown, and the inflammatory response may increase patient risk of such side effects.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS AND THE HUMAN IMMUNO-DEFICIENCY VIRUS
Ilene Claire Albala
John Jay High School, Cross River NY, USA

Aim: To investigate the relationship between HIV and MDR-TB. <br><br>Methods: Data on TB cases in NYC between 1991-2001 including gender, age, race/ethnicity, nativity, homelessness, Medicaid, drug use, respiratory smear, HIV status, and death was obtained. Statistics included univariate and multivariate analyses and stratification by time.<br><br>Results: Among the 19,108 cases of TB, 9% (1,685) had MDR-TB. HIV status was reported on 15,144 people; 15% were confirmed HIV positive (HIV+). In univariate models, age (p=0.001), gender (p<0.004), homelessness (p<0.009), U.S. nativity (p<0.0001), and Medicaid (p<0.0001) were associated with MDR-TB. HIV+ (OR 1, p<0.05) was not linked. In multivariate models, Medicaid (OR 1.3, p<0.0001) and nativity (OR 2.9, p<0.0001) predicted MDR-TB. A significant relationship between MDR-TB and HIV was seen in 1991-1992, which attenuated from 1993 onwards. <br><br>Conclusions: This data suggests that a biological relationship between HIV and MDR-TB may be spurious. However, HIV and MDR-TB share common risk factors. This study has important bioethical implications.

DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF BIOACTIVE CINNAMON COMPONENTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN MUS MUSCULUS
Heather Nicole Wood
Brookside High School, Sheffield, Ohio, USA

A recent newspaper article stated that diabetics should contact their physicians before including cinnamon in their diet. The researcher was curious to know to what extent cinnamon affects blood glucose levels in living organisms. Mice, 90% similar to humans in their genetic make up, were chosen as test subjects.<br><br> Twenty female, albino mice were quarantined for 25 days and were examined for any signs of disease or pregnancy. No pregnant mice were used in this project to avoid variations in hormone levels associated with pregnancy. Tattooing on the tail was chosen as a way to permanently identify each mouse. On five alternating days in a ten day period each mouse's blood glucose level was measured by random plasma glucose testing with a One Touch Ultra glucose meter, to establish baseline blood glucose levels. In the following test sessions, blood glucose levels were recorded in both the control and the test groups on five alternate days in an additional ten day period. Each mouse in the test group was given 40 mg/kg of cinnamon orally in .04 ml of water. Forty-five minutes after administering the cinnamon solution, both the tests and the control group's blood glucose levels were measured again.<br><br> In 60% of the test mice blood glucose levels decreased while in 34% the glucose levels increased and 6% stayed the same. In the control group the glucose levels decreased in 38%, increased in 54%, and 4% stayed the same.<br><br> At the end of the testing the hypothesis that cinnamon would decrease the glucose levels in the mice was proven correct. This information can be applied to the daily life of a diabetic monitoring their glucose levels. Cinnamon when used alone to enhance the flavor of foods could affect a diabetic's insulin requirements.<br><br>

A ROLE FOR GREEN TEA POLYPHENOLS IN THE INHIBITION OF HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR MEDIATED PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION
Christopher Ku Yu
Caddo Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA United States

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men. The risk of developing prostate cancer is higher in the United States and Europe, where the lifetime chance of being diagnosed is 1 in 6. Prostate cancer is a slow growing form of cancer, but if prostate cancer invades tissues and metastasizes, or spreads throughout the body, it can become extremely deadly.<br><br> The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/scatter factor) is manufactured in the human body, and is believed to play a key role in the development and progression of most cancers, including prostate cancer. It has been found that HGF is able to induce dramatic changes to prostate cancer cells in vitro in a time and dose dependent manner. HGF-induced changes are dependent upon the activation of the PI 3-Kinase and MAP-Kinase signaling pathways. These two pathways have been demonstrated to play a role in tumor invasion.<br><br> Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol component of green tea, has been found to be a natural chemopreventative agent for many types of human cancers. Studies have demonstrated that EGCG blocks HGF-induced cell scattering and activation of the PI 3-Kinase and MAP-Kinase signaling pathways. Current studies on the mechanisms involved in HGF-mediated changes that lead to invasion and metastasis, as well as the role of EGCG as a chemopreventative agent, may lead to the development of better clinical treatments, one possibly being as simple as the consumption of tea. <br><br>

DISEASE PROPAGATION THROUGH CONNECTIVE PATHS: APPLICATION OF THE SMALL WORLD THEORY TO EPIDEMIC MODELLING
Anna-Katrina Shedletsky
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY USA

The researcher developed an original methodology designed to provide a deeper insight into the spread of disease. Initially inspired by Milgram's Small World Theory, the research combined his idea of population connectivity with computer simulation-based epidemiology, two previously unrelated fields of study. Two programs were written in Visual C++: one to create 300 sample populations with different connectivity metrics, and another to run 7,500 simulated propagation trials. The average number of individuals removed by the epidemic was found to be an exponential function of the connections per capita in the given population. The average time for the epidemic to burn out was shown to rise and then fall, as the number of connections per capita increased.<br><br>Analytically determining the epidemic behavior in a large connected population is virtually impossible. The computer simulations enable the investigation of the variability of the epidemic outcome, as well as its average behavior. Epidemic distributions were discovered which describe this variability and reveal how it changes as the connectivity of the population changes. The results exhibited three distinct regions of epidemic behavior as the connectivity of the population increased. <br><br>The epidemic distribution predicts how far and how fast a disease will spread in a population, and how those results are likely to vary. Studies indicated that the presence of even one highly connected individual ("Typhoid Mary") can dramatically alter the spread of disease. Discovering this epidemic behavior is a very significant result, and provides the researcher with simple, but intriguing new strategies to combat epidemics.

ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE OR IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME?
Joni Dawn Ross
Alva High School, Alva, OK, USA

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are becoming more prevalent in society today. Symptoms of these painful disorders can range anywhere from abdominal pain to heavy bleeding and abnormal bowel movements. The purpose of this research project was to determine if a correlation exists between the number of times individuals eat fast food per week to whether or not they possess Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS); the amount of regular exposure individuals experience, as a child, to second hand smoke to whether or not the individual possesses CD, UC, or IBS; and the individual's family history of CD, UC, or IBS to whether or not the individuals possesses CD, UC, or IBS. In addition, this project was designed to determine if a statistical difference exists between the stress levels of individuals who possess CD, UC, or IBS compared to the stress levels of individuals who do not possess an IBD or IBS. Questionnaires were distributed to people across the globe between the ages of 13 and 65. Correlation coefficient values determined that a positive relationship exists between the individuals' family history of IBD or IBS to whether or not individuals possess an IBD or IBS. In addition, a t-test showed that stress levels of individuals with an IBD or IBS were significantly higher than stress levels of individuals without an IBD or IBS.

THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES ON THE PACEMAKER
Adriana Candelario
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo Puerto Rico, United States

This investigation was done with the purpose of finding if the electromagnetic waves that the cellular phone emits affect the functioning of the pacemaker and to determine up to what point the pacemaker can be influenced by these waves. At the same time, the main interest was to investigate if these waves can present a potential risk on the people that use pacemakers. It was hypothesized that if the electromagnetic waves of the cellular phone cause interference to the pacemaker, then it would not have an effective functioning. To determine whether the hypothesis was correct, a series of steps were followed. The first step was to place the pacemaker programmer to five volts, situating the electrode of the pacemaker programmer on the cover. After this, the cellular phone was put into use by making and receiving calls. Then, the cellular phone was located at different distances from the pacemaker to determine its effect on the pacemaker. Finally, tables and graphs were made of the data collected. It can be concluded that a cellular phone, when placed at a distance of fifteen centimeters or more from the pacemaker, it only detects the electromagnetic waves the cellular phone emits but is not affected by them. Nevertheless at a distance of eight centimeters or less the pacemaker is affected by the waves causing a potential risk on the people that use pacemakers and do not take the necessary precautions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND HEART DEFECTS IN CHILDREN
Maria Isabel Guzman
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this epidemiological study is to establish an association between periodontal disease during pregnancy and the risk of bearing a child with heart defects. The proposed study is a pair- matched case-control study. There are no studies reporting the association of periodontal disease and congenital heart defects in the children. It was hypothesized that the presence of periodontal disease during pregnancy has no significant association with the development of congenital heart defects in children. A questionnaire designed by the Qualified Scientist was adapted to this study and administered to 40 volunteers to determine its reliability and validity. The variables were analyzed using Chi-Square Analysis in the Epi-Info 6 program to determine an association. Based on the tendency of association found, this investigation will proceed to evaluate the bacterial flora of the mother and the bacteria's sensitivity to antibiotics to identify the periodontal pathogens in the gums. Regarding this part of the investigation, it was hypothesized that the bacterial flora cavities of the periodontal pathogens do not differ at the several intensities of periodontal disease and that the bacteria present in periodontal disease in the mothers and heart defects in the child is relevant for the prevention and control of congenital malformation. These preliminary results established a tendency that should create awareness that prenatal care should include a dental evaluation to reduce the exposure to bacteriological profiles.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT COLOR DEFICIENCY THROUGH THE CONSENSUAL PUPILLARY RESPONSE?
Andrew Allen Lenoir, Gulliver Preparatory School
6575 Kendall Drive Miami, FL 33156

The purpose of this research is to test for anomalous trichromasy by observing the consensual pupillary response. It was hypothesized that through observing the consensual pupillary response to different wavelengths of light with equal spectral irradiance it is possible to detect color deficiency. An "Eyelight (V .6)" was developed by the investigator in order for this to be accomplished. Subjects placed the "Eyelight" over the dominant (and non-dominant) eye in a darkened room. The control group consisted of blue-eyed subjects with normal vision, while the experimental group consisted of blue-eyed subjects with anomalous trichromasy. Results were recorded on a digital recorder attached to a Generation II night amplification scope fitted with a zoom lens. The results show a significant difference between subjects that had red-green color deficiency and subjects with normal vision. Normal subjects had more of a variety of difference between color responses compared to white, color deficient subjects had much more of a similar response to color as compared to their response to white. The finding of this study could benefit pharmacology by aiding the treatment of A.I.D.S. and tuberculosis with a pronounced contribution in the field of pediatrics.

DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH CURCUMIN INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELL LINE: THE CURCUMIN CONNECTION
Reshma Ramachandran
Coral Reef Senior High School, Miami, FL, USA

Curcumin, the active principle in the tropical spice called turmeric, is believed to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the differential curcumin cytotoxicity of human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. Studies were conducted to analyze the curcumin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells and the underlying mechanisms associated with the process.<br><br>The immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were used for the investigation. Cell proliferation assay was performed to estimate the percentage of surviving cells in each dose. The amount of curcumin in the medium was estimated spectrophotometrically to find out the degradation if any, of these agents at the end of the treatment period. To analyze the mechanism of cell death, the percantage of apoptotic cells (annexin V-EGFP positive cells) were determined in each dose flow cytometrically. Microarray hybroidization of apoptotic arrays was done to see gene expression changes wihtin breast cancer cells during apoptosis. <br><br>Both, the whole turmeric powder and its constituent, curcumin, were cytotoxic to breast cancer cells, the latter being more effective than the turmeric powder. Curcumin induces high percentage of apoptosis in MCF-7 than in MCF-10A cells, which correlated with higher levels of detoxification in MCF-10A cells than in MCF-7. Microarray hybridization showed that curcumin upregulates several pro-apoptotic genes and downregulates several anti-apoptotic genes in breast cancer cells during the process of programmed cell death. The results indicate the potential usefulness of curcumin as a chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agent against human breast cancer.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF BODY HABITUS ON RELIABILITY OF CARDIAC NUCLEAR IMAGING AT TWO INSTITUTIONS IN VIVO AND IN VITRO--YEAR 2
Winston H. Messer, Presbyterian Christian High School
Hattiesburg, MS, United States

This study sought to link body habitus and photon counts with scan reliability. Phase IV established linearity for counts and acquisition time for a given density (p<.001), and offered promise if accuracy were shown to be related to counts.<br><br> Phase V analyzed 551 patients’ scans at two institutions comparing accuracy with three determinants of body habitus and photon counts. All three determinants—Weight (220 pounds), BMI (35), and %Body Fat (40%)--predicted diminished accuracy. Heavier patients were more affected at FGH (p=.04549) than HC. The accuracy difference at FGH (7.1%) for heavier patients was statistically significant (p=.0011), but not at HC.<br><br> Counts were greater (21.0%) for lighter patients at both institutions, and HC counts were greater than FGH (p=.001). However, analyzing FGH scans using a higher count goal did not increase accuracy (88.9% vs. 90.1%), suggesting that counts may be a marker of a bad scan rather than the cause.<br><br> Artifact diminished reliability at FGH (14.1%, p=.00002), but not HC. Accuracy problems demonstrated for body habitus and artifact were exclusively FGH’s. Phase VI ruled out significant differences in the cameras’ ability to record photon counts at the two institutions, and a 5 point interpretation score was developed that could predict scan reliability at FGH.<br><br> Four final project recommendations were presented to and accepted by the FGH Quality Management Committee—implementing the 5 point interpretation score, notification of FGH medical staff of accuracy problems related to body habitus and artifact, reviewing scan technique differences, and replacing the current FGH camera software.

POST ICD IMPLANT CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA STUDY: WHICH ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUG IS MOST POTENT IN SUPPRESSION OF POST ICD IMPLANT ARRHYTHMIAS?
Siddhi Narendra Upadhyaya
Stranahan High School, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA

Cardiac arrhythmias cost millions of dollars and multiple lives. The traditional drug therapy for serious ventricular arrhythmias was unpredictable and associated with serious side effects and drug interactions. Comparison of ICD (Implanatable Cardioverter Defibrillator) device and antiarrhythmic drugs clearly proved superiority of ICD, yet ICD failed to suppress all serious ventricular arrhythmias. Around the world, physicians use multiple antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress post ICD implant arrhythmias. Choice of drug depends primarily upon physician preference with consideration of associated medical conditions. There is no scientific data to help select the correct, most efficient, and safest drug. This study uses commonly used drugs but experiments with and answers the question: which single agent is superior and should be the first choice? A total of 150 patients with baseline arrhythmias (1 week post ICD implant) were enrolled in this study. The physician assigned each patient to a primary drug: Amiodarone, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers-the most commonly used drugs. Patients were followed at 3, 6, 9, and 10 month intervals. During every visit, patient interview and ICD interrogation were performed. At the 3 month interval, if patents had persistent arrhythmias, Amiodarone or beta blocker was given as a secondary agent by the physician. Amiodarone was clearly the most powerful drug in suppressing post ICD arrhythmias as a primary and secondary drug. Unless there is a specific contraindication or concern about side effects and/or drug interaction, Amiodarone should be used as the first line of treatment in patients with post ICD implant arrhythmias.

SUB-LETHAL EXPOSURE OF GERMAN COCKROACHES TO PESTICIDES CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASED EXPRESSION OF BLA G 2, AN ALLERGEN ASSOCIATED WITH INNER CITY ASTHMA
Yi-Chen Zhang
Bronx H.S. of Science, Bronx NY, USA

German cockroaches produce various potent allergens designated Bla g 1, Bla g 2, and Bla g 5 that have shown binding to human IgE antibodies. Exposure to these allergens can cause the onset or the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses and allergic reactions, particularly among inner city children. Attempts to control cockroach infestation include the application of pesticides such as hydramethylnon gel and boric acid that kill some cockroaches directly, and serve as an indirect food source for others that feed off the dead carcasses. Because the allergens are highly associated with the cockroach digestive system, one may speculate that cockroach ingestion of sub-lethal doses of pesticides may change the levels of allergen production. ELISA procedures yielded no significant difference in Bla g 1 and Bla g 5 levels between the pesticide colonies and the control colonies that were fed Rodent Diet 5001. However, there was a strong association between the ingestion of boric acid and an increase in Bla g 2 levels. Western blot analysis of crude cockroach fecal material extract indicated that many cockroach antigens were present, some of which may be allergenic. This implies that the application of boric acid may paradoxically increases the risk for cockroach allergen exposure.

The development of Osteoarthritis, the most common of all joint disorders, has long been attributed to mechanical loading, or physical stress. However, this view has led to little success in providing treatment and prevention for this disorder. This study provides a novel approach to Osteoarthritis by viewing it as a systemic disorder that results from the elevation in the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) caused by disruptions in certain metabolic mechanisms, including the leptin pathway and its interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In this study the effects of ACTH on the proliferation and differentiation of rat rib growth plate chondrocytes under different culture conditions are examined. [3H]Thymidine incorporation and cell protein content were used to determine the levels of proliferation while differentiation was delineated through measuring Alkaline Phosphatase enzyme activity, Collagen Type II and Osteopontin expressions by Northern Blot, and Collagen Type X through RT-PCR. Results indicate that under defined medium, chondrocytes exposed to ACTH exhibit decreased proliferation and augmented differentiation, strongly supporting the hypothesis that ACTH is directly involved in the development of Osteoarthritis.

Bitter gourd and turmeric have antioxidants that may kill cancer cells by targeting free-radicals. It was hypothesized that as the different concentrations of bitter gourd and turmeric extracts added to cell cultures of mouse mammary tumor cells (in vitro) are increased, the number of viable cancer cells would be reduced significantly. It was further hypothesized that extracts added to cell cultures of normal mammary cells (in vitro) would not significantly reduce the number of viable mammary cells at any concentration. <br><br> Three control flasks received 2 ml of 0.9% saline. Equal numbers of flasks (3) received either 2 ml of the 100% bitter gourd extract, 2 ml of the 50% extract, or 2 ml of the 25% bitter gourd extract. The same number of flasks received the same concentrations of the turmeric extracts. The extracts were applied to both types of cells and incubated for 6 days. Results showed that the 100%, 50%, and 25% bitter gourd concentrations reduced the number of viable cancer cells by 99.73%, 93%, and 89%, respectively. The 100%, 50%, and 25% turmeric concentrations reduced the number of cancer cells by 87%, 75%, 62%, respectively. The number of control cancer cells increased by 5.10%. The 100%, 50%, and 25% bitter gourd concentrations reduced the number of normal cells by 10.6%, 4.4%, and 2.3%, respectively. The 100%, 50%, and 25% turmeric concentrations reduced the number of normal cells by 8.9%, 3.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. The number of control normal cells increased by 4.95%. The extracts were very effective!<br><br>

RESTRAINING RESTENOSIS: COMBATING VASCULAR DISEASE- YEAR 3
Julian C Hong
Ronald Reagan High School, San Antonio, TX, United States

Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are critical to arterial restenosis that follows procedures that reopen blocked arteries. Endothelial cells (EC), which form the artery lining, decrease SMC proliferation and migration.<br><br> The objective was to determine how shear stress, frictional force exerted by the flow of fluid, influences EC effects on SMC. It was hypothesized that high shear (HS,16 dyn/cm2), similar to that in healthy arteries, would stimulate EC to reduce SMC migration while low shear (LS, 2 dyn/cm2) would follow on a lesser level. An arterial wall model was used where EC, on a porous mesh, shared culture media with SMC suspended in collagen underneath. The EC layer was subjected to two levels of flow-associated shear and SMC migration, proliferation and expression of migration-related integrins were measured. SMC morphology within collagen was investigated.<br><br> Results indicated HS EC significantly decreased SMC migration compared to control areas without EC (p<0.05). EC under LS, similar to shear in areas prone to disease, did not inhibit SMC. HS EC increased SMC organization and changed morphology, producing elongated cells, resembling those in vivo. However, SMC under EC exposed to LS were randomly oriented wider cells. A higher percentage of migrated SMC in EC areas under HS exhibited avB3 integrin but significantly lower percentage expressed PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) indicating lower cell replication.<br><br> These findings support the importance of considering flow conditions when encouraging EC to recover arterial areas injured during procedures to open blocked arteries such as angioplasty and especially stenting.

DETECTION OF SURFACE ANTIGEN MUTANTS IN THE A DETERMINANT REGION OF CHILDREN THAT FAILED NEONATAL HEPATITIS B PROPHYLAXIS
Jennifer Shui-Ming Ling, John L. Miller Great Neck North High School
Great Neck NY, USA

In the United States, an estimated 20,000 infants are born to Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive women each year. These infants are given neonatal Hepatitis B prophylaxis: a regimen that consists of Hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIG) given within 24 hours of birth and a series of three Hepatitis B vaccines given at birth, one month and six months respectively. When administered appropriately, this prophylaxis is approximately 95% effective in protecting the infant from perinatal HBV transmission. In Phase 1 of this research that was conducted last year, it was shown that infants who were given neonatal Hepatitis B prophylaxis have a higher clearance rate than the infants without prophylaxis in the first ten years of life (p<0.009). Phase 2 which was conducted this year examines whether mutations in the HBV surface gene are an important cause of neonatal HBV prophylaxis failure. This phase is a new molecular biologic analysis of the Hepatitis B virus that was performed on archived clinical specimens. The surface gene of eighteen HBV virus infected children who have failed prophylaxis was studied in order to determine if a mutation impacted the success of the neonatal Hepatitis B prophylaxis. The a determinant region of the surface gene (amino acids 110-116) was amplified and mapped out in order to detect any sequence mutations. Results showed two of the eighteen patients to have mutations in the a determinant region. Therefore it was not shown that mutations in the a determinant region were less susceptible to neutralization by current HBIG preparations and currently recommended anti-HBV vaccines. It is a hope of future research to find an explanation for the initial Hepatitis B prophylaxis failure.

A SURVEY OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT DRUGS FOR FANCONI ANEMIA
Jenna B. Edginton
West Linn High School, West Linn, Oregon

Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by birth defects, increased incidence of malignancy and progressive bone marrow failure. Since bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is therapeutic, therefore FA is a candidate disease for hematopoietice gene therapy, which can be best tested in an animal model. Previously, our lab generated a Fanconi Anemia group A knock-out mouse since it is the most common defect in FA, representing approximately 65% of all patients. Prior results from this lab showed that the selection of wild-type bone marrow (BM) was enhanced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of Mitomycin C. In order to search for a better drug and one that has been used in FA patients, Noll et.al. used Cyclophosphamide (CPA) as the selective agent which produced a significant selection of the donor cells even with a very low dose. Since the FA patients are sensitive to cross-linkers, a study of other drugs (Ara-C, Busulfan and Doxorubicin) already being used in BMT would potentially enhance the gene therapy options in FA patients. A cohort of non preconditioned FANCA-/- mice were transplanted with 1X10^6 unfractionated wild-type BMCs. No donor cells were detected in the peripheral blood after transplantation alone. But a single i.p. injection of either of the above mentioned drugs showed the donor cells in the peripheral blood of FANCA-/- mice which has been stable for 4 months now. Secondary recipients are being generated and will be followed for the presence of the donor allele. Details of these results will be discussed.

INHIBITION OF CISPLATIN-INDUCED APOPTOSIS BY AKT2: IMPLICATION OF AKT2 IN CHEMORESISTANCE
Gene Everett Sussman
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, New York, USA

As our population ages the incidence of cancer continues to rise. Ovarian Cancer has a death rate of 14,000 cases annually with 24,000 new cases each year. Cisplatin, a widely used and effective form of therapy against ovarian and other forms of cancer, works for about 6 months to year of usage. Unfortunately after this time, a resistance often develops to this drug with the molecular mechanism of this resistance largely unknown. I believe that AKT2, a kinase that is frequently overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers and that helps the cancer cell respond to stress, may be one of the major components of this cellular resistance.<br><br> Cisplatin causes apoptosis, or cell death, by activation of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway and induction of Bid cleavage and Bax conformation; but decreased apoptosis and increased cellular proliferation occurs when activated AKT2 is added to cisplatin sensitive ovarian cancer cells. The expression of active AKT2 made sensitive A2780S cells resistant to cisplatin by inhibition of cisplatin directed phosphorylation of ASK1 at Ser-83. This down-regulated JNK and p38 activation which inhibited Bid cleavage and reduced Bax conformational change. This proved the importance of AKT2 to cellular cisplatin resistance. This study also demonstrated that P13-Kinase inhibitor (LY294002) and dominant negative AKT2 sensitized A2780S cells to cisplatin programmed cell death. All this data indicates that AKT2 inhibits cisplatin-induced activation of JNK/p38, Bid cleavage and Bax conformation, and thus plays an important role in chemoresistance. Therefore, AKT2 should increase the long term efficacy of cisplatin in combating ovarian cancer. I look forward to the day human trials can begin with a safe agent that can target AKT2 in ovarian cancer cells and lead to an increase in disease free and long term survival in women.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF A TEST COMPOUND ON RAT BRAIN TUBULIN POLYMERIZATION
Mark David Cross
South River High School, Edgewater MD, USA

The use of drugs that disrupt the conversion of the cellular protein tubulin into microtubules is recognized as an important chemotherapeutic approach. Many anticancer medications reduce tumor growth by blocking microtubule formation. The purpose of this study was to observe how different drugs could modulate the ability of tubulin to form microtubules in cells. In order to prevent polymerization of tubulin into microtubules, one must find a drug that can either "freeze" the cell at metaphase, or bind to tubulin to prevent the construction of protofilaments. To test this, tubulin was extracted from rat brain cells and frozen down. This freezing process depolymerized the tubulin into stable ALPHA/BETA-tubulin dimers. The tubulin was then resuspended in a solution containing GTP (to facilitate the binding of the dimers) and heated to 37°C. This caused the ALPHA/BETA-tubulin dimers to bind with the GTP, causing the GTP bound to the BETA-tubulin to hydrolyze to GDP. When the sample was incubated to 37°C, the ALPHA/BETA-tubulin dimers coupled together to form protofilaments, which then polymerized to form microtubules. This process was measured by the use of a spectrophotometer to monitor the absorbance of the solution containing the tubulin and microtubules. The absorbance reading increased as more polymerization occurred and more microtubules were formed in the solution. A sample of tubulin was then spiked with tubulin molecules that had been tagged with a fluorescent molecule called rhodamine; polymerization of this sample incorporated the rhodamine fluorescence into the microtubules so that the polymers formed could be observed under the microscope.

BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS OF BREAST CANCER ASSOCIATED MISSENSE MUTATIONS IN THE CARBOXYL-TERMINAL DOMAINS OF BRCA-1.
Meaghan Alexandra Figge
Albany Academy for Girls, Albany, New York, United States

New strategies are needed to identify women at high risk for breast cancer. Inherited mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA-1, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, but the biologic significance of a given missense mutation is difficult to predict. The carboxyl-terminal region of BRCA-1 encodes two functionally important domains (BRCT domains)that are conserved in mammalian species (human, dog, rat, mouse). It was hypothesized that missense mutations in the BRCT domains from high risk patients would perturb: (1) evolutionarily conserved primary structure, (2) secondary structure, (3) conserved physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, electrostatic charge).<br><br> A computerized bioinformatic analysis of 75 known BRCT missense mutations from high-risk women was conducted. Secondary structure was predicted with the program PROF and validated against the known X-ray crystal structure of the BRCT domains. An algorithm was developed to classify the evolutionarily conserved physicochemical properties at each amino acid position and to assess the effects of the mutations. The missense mutations disproportionately affected the highly conserved primary structure (Z=3.19, p=0.001). There was no significant effect on predicted secondary structure. Conserved amino acids with strongly hydrophobic or charged side chains were disproportionately affected by the mutations (Z=2.81, p=0.0025).<br><br> Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions may stabilize protein structures that are critical for BRCA-1 tumor suppressor function. Missense mutations affecting highly conserved amino acids with strongly hydrophobic or charged side chains may play a role in breast cancer formation. My algorithm may help identify biologically significant BRCA-1 missense mutations that play a role in breast cancer formation. This algorithm could assist in genetic counseling and facilitate earlier diagnosis of breast cancer. <br><br>

AMALGAM FILLING MAY BE TOXIC TO DAPHNIA AND MAY BE KILLING YOU!
Anna Maria Hall
Lew Wallace High School, Gary, Indiana, USA

Amalgam fillings in your mouth may be toxic to Daphnia. There is evidence that amalgam fillings causes heart problems, kidney problems, neurological disorders, and birth defects. In this study Daphnia was used to indirectly model the effects of growth and development of cells in humans for the effects of leaching mercury from amalgam fillings. Solutions of 100 mL of distilled water and 1 to 6 amalgam filling equivalents in 500ml bottles were made. I shook the bottles for 5 days to simulate chewing and grinding of teeth in an effort to cause the mercury to leach out of the Amalgam. I introduced Daphnia to each environment with 1 drop of food and recorded the population change and the respiration rate. I added one drop of food on the first day and observed their habits to determine if the substances that leached out of the amalgam filling would have an effect on the respiration rate or population size according to the Amalgam amount of exposure to the specimen. Daphnia are sensitive organism used to test for toxins in water. The population respiration rate increased in the variables and not in the control showing that something in the environment stressed the Daphnia. All populations with Amalgam decreased more that 50 % except in the contol, which increased, by more than 50%. The elements in the environment lowered the survival rate and increased the respiration rate of Daphnia. In conclusion, mercury in Amalgam could also have an effect on humans as well.

TOOTH DECAY CAUSED BY CITRIC ACID
Cassandra J. Spaulding
Roy High School Roy, UT USA

This project determined the rate of tooth enamel erosion caused by exposure to citric acid. Many acids can attack tooth enamel including phosphoric acid, which is found in soft drinks. The experiments of this project were used to measure the effect of exposing tooth enamel to citric acid.<br><br> Healthy teeth were exposed to a defined level of citric acid. This level was the average level of citric acid in oranges as listed in a U.S. Department of Agriculture document. Teeth were submerged in the acidic water without agitation during the time of exposure. A separate set of teeth was submerged in distilled water during this same time period. These were used as controls.<br><br> Each tooth was removed once a day during the time erosion was actively occurring. After removal the tooth was rinsed with water and brushed with toothpaste. It was then rinsed and dried. The tooth’s width was then measured with a micrometer. Great care was taken in order to assure that the measurements took place at the same location on the tooth each day.<br><br> The results were surprising. Within six days all of the enamel had been eroded. Using the rate of decay it was determined that there did exist the potential of complete erosion of the enamel. It could occur during the average lifetime of a human being if that person drinks several glasses of orange juice a day. This awareness leads to preventive measures that counteract the damage caused by citric acid found in any drink. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF BENZYLQUINONE, A CYTOCHROME C INHIBITOR, ON GIARDIA
Priscilla Yvette Mendoza
Americas High School, El Paso, TX, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if 25 µm, 50 µm, and 100 µm Benzylquinone, a Cytochrome C Inhibitor, had any effect on the intestinal parasite, Giardia. Giardia cells were harvested, and a scraping technique was used to loosen the Giardia cells from the flask. A 1:100 dilution was made. The cells were counted to determine the number of cells to be treated with Benzylquinone. Using a pipette, 1.35 µl, 2.7 µl, and 5.4 µl of Benzylquinone were added to each test tube. PBS and the Giardia cells were also added to each test tube. Control #1 and Control #2 were prepared. All test tubes were incubated at 37 ° C for one hour. Diamond’s media (TYDK) and 40 µl PIP were added to each test tube. All test tubes were incubated again at 37° C overnight. The test tubes were placed in ice, and the cells were counted. <br><br> From the results of this experiment, it can be concluded that treating Giardia cells with increasing concentrations of Benzylquinone reduced the number of live Giardia cells. The treatment utilizing 100 µm of Benzylquinone resulted in a reduction rate of 70%. Giardia cells do not contain mitochondria; however, Benzylquinone, a Cytochrome C Inhibitor found in mitochondria, appeared to be very effective at killing Giardia cells. <br><br>

LEUKEMIC CELLS INDUCED BY ANTI-CANCER DRUG RETINOIC ACID: A MICROARRAY DATA ANALYSIS
Jennifer Pei-Kay Gee
Frederick High School, Frederick, Maryland, United States

Because tumors express telomerase activity and normal cell tissue does not, this study investigates the response of telomerase regulation to leukemic cells induced by anti-cancer drug retinoic acid. In elucidating the role of telomerase regulation, microarrays, a new bioinformatics technology, was employed to accurately measure genetic activity. A second goal of this project was to develop an efficient data-mining protocol to maximize the amount of biological information that can be extracted from massive microarray datasets. <br><br>Microarrays have become increasingly important because of their ability to simultaneously monitor expression levels of thousands of genes. Gathered via Affymetrix U95 Genechips, expression levels of leukemic cells treated with retinoic acid were analyzed using mathematical techniques such as normalization and clustering.<br><br>A mathematical approach outlining methods to filter unreliable data points for the effective analysis of microarray data was developed. Through this general protocol the analysis revealed that the retinoic acid treatment resulted in apoptosis and the down regulation of telomerase activity. A number of genes implicated in telomerase regulation, e.g. c-Myc, Ets, and Id proteins, were significantly modulated. Fold calculations have shown about 200 genes that modulated more than 5-fold; the most significantly down regulated genes function in tumorigenesis and cell differentiation. Cluster analysis of 8,000 genes with reliable expression levels has indicated four distinct biological patterns of inflection. These results suggest an optimized approach for future microarray studies, as well as a better understanding of how to develop telomerase-targeted leukemic therapy.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to see if a diet supplemented with blueberry juice would help improve the motor coordination, balance, and motor learning in mice 51 weeks old. My hypothesis was that supplementing the diet with blueberry juice would improve the motor coordination, balance, and motor learning in the mice.<br><br>Two groups of mice were maintained under the same environmental conditions. The diets of both groups were the same, with the exception of the variable group whose diet was supplemented with blueberry juice. The mice were placed on a rotarod. The rotarod was turned by hand at a speed which kept the mouse between the guide marks. Each rotation was timed and recorded.<br><br>The results show little differnce between the control and variable groups during the first nine days of the experiment. The control group averaged seven seconds per rotation for the first nine days. The variable group’s average was slightly higher. Days ten, eleven, and twelve showed marked improvement in the rotarod rotation time for both groups. The blueberry group showed the greatest improvement and maintained their times better.<br><br>At this time my research does not indicate that blueberry juice enhances the motor coordination, balance, and motor learning in mice 51 weeks old. Further testing is necessary to determine if anything of significance is taking place during the twenty- three day testing period. A new set of mice are needed to see if there is repeatability in the data already collected. <br><br>

The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that the anticoagulant properties of Oxalis debilis (clover) plant extract will not affect the behavior of Mus musculus nor produce physiological changes to it. A biochemical analysis of the plant extract was also performed. <br><br>The groups consisted of five (5) experimental female and five (5) male mice and groups of five (5) male and five (5) female mice. The dose that was applied to the mice was 0.8 ml of plant extract. The group of mice received the dose during five (5) days a week for three (3) consecutive weeks during a specific period of time. Their behavior, physical changes, weight and body temperature were observed. During the investigation there was no damage in the physical behavior. There was not a dramatic changes or significant differences between the weight and the temperature according to statical test of the regression fit. The biochemical analysis of the plant extract evidenced that there are five(5) active ingredients. <br><br>At the end of the treatment mice of both groups euthanized, necropsies were performed to mice of each group to observe mayor internal organs. Therefore, there is possibility of using Oxalis debilis(clover) plant as an anticoagulant agent. Future projections include histological studies in order to determine if there has been any damage at the cellular level. <br><br>

This project is a continuation from a previous year. In this prject the researcher examines the behavioral, physiological, and physical effects of cigarette smoke on Drosophila Melanogaster. The researcher used 300 fruit flies and separaed them into 10 different vials and exposed them to a variety of variables. Some of these variables include: a range of cigarette smoke (0.5-2.5 cc) and various environments such as the uses of liquid smoke, filtered and non-filtered cigarette smoke, as well as culture and solid fruit. In this project the researcher used the offspring of the initial project as well as the offspring of the parents exposed to the exact same elements as were present in the initial experiment. The purpose of this project is to see there is a correlation between cigarette smokes and some of the effects, shaking and disorientation, of diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.

CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOSENSITIZING AGENTS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY'S EFFECTS ON ERYTHROCYTES
Jaclyn Rachel Silbermann
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA, United States of America

Photodynamic Therapy (PTD), an extremely potent cancer treatment process that utilizes high-intensity light coupled with photosensitizing agents, has certain harmful side effects, including reversal effects of the process on healthy membrane. This research explored methods of improving the efficiency of the PTD process.<br><br> Studies of Potassium (K+) leakage for erythrocyte (red blood cell) membranes, combined with one of two sensitizing agents (Hematoporphyrin or Protoporphyrin IX), after exposure to three different periods of high-intensity light were analyzed. Cells were subjected to light for different periods of exposure. Measurements of K+ released by the cells into the free media were analyzed by Flame Photometry every five minutes for a period of twenty minutes. Before the fifth measurement was taken cells were lysed to determine the full amount of K+ in the total cellular membrane. The patterns of cell leakage for all periods of exposure were compared.<br><br> Additional experimentation was done to determine the precise cause of the cell leakage. Comparative induced leak sizes were tested in an effort to determine if the leak sizes were the cause of the different patterns of leakage due to duration of exposure. <br><br> A period of exposure between 60 and 90 minutes produces the maximum leakage, and any further exposure will induce very minimal additional damage. There was a statistically significant difference between exposures of 10 minutes or less and exposures of 60 minutes or more (data was statistically analyzed at the 0.05 level of significance). It was also determined that longer exposure of the cell membrane to light yields greater leak sizes.<br><br> <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE INDOOR POOL ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION OF COMPETITIVE SWIMMERS
Sarah Elizabeth Gutman
Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, Wheeling West Virginia, USA

The experiment monitored the environment of the indoor pool to determine its effects on the respiratory function of competitive swimmers. The hypothesis was that chloramines, especially nitrogen trichloride, (NCl3) would be present and that some swimmers would show decreased respiratory function after practicing in this environment. The chloramines form from a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the pool and the ammonia from sweat and body proteins of the swimmer. <br><br> Over a period of three months encompassing the swim season, the pool water was tested for the presence of chloramines using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. Concentrations of the chloramines were determined using a standard curve. High school and college swimmers completed a survey on their respiratory and swimming history and measured their peak expiratory flow before and after practice to determine their respiratory function. The data was analyzed for connections between the indoor pool environment and the respiratory function of the swimmers. <br><br> A link between the presence of chloramines in the indoor pool environment and decreased respiratory function and higher incidence of asthma was displayed. Swimmers exhibited decreased respiratory function when the chloramine levels were higher; for one swimmer, reentry to the environment after a period away resulted in a steady decrease in respiratory function. A much higher percentage of swimmers than the national average reported asthma, and all but one were swimming regularly before diagnosis. The incidence of respiratory symptoms such as coughing, or chest tightness was 86% in the college swimmers. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE ON THE UTILIZATION OF CREATINE IN MICE
Jenna Marie Schoof
Merlo Station High School, Beaverton, OR. USA

Creatine monohydrate is a widely-used dietary supplement. Fitness experts believe it significantly augments "energy" or endurance levels in athletes during cardiovascular activity. However, no evidence has been produced to support this theory in scientific literature. The purpose of this study was to determine if insulin release, induced by glucose injections given prior to exercise, increased creatine uptake by muscles resulting in higher energy levels. In these experiments, energy levels in mice treated with a creatine-supplemented diet were compared to mice fed the standard diet, with or without glucose administration. Experimental results were examined by a series of pair-wise comparisons. The results showed that mice fed creatine-supplemented diets along with excipient injections had less energy compared to mice fed the standard diet, following injection with excipient (p < 0.05). Glucose injections given prior to exercise did not increase energy levels in mice fed the standard diet, showing that glucose alone did not influence energy levels (p = 0.84). Finally, my results indicated that mice fed a creatine-supplemented diet had more energy when injected with glucose prior to exercise than controls injected with excipient (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the combination of glucose and creatine supplementation promoted enhanced energy levels in mice during cardiovascular activity.

POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE PPAR-GAMMA-2 PRO12ALA POLYMORPHISM IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Nikhil Atul Shukla, White Station High School
Memphis, TN 38117, USA

Many factors, both genetic and external, contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent evidence shows that in certain foam cells of artherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-2 (PPAR-gamma-2) is highly expressed. PPAR-gamma-2 is a transcription factor involved in glucose and lipid metabolism as well as inflammatory response. A common Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPAR-gamma-2 gene has been extensively studied for its relationship with type 2 diabetes. However, this particular polymorphism has not been studied for its relationship with CAD. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine if there is a relationship between the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPAR-gamma-2 and susceptibility to CAD. The PPAR-gamma-2 gene was genotyped in an array of patients using the relatively new technique, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic DNA samples were obtained from Caucasian patients (n = 259) and African-American patients (n = 130) who had undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The genotyping results obtained from the CABG patients were compared to Caucasian healthy controls (n = 94) and African-American healthy controls (n = 124). Analysis of the genotypes of the Caucasian CABG patients showed that the frequency of the Ala/Ala mutant allele was unusually high, thus creating Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. The genotypes of the Caucasian healthy controls, African American CABG patients, and African-American healthy controls were all within the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Thus, this study shows that the mutant form of the PPAR-gamma-2 Pro12Ala polymorphism plays a potential role in the susceptibility to coronary artery disease.

HOW DO VITAMINS AFFECT THE GROWTH OF STREPTOCOCCUS BACTERIA?
Andrew Jongho Sun
Washington High School, Tacoma, WA, U.S.A

This investigation's purpose was to find out how different vitamins at different concentrations affect streptococcus bacteria growth. Vitamins are known to help the immune system, especially vitamins that are antioxidants which are known to aid in the treatment of certain illnesses at high doses. However, the current recommended daily allowance (RDA) is said to be too small.<br><br> In this study, streptococcus salivarius was used as the model for streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus salivarius is the non-pathogenic bacteria found in the human mouth. Streptococcus pyogenes is the pathogenic bacteria that causes strep throat.<br><br> The bacteria were exposed to vitamins A, C, and E at 100% and 200% RDA and then allowed to grow. The hypothesis predicted that vitamin C at 200% RDA would be the most effective at decreasing the growth of streptococcus bacteria. In order to expose the bacteria to the vitamins, LB nutrient broth, streptococcus salivarius, and vitamin A, C, or E at either 100% or 200% RDA were mixed together in an epitube. After placing 30microliters of the solution onto the surface of the agar and spreading the solution evenly, the bacteria growth was measured daily by counting the number of colonies on the petri dishes.<br><br> It was found that at the 100% RDA level, vitamin A was the most effective at reducing bacterial growth. At the 200% RDA level, vitamin E was slightly more effective than vitamin C, but both of the vitamins were more effective than vitamin A.

THE EFFECTS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS ON THE HEART RATE OF DAPHNIA
Johni Beth Gibbs
Harmony Grove High School, Haskell-Benton, Arkansas, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if the heart rate of Daphnia is affected when they are exposed to certain over-the-counter health enhancing supplements. After data was gathered, a T-Test was performed to validate the results.<br><br> There is reason to believe, if the supplements are given properly, there will be little change in the heart rate of Daphnia.<br><br> The Daphnia was placed on a glass slide and the heart rate was observed for one minute. The the flea was placed on another glass slide that contained one of the five supplements used in this project<br><br>(Calcium, Caffeine, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and L-Glutathonione). The heart rate was again counted for one minute. All calculations were recorded in the data table and graphed. <br><br> After the supplements were added it was found that there were large variations in the heart rate of the Daphnia. When the T-Test were run the mean and median were determined and the statistcs were calculated. The probability of the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis, is .005. Suggesting that there is a .005 chance that the outcome will be similar to the observed results if more tests were run. The wide margins of the heart rates were not due to chance, but were due to the addition of the supplements. Therefore the null hypothesis, there will be little change in the heart rate of Daphnia, was rejected.<br><br> <br><br><br>

DETERMINING A CORRELATION BETWEEN SALIVARY CORTISOL CONCENTRATIONS, SOCIO- ECONOMIC CLASSES, AND AT-RISK SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN
Chelsea Ray Keeney
School of the Osage High School, Kaiser, Missouri, United States of America

Cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland, has been linked to depression and aggressive behavior. Boys with behavioral problems and consistently low cortisol levels exhibit three times the number of aggressive symptoms as their same aged counterparts who have higher or fluctuating cortisol concentrations (McBurnett, 2000). These findings suggest a correlation between salivary cortisol and aggressive behavior.<br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate a correlation between salivary cortisol concentrations, socio-economic classes, and aggressive behavior in boys. It was hypothesized that participants having ascertainably lower salivary cortisol concentrations would manifest aggressive behaviors. It was also hypothesized that participants with ascertainably higher salivary cortisol concentrations would belong to low income socio-economic groups.<br><br> Fifty randomly selected boys, aged five to twelve, received a home-life survey and a saliva collection kit, both completed/conducted with parental assistance. Survey questions were compiled to produce results to determine if aggressive behaviors, parental income and marital status were related to salivary cortisol levels. Behaviors and income were analyzed, then compared to the participant’s salivary cortisol levels.<br><br> Results of this study indicate that those participants with statistically higher salivary cortisol concentrations exhibited aggressive behaviors (P=0.01), and belonged to lower socio-economic classes (P=0.01). Those participants with ascertainably higher salivary cortisol concentrations had higher paternal alcohol consumption (P=0.02), and lower maternal education (P=0.05). These findings suggest that children with atypical salivary cortisol concentrations may excessively internalize (withdrawal) or externalize (become aggressive) behavior. These results contradict previous research that lower salivary cortisol is associated with aggressive behavior.

A DNA MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF HUMAN LEUKEMIA CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Megan Clarke Roberts, 320 Glendale Street, Carlisle, PA, USA 17013
Carlisle High School, Carlisle, PA, USA 17013

This project was designed to examine changes in the levels of gene expression as rapidly dividing human leukemia cells are induced to differentiate into non-dividing macrophage-like cells. DNA microarray analysis was used to examine the expression of 1,127 genes by isolating total RNA from untreated cells and cells treated with the macrophage differentiation inducer PMA (a phorbol ester), converting the RNA to labeled, single-strand cDNA and hybridization to the arrays. Hybridization signals were quantitated using phosphorimager and image analysis software. The expression of some of the genes was unchanged, however, a number of genes were down-regulated (turned off) and a number of genes were significantly up-regulated (turned on). Two genes that were noted to have changed was the DIM 1, which was down regulated and controlled cell division, and the TPT 1 which was up regulated and controls apoptosis. Targeting these genes in cancer patients could lead to possible leukemia treatments. The identity of the changing genes was determined and their role in macrophage differentiation is discussed.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY EXERCISE THE EFFECTS ON BIMANUAL COORDINATION
Ellen Marie Pitman, Central Bucks West High School
Doyelstown, PA, United States of America

This experiment explored the affects of lower extremity exercise on bimanual coordination. The postulate is that when both sides of the body are used there is communication between both hemispheres of the brain, with the prediction of improving immediate bimanual coordination following lower extremity exercise. <br><br> The test size was sixty subjects, ages thirteen to eighteen. The sixty subjects were assigned to an experimental group of thirty subjects and a control group of thirty subjects. An exercise program was created that emphasized an equal number of right and left lower extremity movements. The Purdue Pegboard was used to test each subject’s bimanual coordination. Directly following the bimanual coordination test, the subjects in the experimental group participated in the lower extremity exercise. The subjects in the control group received the same visual and auditory input, but did not do the lower extremity exercise. After the exercise all of the subjects again had their bimanual coordination tested.<br><br> The data from the experimental group shows that twenty-seven subjects improved in coordination compared to the eighteen in the control group. In the experimental group, three maintained the same average coordination, and five in the control group. There were seven control subjects whose coordination decreased following the visual input, compared to zero subjects in the experimental group. By use of a T-test it was determined that the data that was gathered for the experimental group was highly statistically significant (P=4.1 x 10-8). When the T-test was performed on the control group, the data was slightly statistically significant (P = .007). The T-test on both sets of data indicates that the use of bilateral lower extremity exercise is effective in improving bimanual coordination.<br><br>

DAMNACANTHAL AND THE CYTOSKELETON: NONI ANTHRAQUINONE NORMALIZES CANCER CELL PHENOTYPE
Jill Shizuko Harunaga
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA

The cancer cell phenotype is affected by various cancer genes (oncogenes). The ras oncogene is a GTP-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of cell growth and morphology. It has been reported that inhibition of ras activity by damnacanthal, an anthraquinone isolated from Morinda citrifolia (noni), results in a more normal morphology. This research investigates the mechanism of damnacanthal’s effect on the growth and morphology of ras-transformed cells. It is hypothesized that damnacanthal modifies the formation of microfilament bundles (MFB) and/or their origin in the focal adhesion sites. Fluorescent TRITC-Phalloidin revealed that the density of MFB does not vary between control and treated cells, but that damnacanthal treatment increased the formation of MFB. SDS-PAGE analysis of triton-glycerol-resistant proteins revealed that the adhesion site was significantly enriched with actin. Because damnacanthal is known to inhibit the activity of various tyrosine protein kinases, it was hypothesized that the mechanism by which it stabilizes the cytoskeleton is through the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase, src. Src is know to phosphorylate the focal adhesion site protein, paxillin. Damnacanthal treatment of v-src-transformed cells resulted in a significant inhibition of their growth accompanied by an increase in MFB formation. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis of paxillin demonstrated that damnacanthal significantly affects the distribution but not the amount of paxillin. Thus, inhibition of paxillin phosphorylation stabilizes MFBs and blocks the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade arresting cells in early G1 of the cell cycle. The anticancer effects of damnacanthal were not due to its reported effects on the ras-oncogene, but rather through its inhibition of the src tyrosine protein kinase and the stabilizating effects on the cytoskeleton.<br><br>

USING BIOINFORMATICS AS A TOOL TO DETERMINE IF THE ALU GENE IS RELATED TO ETHNIC BACKGROUND!
Eni Cani
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA, USA

This experiment examines PV92, a human-specific Alu insertion on chromosome 16. Scientists regard Alu insertion as an example of "selfish DNA" because it encodes no protein and appears to exist only for its own replication. They believe that these transposable elements have played an important role in evolution by creating new mutations and gene combinations. <br><br>A survey of 22 individuals of different ethnicities was done to show if the presence of the Alu gene correlated to ethnic background. Subjects were asked to give samples of DNA and anonymously asked for their ethnicity. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed to replicate all DNA samples and gel electrophoresis was done to separate out the DNA and determine the genotype of each subject. The PV92 gene has two alleles indicating the presence (+) or absence (-) of the Alu transposable element on each of the paired chromosomes. This results in three PV92 genotypes (++, +-, or --). <br><br>Their data was then inserted into the database of a bioinformatic research center to study variations within this small population. Also this will allowed comparisons of this sample set with groups from all over the world. The database computed algorithms by using programs that made fast calculations and produced important graphs needed for results. Results show that the Alu gene is not related to ethnicity, but a high proportion of the gene is seen more in Chinese population. <br><br><br><br><br>

INITIAL ISOLATION, CULTURE, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SPORE-LIKE CELLS FROM RAT BRAIN
Jillian Alexandra Berry
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro, Massachusetts, USA

This tissue engineering study qualitatively characterized cultured neural Spore-like progenitor cells (SLCs) to demonstrate their potential to form neurons and act as adult multipotent stem cells. SLCs from adult rat brain were isolated and cultured using Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to promote cell differentiation. Cell samples from different days were stained with immunofluorescent antibodies for the presence of specific markers: Nestin for neural stem cells, beta-Tubulin III for neurons, GFAP for glia, and DAPI for nucleic acids. A second culture replicated the previous results with and without FBS, and also looked for Notch1 antibody. Presence of Notch1 supports the potential of neural SLCs to be co-cultured with a Notch ligand from Delta-producing fibroblasts to establish an epidermal instead of neural cell fate. If no Notch was present, cultures could be transfected with a Notch intracellular domain plasmid to potentially produce the same effects. <br><br> The first culture showed Nestin present by day 7, and shortly after Tubulin appeared, even before FBS was added. Later Nestin disappeared. GFAP was observed. Therefore, cultured SLC’s from adult rat brain differentiate through a neural stem cell phase into neurons. The second culture replicated these results and identified Notch1 in the cultures as early as day 0. These results support the feasibility of neural SLCs cells in culture being presented with the Delta ligand or intracellular Notch1 and shifting their cell fate from neural to epidermal. This would prove the multipotentiality of SLCs and have implications for them as a replacement to embryonic stem cells.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF TROPOELASTIN AND FIBULIN-5 IN CUTIS LAXA: PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT PROTEINS BY EXPRESSION CLONING
Kiani Anela Jeniah Arkus
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu HI, USA

Cutis laxa (CL) is a clinical condition characterized by loose and inelastic skin and also involving pulmonary artery stenosis and emphysema. Previous research has demonstrated altered elastic fibers in CL patients apparently due to mutations of the tropoelastin gene (ELN). Also, a CL-like phenotype was expressed in fibulin-5 (FBLN5) knockout mice. Thus the genes for the tropoelastin and fibulin-5 proteins of the extracellular matrix were identified as prime candidates for the study of CL. This research project aims to express normal and the CL mutant variants of the human tropoelastin and fibulin-5 genes in E. coli. Human cDNA for each of these genes are cloned into expression vectors and used to transform E. coli expressing additional copies of argU and proL tRNA due to the high percentage of these amino acids in the fibulin-5 and tropoelastin proteins. Resulting proteins will be used to study the interactions between fibulin-5 and tropoelastin in cell growth, spreading, morphology, and substrate adhesion. The ELN gene was successfully cloned into bacteria and expressed and purified by affinity chromatography. Protein analysis determined an unusual frequency of certain amino acids within the protein, making quantification difficult. Treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with the GST-tropoelastin fusion protein caused a flattening and spreading of cells not seen in various control. The FBLN5 plasmid construct is yet to be cloned into bacterial cells.

NEUROEXCITOTOXICITY VS. APOPTOSIS IN INFLAMMATORY INDUCED P5 LONG EVANS RATTUS TISSUE
Brandon Tramell Mack 
Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences, Hot Springs Ar, United States 

Multiple lines of independent investigation have linked neonatal interventions with alterations in brain development of neonates that ultimately lead to abnormal subsequent behaviors, suggesting that these changes result from either apoptosis or excitotoxic damage to highly susceptible immature neurons. Using mechanistic explanations of the underlying mechanisms to substantiate these clinical observations, this experiment investigated the mechanisms mediating such changes in the developing brain using P5 Long Evans rat brain tissue. A novel hypothesis was projected to describe the link between neonatal sensory experiences and alterations in brain development: increased stimulation in Long Evans P5 rats resulting from prolonged nocioceptive activity during the neonatal period results in NMDA induced excitotoxic damage in multiple regions of the developing brain. Extracted Long Evans P5 rat-pup protein tissue was compared across four treatment groups using Western Immunoblot analysis. PARP, an antibody that facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis, was blotted for each treatment group: Control, Ketamine, Ketamine & Formalin, and Formalin. The western blots were developed as radiograph film images. Using MCID™ computer imaging densitometry test, protein expression of the PARP antibody were quantified by assigning each protein sample a relative optical density (ROD) value. Instat® ANOVA statisitcal analysis of the average ROD values for each treatment group showed minimal variation. The results showed no significant difference in enhanced cellular death resulting from apoptosis mechanisms across treatment groups. This suggested that the cellular death resulting from prolonged neonatal pain can not be attributed to apoptotic mechanisms; therefore, the hypothesis was supported suggesting that the degree of cellular death resulting from prolonged nociception must be attributed to NMDA induced excitotoxic cellular death.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF  PLASMID VECTOR ENCODING POLYPEPTIDE FOR DRUG DELIVERY TO CANCEROUS TISSUE. 
Soumo DE
St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, Mississippi, USA

The goal of this project was to develop a targeted approach to deliver anti-sense dioxinucleotides (as an anti-cancer drug) corresponding to an oncogene that is expressed in a specific tumor. To achieve it a plasmid construct, which encodes the  polypeptide, would carry the drug (anti-sense DNA).<br><br> A thermally sensitive polypeptide gene sequence (elastin like polypeptide, ELP) was annealed with a polylysine code at one end and a RGD tripeptide sequence specific for integrin, on other end. First a pet - 25 plasmid was digested with two endonucleases, Nde-I and Bam-H I.  The 5500 base pair digestion product was joined to RGD-Sfi I-polylysine sequence by ligation.  Another plasmid, puc 19, was treated with two nucleases (Bgl-I and Pfl-I) to excise ELP. This ELP was joined to the RGD-polylysine construct at the Sfi-I site.  Another Sfi-I digestion was carried out to inactivate plasmids that lacked the insert.<br><br> Esherichia coli BLR cells were transformed using cloned plasmid.  Following incubation, the cells were lysed. The cell lysate was  harvested, sonicated and a sample from each of purification steps was assayed by protein gel electrophoresis. ELP protein was not detected in any of the purification steps, indicating that plasmid was unable to express. It is very likely that expression of the protein was inhibited because of presence of multiple  residues of polylysine, which may cause misreading of the inserted gene. Alternate approaches will be sought to create  constructs without polylysine for expression in E. coli cells.

THE EFFECT OF BOTULINUM TOXIN ON TRIGEMINAL CELLS
Ryan John Cady
Greenwood Lab School, Springfield, MO, USA

Recent studies have shown that botulinum toxin may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches. The mechanism by which this occurs is currently unknown. Historically, botulinum toxin has been shown to inhibit acetylcholine release from nerve cells leading to muscle paralysis. Current studies have explored the possibility that botulinum toxin is affecting neuropeptides involved in pain transmission. A new hypothesis about the effects of botulinum toxin sensory neurons is being created. The hypothesis is that botulinum toxin may block the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a crucial role in providing sensory input from the skin, muscles, connective tissue and blood vessels. Trigeminal cells were stimulated with KCl and Capsaicin which caused the cells to release CGRP. The cells were then treated with botulinum toxin to study the effect of the toxin on CGRP release. The study showed a significant decrease in the amount of CGRP secretion from stimulated trigeminal nerve cells. This provides a previously unknown mechanism for the effectiveness of botulinum toxin in treating migraine.

USING BIOINFORMATICS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS ON DISEASE
Nicholas Paul Semenkovich, Ladue High School
St. Louis, MO, USA

Individual variations in the genetic code hold the promise of providing mechanisms to explain differences in physical characteristics, disease susceptibility, and sensitivities to the side effects of medications. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common DNA sequence variants that appear in similar patterns among people of the same ethnicity and race. SNPs are thought to be associated with diverse diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease. In recent news, AIDS vaccine trials failed among Caucasians, but showed signs of success in Asians and African Americans, prompting some to implicate SNPs in immune system genes as responsible for this race-specific difference. The utility of SNPs is compromised by their frequency. They are common and may represent true differences in protein structure, linkage disequilibrium with other genetic loci, or innocuous differences. To test the hypothesis that computer algorithms can predict the potential usefulness of SNPs, I wrote >2,000 lines of PERL code running under the Redhat Linux 8.0 operating system to define the links between known SNPs and disease markers. Using available SNP and disease databases, I used a novel protocol to determine: areas of overlap between SNPs and disease markers, sites where SNPs fall within exons of disease markers, and nonsynonymous SNPs (those causing amino acid changes). These studies provide proof of concept that bioinformatics can help bridge the gap between descriptive data from the human genome and clinically relevant issues such as the genetic propensity to develop disease.

CURCUMIN AND GENISTIN: POTENTIAL NATURAL AGENTS FOR TREATMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA
David Nima Meigooni
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY 40502, USA

Glioblastomas represent 25% of intracranial tumors. Although radiation therapy can treat a variety of intracranial tumors, it can also have adverse effects on normally functioning portions of the brain, such as the optic chiasm, brainstem, and motory system. Therefore, there is a desire to use a cell sensitizer, especially those of natural compounds such as curcumin and genistin, that could make the brain cancer cells to be more sensitive to radiation, and hence reducing the amount of radiation needed for treatment of brain cancer patients.<br><br> The goal of this experiment is to determine the effect of genistin, curcumin, combination of genistin and curcumin, and radiation on the U87-MG glioblastoma cell line. This information is vital for determination of the radiosensitizing ability of these natural compounds, which will be measured through colony forming assay. The final results were expressed as a cell survival fraction (SF). The results of these investigations had indicated that the cell survival fractions of glioblastoma for radiation alone was measured and the SF2 was found to be approximately 0.5. Moreover, both curcumin and genistin had shown cell kill properties on glioblastoma. The SF for 2 micro Molar concentrations of curcumin and genistin were 0.4 and 0.7, respectively. Addition of 2 micro Molar of curcumin prior to genistin treatment increased cell kill of genistin by 18%. This effect was proven to be statistically significant by virtue of a t-test, which yielded a p-value of 0.02. The combination of radiation with genistin or curcumin remains to be explored.<br><br>

GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF SYNOVIAL CELLS IN RESPONSE TO IMPULSIVE SHOCK
Irene Yuan Sun
Ben Davis High School, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease that causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. This disease currently affects 2.1 million Americans, and this number is expected to increase due to the aging population. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are one of the most influential proteinases in joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. Mechanical stress is known to alter MMP expression, which is controlled by many regulatory DNA elements immediately preceding the coding sequences. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of impulsive shock on matrix destruction in rheumatoid and normal synovial cells and identify DNA regulatory elements responsible for the shock responses. Cells were loaded with impulsive shock, and mRNA expressions of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs), as well as MMP activities, were determined using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and fibril degradation assays. A comparison of normal cells to rheumatoid cells revealed that in response to shock, rheumatoid cells have heightened MMP expression, lower TIMP expression, and higher MMP activity than their normal counterparts. A unique computational tool to search for critical DNA regulatory elements among all possible 4-, 5-, and 6-base-pair-length binding motifs predicted that 5’-AGAGG-3’ is an important mediator of impulsive shock. This cis-acting DNA element coincides with the known regulatory factor RXR (DR-1), and both promoter competition (PROCO) and gel shift assays confirmed its upregulating role in synovial cells’ MMP shock responses. In conclusion, rheumatoid normal synovial cells are more sensitive to impulsive shock than normal cells, and the stimulatory role of 5’-AGAGG-3’ contributes to shock-induced MMP regulation.

DISSOLUTION OF ACETAMINOPHEN DOSAGE FORMS
Rachel Marie Aipperspach, Wishek Public School
Wishek, North Dakota, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to show that there are differences in dissolution times between different dosage forms, brands, pH levels, and presence of an antacid. The dissolution rate was determined on 7 different dosage forms; Brand A gelcaps, Brand A geltabs, Brand A caplets, and Brand A tablets, Brand B caplets, Brand B tablets, and Brand B gelcaps. Each of these dosage forms were dissolved in water (pH 7), water and HCl acid (pH 2), and HCl acid and an antacid (pH 4). The dissolution time of each dosage form for each solution was recorded.<br><br>The dissolution rate was different between dosage forms, with geltabs and gelcaps dissolving at a slower rate in both the water solution pH 7 and the HCl acid solution pH 2. There was no significant difference between the rate of dissolution of the same dosage form between the water solution pH 7 and the HCl acid solution pH 2.<br><br>The rate of dissolution was affected by the presence of an antacid in the HCl acid solution. Brand B gelcaps showed a significant increase in dissolution time when placed in a solution containing an antacid.<br><br>This project shows that the speed of relief for pain when taking acetaminophen will be affected by dosage form. In addition when taken in combination with an antacid the dissolution of acetaminophen maybe greatly retarded depending on the dosage form, thus limiting its effectiveness as a pain reliever.

GLUCOSE AS A TERATOGEN AFFECTING CRANIAL NEURAL CREST MIGRATION IN THE CHICK EMBRYO
Henry Louis Marr, Alhambra High School
Alhambra CA, USA

Infants born to diabetic mothers are five times as likely to be born with developmental defects. Predominantly consisting of craniofacial and cardiovascular malformations, these defects are sometimes fatal and lead one to wonder why these infants are more prone to abnormalities. Since glucose accumulates within the placenta, can glucose itself be considered the substance causing these defects, in essence labeling glucose as a teratogen? If so, how does glucose in high concentrations bring about these defects? I propose that glucose does indeed act as a teratogen and that it induces these defects by inhibiting the migratory abilities of neural crest, a population of cells that differentiate into components of the peripheral nervous system and parts of the craniofacial skeleton.<br><br> After incubating fertilized chick embryos until the proper stage had been obtained (4, 7, and 8), in vitro (New culture) and in vivo (window culture) methods of culture were performed to gain access. By injecting varying concentrations of glucose directly into the embryo or into the surrounding albumen, the effects of abnormal concentrations of glucose on the developing chick were documented. The administration of Amiloride in culture (similar procedure) allowed for the examination of uPA inhibition and neural crest migration inhibition effects.<br><br> Results show that glucose at high concentrations (~0.36M) induces both craniofacial and cardiovascular defects; open neural tubes were most common. Surprisingly, the inhibition of uPA also caused open neural tubes in addition to inhibiting crest. I conclude that glucose causes developmental deformities by inhibiting the migration of neural crest.<br><br>

EFFECT OF NEEM (AZADIRACHTA INDICA) SEED OIL ON MOUSE BREAST CANCER CELL LINE
Arjun Simon Sebastian
Lakeside High School, Evans, Georgia, U.S.A.

Breast cancer affects one in nine women and it claims 43,000 lives a year. This study investigated the effect of Neem seed oil on a mouse breast tumor cell line. Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a tropical tree, which is considered to have medicinal properties by traditional medical practitioners in India. Neem extract has been shown to inhibit the growth of buccal cancer in hamsters and human glioblastoma cell lines through enzyme inhibition. The glioblastoma study also established a possible connection between neem and DNA damage. It was hypothesized that neem seed oil will inhibit breast cancer tumor cell growth and that one of the mechanisms of this inhibition of growth is apoptosis. Mouse breast cancer tumor cells were cultured and then exposed with 1:200, 1:100, 1:50 dilutions of the neem seed oil. Cells were taken out, fixed, and stained at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours and the number of cells were counted. A DNA Fragmentation kit was used to test for apoptosis. Cell growth was inhibited at dilutions of 1:200 (p = 0.01), 1:100 (p < 0.0001) and 1:50 (p < 0.0001). The data was analyzed to determine whether there was dose dependent inhibition of tumor cell growth. Dose dependence was found as cell growth linear regression separates significantly from each other, at all different dilutions (p<0.0001). Apoptosis was found, though not in statistically significant amounts. This study clearly shows neem’s effectiveness in the possible treatment of breast cancer. Further studies are needed to demonstrate this effect in human breast tumor cells.

MECHANISMS BY WHICH LYME DISEASE AND CANCER CELLS INVADE THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
Parmita Pradip Dalal
Shawnee Mission Northwest High School, Shawnee, KS, USA. 

Lyme disease is caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and by some mechanism enters the central nervous system (CNS). Cancer metastasis, or the spreading of cancer cells, to the brain is one of the most rapidly increasing causes of death in patients with sytemic cancers. In order for microorganims to enter CNS, they must first cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is permeable only to few compounds and denies access to drugs and pathogens. The primary goal of this research was to determine the mechanisms by which enzymes facilitate the invasion of the CNS. It was hypothesized that the enzymes of the fibrinolytic system and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) aid in the breakdown of the BBB, allowing access to the CNS. Using a novel in vitro model of the BBB to study the transmigration of spirochetes, it was found that both the fibrinolytic system and MMPs play a role in the breakdown of the BBB and are induced under similar proteolytic pathways. Subsequently, it was found that brain microvascular endothelial cells, the cells that make up the BBB, secrete plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator receptors in response to B. burgdorferi and SK-Mel melanoma cells. The BBB goes through a self-destructive process by activating degradative enzymes of the fibrinolytic system in response to invading cells.

HISTONE PROTEIN PROMOTION WITH TRICHOSTATIN A ON GENE EXPRESSION OF HUMAN BLADDER AND PROSTATE CANCER CELLS
Samantha Megan Feingold

HISTONE PROTEIN PROMOTION WITH TRICHOSTATIN A ON GENE EXPRESSION OF HUMAN BLADDER AND PROSTATE CANCER CELLS<br><br>Feingold, Samantha M.<br><br>7410 Sedona Way, Delray Beach, FL. 33446<br><br>Spanish River Community High School, Boca Raton, Florida<br><br>The genetic pathways of bladder and prostate cancer are poorly understood, however, it is known that certain genes are down-regulated in both cancers. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are potent inducers of apoptosis, modulators of transcription, exhibit anti-proliferative effects and have the ability to restore gene expression in certain instances. This study was designed to evaluate an HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) and its effects on urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas UM-UC-3, T24, and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. These cells were treated with 15, 50, 75, 100 ìl/mol, and 800 ng/ml of TSA for 48 hours. Total RNA from the TSA-treated cells were isolated and fluorescently labeled with Cyanine 3 and Cyanine 5 using reverse transcription and hybridized to 9000 gene cDNA microarrays. The characteristic emission spectra were measured by laser excitation recording the absolute intensity of Cy5/Cy3. In both bladder cell lines UM-UC-3 and T24, TSA had no effect on cell proliferation. Statistical analysis on the LNCaP cell lines using log2 ratios and t-tests converted the data for cluster analysis revealing that TSA upregulated CDH1 and THBS2. These genes when down-regulated are associated with loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, angiogenesis and aggressive metastatic cancer thereby altering the potential for tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer. This study employed a novel approach that could serve as a model for rapid pre-clinical screening of drugs and their genetic effects on human cancer.<br><br>

INFRA RENAL AORTIC CONSTRICTION INDUCES CHANGE IN MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF CARDIAC CONTRACTION
Ansel Philip Amaral
Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach, FL, USA

Introduction: Cardiac contraction involves changes in the molecular confirmation of contractile proteins in response to intracellular changes in Ca2+ concentration. The formation of cross bridges (actin-myosin interaction) is the ultimate result of a strictly regulated interaction between these molecules in response to Ca2+-TnC (Troponin C) signaling. Cardiac hypertrophy can alter this response to Ca2+. <br><br>Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that cardiac hypertrophy induced by infra renal aortic banding could simulate cardiac hypertrophy induced by supra renal aortic banding.<br><br>Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were infra-renally banded and sacrificed 4 weeks after the banding occurred. Skinned cardiac fibers (contractile proteins) were prepared using 1% Triton-X and sacromere length (SL) was set at 1.9 mm in a relaxing solution. Thereafter, the fiber bundles were sequentially bathed in solutions of varying pCa (-log[Ca2+]) values (pCa ranging from 8.0 to 4.5) and isometric tension was recorded on a polygraph. SL was then changed to 2.3 mm and then recorded. To further investigate changes in calcium sensitivity, the fibers were exposed to 3 mm of the calcium sensitizer EMD 57033 at SL 2.3 mm and a third recording was completed.<br><br>Results: The pCa50 value (calcium concentration developing 50% of maximal tension) showed no difference at either SL between sham and banded skinned fibers. However, when these fibers were exposed to EMD 57033, the pCa50 was significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: Our results indicate that aortic constriction does not induce a variation between these groups in relation to length-dependent calcium activation. However, in the presence of EMD 57033, skinned fibers from hearts of banded rats exhibit a significant increase in calcium sensitivity indicating an alternative underlying molecular mechanism either in TnC- Ca2+ or actin-myosin interaction.

SIMULATING THE HERS STUDY IN AN IN-VIVO RAT MODEL: THE EFFECTS OF AGE ON THE EFFICACY OF ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT THERAPY
Philippe A. Bouchard
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama

Over 60 million Americans suffer from cardiovascular disease. The incidence of heart disease is lower in young women than in age-matched men, but rises steadily after menopause, thus denoting that gender related differences are mediated via estrogen. Although observational studies, such as HERS I and II illustrate estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) as an effective means of treating vascular disease in older women, various in-vivo experiments using the ballooon injury model support the vasoprotective effects of estrogen against neointimal proliferation. Simulated in a rat model, this experiment tests the hypothesis that a prolonged period between menopause and usage of ERT can nullify the beneficial side effects of estrogen.<br><br> Serial sections of occluded and non-occluded (control) vessels were obtained at 200 um intervals beginning 500 um proximal to the injury with the aid of a microtome (vessel samples were provided by qualified researchers). Morphometric analysis of digitalized images from each arterial segment was performed using image analysis software. Results support the vasoprotective effects of estrogen in young rats through comparison of neointima formation of ovariectomized cohorts treated with estrogen and those treated with vehicle. In the older cohorts, the length of time between ovariectomy and treatment with estrogen proved to be insignificant (P= 0.8745 for Intima/Media ratio) although results displayed a notable decrease in the medial areas of rats receiving immediate treatment of estrogen.

THE EFFECT OF (N-6):(N-3) FATTY ACID IN THE DEVOLPMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME
Dylan Joseph Dallarosa-Handrich
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY, USA

Since the 1950s, the formation of metabolic syndrome including obesity, lipid disorders, and hyperinsulinemia has dramatically increased in western society. During this time many people were influenced by the belief that a diet high in saturated fats leads to metabolic syndrome and adjusted their diets accordingly. The hypothesis is that an elevated Omega 6 (n-6, 18:2) fatty acid, Omega 3 (n-3, 18:3) fatty acid ratio will increase the risk factors of metabolic syndrome in rats. Eight groups of nine male Sprague Dawley rats were placed on eight experimental diets. Each group consumed a different diet containing eight different types of fat (grass-fed butter, lard and bison tallow, grain-fed butter, lard and bison tallow, 1:1 canola:olive oil blend and hydrogenated soybean oil). Blood samples were taken after thirty days on diet and analyzed using NMR technology to determine blood lipid properties, glucose-oxydase assay to determine fasting glucose levels and an insulin assay to determine the fasting insulin levels. The data shows a positive correlation between increased (n-6):(n-3) and the formation of metabolic syndrome. <br><br>

SILENCING CANCER WITH RNA: INDUCTION OF SELECTIVE APOPTOSIS IN CANCER CELLS THROUGH RNAI-MEDIATED MCL-1L DOWN-REGULATION
Anila Madiraju
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada

The objective of this project was to determine if RNA interference-mediated silencing of antiapoptotic Bc1-2 family protein Mcl-1L could selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the effectiveness of proapoptotic Mcl-1S. The effect of Mcl-1L down-regulation on susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics was tested. Liposomal formulation Intra-lipid was examined for its ability to deliver siRNAs to cells.<br><br> siRNAs were constructed (HiScribe RNAi Transcription Kit, NEB, Inc.) to target regions of exon 2 of the mcl-1 gene. Control siRNAs were made from Green Fluorescent Protein cDNA. mcl-1 siRNAs were tested for their ability to silence Mcl-1L production in MCF7, Sk-Mel5, OVCAR3, and RPMI-8226 cells. Toxicity of the siRNAs was examined in MRC5 cells. siRNAs were introduced into the cells using Novagen’s Ribojuice. Mcl-1L production was assessed by immunoblotting. Chemotherapeutics used were paclitaxel, camptothecin, and daunorubicin.<br><br> Results showed that mcl-1 siRNA significantly decreased Mcl-1L without affecting Mcl-1S production. Mcl-1 siRNA-B (0.5 ìg/well) induced 80-90% cell death in RPMI-8226, MCF7 and OVCAR3 cells and 50% cell death in SkMel5 cells, probably by enhancing the proapoptotic action of Mcl-1S. It also significantly increased the effectiveness of camptothecin and daunorubicin. Intra-lipid effectively delivered siRNA to OVCAR3 and RPMI-8226 cells inducing 45-55% apoptosis in cancer cells and lowering Mcl-1L levels in these cells.This research demonstrated that down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1L via RNAi can be adapted as a promising therapy against cancer. Because of its specificity, RNAi can prove to be advantageous over anticancer drugs, which have toxic side effects.

DIFFERENT CASPASES MEDIATE AGE-RELATED APOPTOSIS IN NEURONS COMPARED WITH ASTROCYTES
Yibo Yang
Palo Alto High School, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America

Apoptosis is a cell suicide program; however, effects of age and cell type on apoptosis in the brain are poorly understood. We induced apoptosis in both neurons and astrocytes of various ages. Neuron and astrocyte cultures were deprived of serum. To characterize DNA fragmentation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed. To identify apoptotic or necrotic cells in cultured cell population, Hoechst and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining were performed. Cell injury was quantified through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Caspase cleavage and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase phosphorylation were measured using immuno-blotting. Caspase 3, 8 and 9 were also inhibited in both cultures to determine its role in determining age-related differences. All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by two-tailed Student's t-test. Young neurons showed more apoptosis and greater caspases (essential protease for apoptosis) expressions compared to mature neurons. Mature neurons and astrocytes were found to be less vulnerable to serum deprivation and to undergo necrosis rather than apoptosis, which correlates with a lack of caspase activity and TUNEL-positive cells. Astrocytes showed condensed but non-fragmented nuclei and a different caspase expression. Caspase 3, 8, and 9 contribute to neuronal apoptosis while caspase 11 seems important to astrocytes. Our findings suggest that neurons and astrocytes utilize different apoptotic pathways as they develop and anti-apoptotic interventions against brain injury should be developmentally targeted and specific to cell type.

DOES CARBONATION AFFECT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE?
Alene Duersch
Orem High School, Orem Utah, USA

Athletic coaches often encourage their athletes to avoid the intake of carbonated beverages. This study was to evaluate the impact which the consumption of carbonation has upon the respiration and heart rates of athletes: specifically, distance runners. TI CBL systems and calculators, respiration belts, and gas sensors were used to evaluate respiration rates of each runner. Each of the twelve runners was instructed on the conditions of the three-week test, and agreed to comply. Respiration and heart rates were evaluated once after a week of no carbonated beverages, again a week later after consumption of a one liter Sprite® each day, and a third time, after yet another week without any carbonation. During the test, results for respiration rate were taken every 15 seconds, while heart rate was taken every minute. Data from the three weeks was compared and contrasted. From these results the conclusion that carbonated beverages on average, slightly increases respiration rate was made. The results also showed that carbonation seems to increase the heart rate of females and decrease the heart rate of males.

MODIFICATION OF EXPRESSION OF GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN AND PROTEIN KINASE C DELTA USING RNA INTERFERENCE IN HELA CELLS
Rahul Suresh
John Marshall High School, Rochester, MN, US

RNA interference (RNAi), the new technique of targeted degradation of mRNA induced by small interfering RNA (siRNA), allows us to study the function of proteins by specifically inhibiting their expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important cellular protein with numerous effector functions. There has been only one previous report of inhibition of the delta isoform of PKC using RNAi. The aims of this study were to inhibit expression of PKC delta after optimizing the technique of RNAi using green fluorescent protein (GFP) in HeLa cells. Protein expression was studied at 24 h using flow cytometry. Optimization studies showed that GFP transfection into HeLa cells was maximal when the cell confluence was 30-40%, when cells were grown in the absence of calf serum, and when the plasmid concentration was 1 microgram/well. Co-transfection of siRNA along with GFP plasmid into HeLa cells led to >75% drop in GFP expression, demonstrating successful inhibition of GFP expression by RNAi. Having optimized RNAi in HeLa cells using GFP as a target, we showed that PKC delta expression also appeared susceptible to this technique. However, inhibition of PKC delta expression by RNAi under these conditions was not statistically significant and requires further optimization. Review of the results of a recent study (Irie et al, 2002) suggests that recording PKC delta expression at 48-72 h instead of 24 h and modifying our protocol by using a different siRNA might lead to more efficient and consistent inhibition of PKC delta.

EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF ALPHA B-CRYSTALLIN IN HUMAN MALIGNANT GLIOMA CELL POPULATIONS.
Jud L. Kilbourn
Desert Mountain High School, Scottsdale , AZ, USA

Treatment of human malignant gliomas often includes surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation; yet, it is common for such tumors to recur. The genetic instability of primary gliomas results in a cell population that is inherently heterogeneous. It is likely that cells which survive treatment and repopulate the tumor mass are selected because of intrinsic genetic advantages over cells which have not survived treatment. In an effort to characterize the differences between cells from primary and recurrent tumors, and cells treated with chemotherapy in vitro, cDNA microarray data was collected for various tumor cell populations. Recent findings have shown that cells from both recurrent tumor tissue and cells selected in vitro for BCNU-resistance exhibit particularly high expression of the gene Alpha B-Crystallin (CRYAB). This gene, located on chromosome 11, codes for a heat shock molecular chaperone which has been shown to be overexpressed in several neurological disorders. The expression level of CRYAB in primary, recurrent, and BCNU-resistant cell lines has been analyzed. Specifically, the overexpression observed using cDNA microarrays has been confirmed and quantified using RT-PCR. Cells from recurrent tumors selected for drug resistance in vitro have shown an expression level up to 375 times higher than that of the primary tumor cells. In an effort to characterize this gene expression either as constitutive or induced as a result of drug treatment, RNA has also been isolated for RT-PCR from these cell lines at assorted time points following their exposure to chemotherapy. Analysis of these samples is in progress.

A STUDY OF PROTEOGLYCANS: POTENTIAL BIOMARKER FOR CONGENITAL HYDROCEPHALUS IN THE H-TX MODEL - PHASE II
Peter M. Williams, Elysia M. Segal
Lake Highland Preparatory School; Orlando, FL, U.S.A. 

Hydrocephalus, a neurological disorder caused by abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain’s ventricles, often goes unnoticed and causes injury due to inadequate detection methods. This experiment investigated how proteoglycans, proteins which signal for tissue development, correlate with the onset of hydrocephalus on both the genetic and protein levels. <br><br>RT-PCR measured mRNA expressions of proteoglycans Syndecan-1, Syndecan-3, and NG2 on the genetic level. Three series of Sprague Dawley (SD) Control and Hydrocephalus-Texas (H-Tx) Experimental Models for embryological days E-16, E-17, and E-18 were run in triplicate; totaling 9 complete sample sets (SD E-16, E-17, E-18 and H-Tx E-16, E-17, E-18) for each proteoglycan. This process reported greater mRNA expression of the Syndecan-3 and NG2 proteoglycans in the SD Model samples, hypothetically signifying more protein production, as analyzed through Scion-Imaging© software.<br><br> On the protein level, proteoglycans were investigated through Critical Electrolyte Concentration Method (CEC) quantification and the ELISA Technique. Scion-Imaging© provided integrated density readings of prior CEC results, displaying more abundant proteoglycan families in the SD Model than in the H-Tx and HC Models. In addition, ELISAs were performed using amniotic fluid to identify the abundance of Syndecan-1, Syndecan-3, and NG2. The resulting optical density readings not only supported the hypothesis that more proteoglycans would be found within the SD Model than the H-Tx Model for Syndecan-3, but also verified the effectiveness of testing via amniocenteses rather than using homogenized brain tissue.<br><br> This knowledge enables researchers to screen for hydrocephalus at an embryological stage, allowing the disorder to be caught early to prevent damage to the fetus. Furthermore, it may also provide researchers with the information necessary to develop a treatment and/or a cure for hydrocephalus.<br><br>

"WHAT'S ALL THE BUZZ ABOUT?"
Shawane Marie Fletcher, Brittany Rochea' Cochran
St. James High School, St. James Louisiana, USA

We are conducting a clinical research on the effects of local honey on seasonal allergy problems. It has been inferred that if a person who has seasonal allergies (pollen-related) takes local honey he or she will be relieved of some discomfort of these symptoms. The project requires human subjects with seasonal allergies, non-seasonal allergies (dust-related), and no known allergies at all. Some subjects will be asked to take local honey, non-local honey (store bought), or no honey at all in order to compare the results of the effects of the honey regimen. This project is perfectly safe. It involves no blood testing of any kind, surgeries, etc. All that is required is that participants take two teaspoonfuls of honey daily (provided by researchers)for those selected, keep a daily record (simple checklist provided by researchers), and complete a questionnaire (provided by researchers) to determine placement and acceptability of subject. The only concerns are for those participants who may have diabetes, which was to be determine from the questionnaire. Upon analyzing the results of the fall session of testing, a correlation between honey (all kinds) consumption and allergy symptoms relief appears to exist.

AGONIST EFFECT ON BREAST CELL GROWTH AND INVASION
Emily Erin Stoll, Camille S.M. Erickson
Perham High School, 200 5th St. SE Perham, Minnesota 56573 United States

The sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE) is a membrane protein that transports sodium into and hydrogen out of the cell. When NHE is inhibited, the ability of the cells to migrate is decreased. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether agonists that activate NHE can induce a change in cell morphology and increase tumor formation. Our hypothesis is that the agonists will induce the normal cell to behave like a tumor cell. <br><br> Our current study focuses on the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). uPA stimulates cell migration in several cancerous cells. Both normal breast cells and tumor breast cells were used in this study. The effect of initial cell density was found to significantly alter the viability and final density of the cells. The tumorgenicity of the cell was measured by observing both the morphology and the number of cells which migrated into a gel matrix after agonist stimulation. We found a significant increase in tumors forming in the tumor cell line over normal breast cell line. We also found that uPA caused the normal breast cells to migrate to a level similar to the tumor cell line.<br><br> This investigation showed that uPA caused morphological changes in cell cultures, which may be an indication of a more aggressive growth pattern. In addition, uPA converts normal breast cells to grow and invade similar to the tumor cell line. The conclusions drawn from this project could be helpful in determining ways to block hormones that activate NHE, slowing tumor formation and invasion.<br><br><br><br>

REDUCTION OF MIGRAINE PAIN THROUGH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY IN PINE BARK EXTRACT
Cindy Kay Chambers, Shalyn Smith
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY USA

Pycnogenol, (Pinus maritima)can help to prevent inflammation. Indigenous people used other species in the Pinus genus to treat ailments and illnesses. Migraines are caused by inflammation in the cranium. Inflammation in the cranium encases the brain, resulting in a migraine.<br><br> The purpose of this research was to observe the effects and reactions that Pycnogenol has on the contributors involved in the inflammatory response, then to take these results and apply them as a prophylaxis against the inflammatory process associated with migraines.<br><br> Cells were cultured, and Pycnogenol solutions were added. Primary antibodies were then added, providing bond sites for the secondary antibodies. DAB stain was used to show where the antibodies bonded to the NK-1R. Higher levels of NK-1R activity verified that introduced antibodies were bonding to the NK-1R, and conversely that NK-1 was not.<br><br> The control showed an average of 18.5 NK-1 receptors being bonded to the antibody. Twenty microliters of Pycnogenol showed average expressions of 29.25. An average of 157.75 expressions were found with the addition of forty microliters of Pycnogenol. When sixty microliters of Pycnogenol were used, the average number of NK-1 receptor expressions was 179.25. Eighty microliters produced an average of 290.67 expressions. The addition of one hundred microliters of Pycnogenol reduced NK-1 receptor expressions.<br><br> Eighty microliters of Pycnogenol proved to be the most effective concentration for reducing the attachment of NK-1 to NK-1R. This provides strong evidence that addition of this concentration of Pycnogenol should lead to reductions in the inflammatory activity associated with migraines.

DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR CALCIUM AS A DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AGONIST IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION
Brandy Lynne Wilkinson, Emily Ann Johnson
Greybull High School, Greybull WY, USA

Depression is a mental state of a depressed mood. Depression can occur on many levels ranging from normal feelings of the blues through dysthymia to major depression.<br><br> There are three molecules, known as monoamines, in the brain that help regulate moods: norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Dopamine is associated with the incentive we get that keeps us participating in an activity. There is evidence that is also a factor in deprssion.<br><br> There has been significant increase in the amount of people taking anti-depressant drugs. Along with this came great concerns about drug dependency and serious side effects. Because of this, doctors have begun looking to natural substances as alternative treatments.<br><br> Studies have found that most people with severe depression have low levels of vitamins B and C. Other studies show that depression can be a direct result of insufficient essential fatty acids and low levels of calcium, magnesium, cooper, iron, and potassium.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to study the effect Coral Calcium has on the activity of dopamine, a significant factor in depression.<br><br> After reviewing the results of the experiment, the first series of tests showed what we had expected to see. The dopamine levels increased as the calcium concentration was increased. This supports the belief that calcium can aid in the treatment of depression.<br><br>

ARTHRITIC GENE THERAPY IN CHONDROCYTES AND SYNOVIOCYTES
Ciara Ann Barr, Amanda Russo
Fox Lane High School, Bedford New York, USA

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein resulting in Nitric Oxide (NO) synthesis. NO leads to cartilage degradation and joint inflammation, as seen in arthritis. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) inhibits the effects of IL-1. The adenovirus (Ad) is a commonly used, highly efficient vehicle for gene therapy. Yet, Ad is non-integrating and is shown to be pathogenic. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) however has no pathogenic effect. By site-specifically integrating itself, AAV vectors offer long-term expression of the genes they encode. It was hypothesized that once IRAP was transduced by AAV or Ad vectors, IRAP would be expressed, hence inhibiting NO synthesis. The effects of gene therapy in transfer of IRAP into chondrocytes and synoviocytes using Ad or AAV-mediated gene therapy were compared. It was concluded that Ad is a more efficient vector on the short term, however AAV is more successful on the long term. It was also found that chondrocytes are more effective in IRAP production than synoviocytes. This is an important step in developing a novel approach to arthritic gene therapy. In fact, 1 in 6 Americans suffers from arthritis. Gene therapy such as that dealt with in this experiment could greatly benefit the population.<br><br>

HUMAN SPECTRIN USED TO CORRECT SPHEROCYTIC HEMOLYTIC MOUSE ERYTHROCYTE GHOSTS
Natalie Victoria Wessel, Michael David Wain
Oakton High School, Vienna Virginia, United States

The purpose was to examine the effects of human spectrin introduction to mutant mouse ghosts affected by spherocytosis. The mutant red blood cells we worked with had no alpha spectrin and only trace amounts of beta spectrin. The goal of experimentation was to determine whether binding of human spectrin would account for the overall deficiency of the protein in the cell membrane. Through supervised experimentation, our team was able to use gel electrophoresis to assess the success of the reconstitution.<br><br> We made ghost cells from normal mouse blood and mutant mouse blood by centrifuging and hemolyzing the cells with lysing buffers. Spectrin was purified from regular mouse blood and human spectrin was purchased. Human and mouse spectrin were heat-denatured to use as negative controls. The spectrophotometer measured the amounts of spectrin prior to the reconstitution. Spectrin was added to the ghosts and the open membrane was sealed by the addition of isotonic KCl. To allow binding of spectrin to the interior membrane surface, temperature was raised to 37 degrees Celsius. Aliquots were taken of all types of spectrin for the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was suspended in silver dye buffer. Flow cytometry was used to validate the concentrations of spectrin in the ghosts.<br><br> After the developing stage of the silver staining process we were able to see the protein bands appear in the polyacrylamide gel. The human alpha spectrin band did appear in the lane with the human-spectrin reconstituted ghosts. This showed that human spectrin can successfully bind to spherocytic mouse ghosts. Since the mutant ghosts had only traces of beta spectrin to begin with, the reconstitution allowed visibility of both alpha and beta spectrin in the gel. Reconstitution was successful as alpha spectrin was visible in the mutants and our flow cytometry data show there was not alpha spectrin in the original mutant cells.

The purpose of this research is to calculate the presence of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) in foods and the production of a MSG indicator. MSG can cause health damages, such as Parkinson’s disease, and Fybromialgia Syndrome (FS). Internet-published cases of people attributing their health problems to MSG intake were studied. A FS patient and a natural medicine doctor were interviewed. To calculate MSG amounts in food, supermarket products were purchased. It was observed that the nutrition information on the food labels doesn’t always name MSG; it was disguised with other preservative names. The amount of MSG in these foods was calculated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. MSG in these foods ranged from 0.5% to trace amounts. For the MSG indicator, B. Olerasea (purple cabbage, a pH indicator) was boiled in water. A teaspoon of MSG was added to the resulting dark purple liquid. The liquid turned blue, which suggested a high concentration of MSG. When foods were added to the extract of B. Olerasea, a variety of lavender shades were produced. These shades may be due to a low MSG concentration. B. Olerasea may not be specific, because it can detect other food ingredients, not necessarily MSG. Therefore, the synthesis of an MSG indicator is in process. It is concluded that: 1.As a result of twenty-seven products that were exam only twelve had MSG.2. the extract of B. Olerasea could be an ingredient of a MSG indicator.3. according to the literature ,MSG causes damages to our health.<br><br><br>

Karla Michelle Rivera, Rafael Santini
De La Salle College Box 518 Bayamón, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this research was to study the antibacterial and anticoagulant properties of garlic extracts, Allium sativum L. in comparison to commercial antibiotics againts common enteric bacteria as Salmonella thipy, Shigella dysenterica, and Escherichia coli as well commercial anticoagulants. Garlic extracts were prepared using blended garlic at different concentrations and distilled water as solvent. The antibacterial test show that with 10 drops of garlic permit only a 5% growth of S. thipy, 3% growth for S. dysenterica, and 1% growth the E. coli. The percent of bacterial growth compared with the commercial antibiotic was 0 in all the bacteria cultures.The coagulation time of blood with garlic extract (1 to 10 drops) was from 1.2 to 5.1 seconds when compared with the control groups (blood with sodium citrate 3.2%) vs the 25 seconds of difference that had the commercial anticoagulant with its control group. It can be concluded that garlic may be used as a natural antibiotic and as an anticoagulant when there is no presence of a severe infection or condition caused by these bacteria’s or blood coagulation problem or need.

Jose Mercado, Sebastian Mundaca
Eagle School, Antofagasta, Second Region, CHILE

This project in its present form is the final result of a long experimental chemical process and the effects of high ultraviolet resistance on a particular vegetable found in the high plateau of the Andean Mountain Range, called,"Chachacoma" (Senecio eriophyton remy). The initial idea was to determine its chemical compounds and its capacity of sun radiation absorbance.<br><br>After a long experimental development, using solvent extraction technics in the chemistry laboratory , two substances are at last obtained, they are SG I and SG IV.<br><br>Through mass espectroscopy, infrared technics and nuclear magnetic resonance, the molecular structure C13H1403 is determined, which corresponds to the identified substance SG I.<br><br>It is concluded that the contribution of this project is the great and effective capacity of absorbance of UVB that the isolated compounds of the vegetable "Chachacoma" have. This result benefits directly the Southern part of South America which is highly exposed to a noxious daily sun radiation, this because the Northern part of our country, Chile, has a great number of sunny days along the year,causing serious dermical problems that go from an eritema to the well known melanoma or celular base. Besides, it is known by everybody that through scientifical studies it has been proved that the ozone layer is seriously damaged in this area.<br><br>The Chachacoma compounds may contribute to help the potential and real danger produced by the sun.

BY WHAT MECHANISM DO SARCOMERES ADAPT DURING DISTRACTION?
January Mykaelyn Brandon, Connie Kim
North Garland High School, Garland, TX, United States

This study is clinically relevant in that some children are born with abnormally short extremities and require limb lengthening to acquire their ordinary functions. To lengthen a limb, a patient must undergo a process of distraction. When a limb is distracted, an osteotomy is performed (the bone is bisected) and the fragments are gradually moved apart incrementally over a period of time. As time progresses, osteogenesis occurs: new cells, osteoblasts, form between the two parts of bone. As the bone is lengthened, the surrounding tissues, i.e. muscle, adaptively change with their environment. Once this process is complete, the limbs are functional and anatomically proportionate. The purpose of this research is to examine the ultrastructural changes that occur within muscle tissue during limb lengthening; this research determines by which mechanism myofibrils lengthen.<br><br> The examination of specimens is conducted in two parts. Part I determines the average length of sarcomeres of normal muscle and is divided into two experiments: Experiment I measures hypercontracted sarcomeres and Experiment II measures normal sarcomeres. Part II compares the ultrastructural differences between normal and distracted sarcomeres. All sarcomere measurements are calculated using the Soft Imaging Analysis software along with the electron microscope.<br><br> After completion of Part II of this project, measurements indicate that myofibrils of the muscle cells lengthen as a result of the addition of sarcomeres. The size of distracted sarcomeres was found to be 0.6 microns smaller than normal sarcomeres suggesting the addition of new sarcomeres in myofibrils rather than the stretching of the original sarcomeres. <br><br>

FABULOUS FIBER
Brianna Anne Chapman, Carly Travis Bates
Port Huron High School, Port Huron, MI, USA

Our science project researched where high school students consumed the highest amount of dietary fiber during their lunch: from student prepared, parent prepared, or school prepared lunches. <br><br> We interviewed seventy-five students at our high school and recorded everything they ate for their lunch, how much was eaten, and who prepared it, over a five day period. We inserted the results of what each student had eaten into a fiber calculator found on the internet, directed to us by a professor, from a state university. The results obtained from the fiber calculator told us how much fiber was eaten by each subject during each lunch. <br><br> We discovered that our hypothesis was false. We believed that parent prepared lunches would have the most fiber content, when compared to school prepared and self prepared lunches, because we thought parents would pack the healthiest foods in their child’s lunch. <br><br> Upon observing the data, we discovered that the school prepared lunches contained the most fiber content, while the parent prepared lunches had the second highest fiber content, and the student prepared lunches had the least amount of fiber. We discovered that all of the school lunches that were eaten by the students were the result of ala’carte selections. So the students were not preparing their lunches, but were in effect choosing their food items.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF PKU IN THE ITALIAN POPULATION: IDENTIFICATION OF R408W MUTATION IN THE PHENYLALANINE HYDROXYLASE GENE EXON 12
Daniele Vilella, Marco De Candia, Giulio Penetta
Liceo Classico Statale “Socrate” – Via S. Tommaso d’Aquino, 4 - 70124 Bari - ITA

This project is aimed to contribute to the complete characterization of the molecular basis off phenylketonuria(PKU) in Italy. To this aim the mutation analysis of phenylalaninehydroxylase (PAH) gene exon 12 has been performed in 65 uncharacterised Italian PKU chromosomes out of 289. In order to carry out PAH gene molecular characterization, a combined approach has been used including single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequence analysis, and MnlI restriction site analysis of exon 12. SSCP analysis allows the mutation scanning of a target gene sequence through polyacrylamide/glycerol gel electrophoresis analysis of a denatured PCR product. SSCP analysis, first applied to 9 DNA samples corresponding to 12 PKU uncharacterised chromosomes, allowed to identify a chromosome carrying R408W PAH mutation. The remaining 53 chromosomes were screened for the presence of R408W through analysis of exon 12 MnlI site which is abolished in the presence of R408W mutation. R408W mutation has been identified in three Italian PKU chromosomes with a relative frequency of 1.0 %, thus confirming the high degree of genotype heterogeneity of PAH gene in Italian PKU patients. This result contributes to the characterization of the molecular basis of PKU in the Italian population, allowing genotype-phenotype correlation studies as well as the development of new molecular diagnostic tools for an early assessment of clinical phenotype in PKU newborns in order to implement the best diet therapy.

DOES MUSIC CAUSE ANY VARIATIONS IN VITAL SIGNS?
Parker Nicholas Courtley , Michael Alan Tabor
Mountain View Jr. High , Sumner , Washington , U.S.A

The purpose of our experiment was to find a way to increase body temerature with music rather than by turning up the heat or by exercising to increase one's pulse rate. The general procedure was to find a controlled environment, take the temperature and resting pulse of the subjects before they had listened to different types of music. After they listened to classical rock for ten minutes, we recorded the change of pulse and body temperature. Next we did the same thing again with metal and heavy metal music. We the repeated this procedure untill we had tested 30 people. Our hypothesis was that if the music was intense, it would cause more change to the body's vital signs, and if the music was at a constant, slow rate, the body's signs would either stay the same or be lower. We found that our hypothesis was right because we stated that more intense music would create more change, and less intense music would not and may even lower vital signs. Our results showed our hypothesis was true.<br><br>

EFFECT OF MIGRANT COMPOUNDS OF VARIOUS PLASTICS ON THE VITALITY OF DAPHNIA MAGNA
Amanda Mychal Nagy, Darcy Renee Diegel
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, Montana, United States of America

This study was conducted to determine the toxicity and migration levels of selected plastics when heated in an oil-based solution. Vinyl, styrene, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate were the four types of plastics tested. Plastics were cut into small pieces and were then added to a mixture of 10 mL of safflower oil and .05 mL of Tween 80 before being placed in an oven at 205°F for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes, respectively. After cooling, 2 mL of the heated oil/plastic mixture were then added to 200 mL of spring water. 5 daphnia magna and a pinch of daphnia food were added to each beaker and were labeled. Daphnia mortality rates, heart rates, reproduction, and activity were then observed, recorded, and analyzed to determine the effect of the different plastics for a period of seven days. Trials were repeated three times. Statistical significance was then determined using T-tests. Further data analysis was accomplished by running the data through a statistical analysis program on a computer. Results from these tests illustrated that the plastics had a significantly negative effect on the daphnia when compared to the control. Furthermore, the selected plastics appeared to have significant effects when compared to each other. From these results we can conclude that vinyl, styrene, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate have significantly negative effects on daphnia magna and possibly on other organisms.

ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION AS A MEANS OF ERADICATING LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES AND SALMONELLA CHOLERAESUIS: COMMON FOOD BORNE BACTERIA
Jesse Donald Ranney, Kathryn Breaux
Catholic High of New Iberia, New Iberia, Louisiana, United States

In America, over 76 million people contract some type of food borne illness each year and of those more than 300,000 people are hospitalized and 10,000 are killed. Several bacteria, including Listeria and Salmonella, are becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Therefore, prevention of these bacteria is becoming more important each year.<br><br> The purpose of this research is to determine if ultraviolet radiation can be used to eradicate food borne bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella choleraesuis, regardless of temperature. To determine whether UV is effective, 60 plates were inoculated. Six plates of each bacteria were exposed to 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of UV radiation at 302 nm. Three out of each set of six were wrapped in an opaque covering prior to treatment. After treatment the bacteria were lifted off the plates using tryptic soy broth and diluted before being re-plated. Plates were incubated for 48 hours. The Colony Forming Units were then counted and recorded. These steps were performed at 14 and 25 oC for each bacteria, representing refrigerated and room temperatures. Subsequent experiments were performed at intervals of five minutes to determine the optimum time of exposure.<br><br> After treatment of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, it was apparent that both Listeria and Salmonella were adversely effected with a mean percent death rate of 99.1, 99.0, 99.9, and 99.9%, respectively. Additionally, at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, both bacteria were virtually eradicated with a mean percent death rate of 97.4, 98.4, 97.8, and 98.8%, respectively. This data was supported by a t-test, a p-value less than 0.01.<br><br> Because of these results, a wide variety of applications can be instituted. The effectiveness at the lower temperature might lead to a UV light in refrigerators. Because the higher temperature is most like room temperature, UV radiation could be used in an appliance similar to a microwave box to sterilize food.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF P27 IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED CANCER CELL DEATH
Joanne June Lee, Rupa Lalchandani
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, California, U.S.A.

Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., cell lines were treated with Docetaxel, an anti-microtubule agent that causes M-phase arrest. Previous experimentation with Docetaxel treated cells yielded cells with high levels of p27, a tumor suppressor protein, in those cells arrested in M-phase. This occurrence was extremely unexpected and aberrant, since p27 is generally found exclusively during G1-phase in normal cells. We investigated the possible roles of p27 in Docetaxel treated cells, believing p27 to have a second phosphorylation site that, when activated during M-phase, aided cell apoptosis. Research goals included documenting the aberrant p27 concentrations in treated cells as well as testing various proteins that could be phosphorylating or stabilizing a protein complex with p27 to cause cell apoptosis. Suspects included various cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (cdk’s) normally found in M-phase cells, such as Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, and/or Cdk1. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting procedures were used to measure the related protein levels in treated cells. Cyclin B1 and Cdk1 were found to be most probably linked in protein complexes with p27. Further experimentation, however, is required to conclusively confirm these results.

EFFECTS OF EXAM STRESS ON STUDENT CORTISOL LEVELS
Rhea Edelman, Erin Frantz
West Linn High School West Linn, OR U.S.

This project measured real time student cortisol responses to perceived stress of an Honors English final examination. Our hypothesis was that exam stress would trigger stress hormone responses involving the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), and that significant increases in the major glucocorticoid stress hormone, cortisol would be observable. We also hypothesized that female Honor students perceive greater exam stress and would show a greater increase in cortisol levels. <br><br>Eleven Honor students volunteered (six females, five males) to provide saliva samples five minutes before and 20 minutes into the final exam. We established a sample collection protocol and collected samples using salivettes. <br><br>We analyzed the samples using a high sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immuno assay kit and optical plate reader with a 450nm filter. <br><br>Sample results showed a significant mean increase for the entire group of 3.01 nmol/liter. The mean increase for the females in our group, however, was not statistically significant, while the mean increase for males was highly significant. <br><br>Individual variations in cortisol increases indicate possible high and low responders in both genders. <br><br>A larger sample group and more frequent sampling during and after the exam would have been desirable to more fully assess cortisol response to academic stress which can contribute over time to allostatic load.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE VIABILITY OF ENTEROCOCCUS AUREUS, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ON LATEX GLOVES, TOURNIQUETS, AND STETHOSCOPES: A SOURCE FOR NOSOCOMI
Louis Paul Derousie
Orange Park High School, Orange Park, Fl, U.S.A.

Nosocomial infections are responsible for 20,000 deaths in the United States per year. Approximately 10% of hospitalized patients (2 million per year) acquire a clinically significant nosocomial infection. As early as the 70’s there was a growing concern regarding the increasing rates of nosocomial infections. Today nosocomial infections are a national concern due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the appearance of resistance in the community. The major organisms responsible for hospital acquired infections are Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas. Colonized and infected patients can harbor resistant, pathogenic organisms. The purpose of this study is to determine the viability of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on sterile latex gloves, tourniquets, and stethoscopes. <br><br>Latex gloves, tourniquets, and stethoscopes, inoculated with E. faecalis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, were cultured at timed intervals of 15 minutes, 45 minutes, and 70 minutes. After 70 minutes, 100% of the gloves and tourniquets were culture positive. The stethoscopes were culture positive 35% E. faecalis, 100% S. aureus, and 15% P. aeruginosa at 70 minutes.<br><br>This study supports the hypothesis of the viability of pathogenic organisms on environmental surfaces. In examining the probability of these environmental surfaces as a factor in the transmission of organisms from patient-to-patient, recommendations can be made for reduction of nosocomial infections: 1. frequent glove change, 2. disposable tourniquets for individual use only, 3. stethoscopes cleaned in between patient use. <br><br>

CAN INTERFERING RNA'S BE USED TO "SILENCE" GENES ENCODING TELOMERASE?
Tara Elise Barrett
Lincoln Park Academy Fort Pierce, FL United States

The purpose of this experiment was to see if the researcher could design an interfering RNA (RNAi) that could hamper the ability of telomerase to lengthen chromosomes during DNA replication as well as reduce the amount of cell growth in Myeloma cells.<br><br> The procedure of this experiment entailed several processes, the first of them being transfection. With the transfection process the researcher was able to introduce two types of RNAi in to the different cell treatments. RNAi 1 was complementary to the mRNA of the telomerase, while RNAi 2 was not. Thus, RNAi 2 should have had no effect on the production of telomerase. During this process the four treatments that would be used throughout the duration of the project were developed. Treatment 1 included RNAi 1, transfection media, and Myeloma cells; Treatment 2 included RNAi 2, transfection media, and Myeloma cells; Treatment 3 included transfection media and Myeloma cells; and Treatment 4 included only cells. For four days cell growth was counted for each treatment using a hemacytometer and a microscope. The data was recorded. After the four days the ELISA test was conducted in order to see the prevalence of telomerase in each of the four treatment.<br><br> As hypothesized, Treatment 1 had the lowest amount of cell growth, as well as the lowest amount of telomerase production. This conclusion signifies that the RNAi 1 was able to decrease telomerase production and cell growth. This is significant because telomerase is an essential part of cancer cells, thus, with further experimentation RNAi could possibly be used as a tool in cancer therapy.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF ACID CONTENT IN SODAS AND THE EFFECT ON HUMAN TEETH
Jonathan William Parramore
Union Grove High School McDonough, Georgia, USA

In recent decades the consumption of soda products has dramatically increased. The amount of calcium depleting acids, such as phosphoric and citric, taken in by the public has mulitplied. Calcium depletion contributes to the increase of tooth decay and bone loss.<br><br> This is a continuation of a previous project. In this phase, the molarity of acid in each soda type was determined by a titration against a standard solution of NaOH. From the titration data, solutions of acids were produced to have the identical acid molarity of the soda products. Three acid solutions were produced: phosphoric, citric, and a combination of phosphoric and citric. The controls were water and air. Unerupted molar human teeth were divided into five experimental groups representing each of the acid solutions and air. The roots of the teeth were blocked off with epoxy to prevent loss of mass from the root area. The solution with the combination of phosphoric and citric acids had the highest loss of mass in the trials. Second was phosphoric, then citric. Water lost mass but not significant to the acid solutions. Teeth exposed to the air had no decrease in mass. Continuing trials are being conducted to produce more accurate statistical analysis from the data.<br><br> If the acids commonoly found in soda products does increase the risk of calcium loss in bones and teeth, then children and young women would need to know the consequences of consuming large amounts of soda products.

TRACKING THE PLAQUE: UNDERSTANDING RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE ATHEROSCLEROSIS
P. Justin Rossi
Home School, Pasco County, Florida, USA

Rapidly progressive atherosclerosis (RPA) is characterized by the development of a significant (>70%) stenosis (narrowing) of a major coronary vessel within a one-year time period. Serious consequences, such as an acute cardiac event, have been linked to this condition; despite this, RPA has rarely been studied. The purpose of this study is to systematically investigate rapidly progressive atherosclerosis in order to pinpoint its causes and, hence, better treatments.<br><br> In order to study RPA, the Cardioquest Interventional Database was queried for patients having at least two cardiac catheterizations during a one-year time period in the years 2001-2003. The query yielded an experimental group of progressors and a control group of non-progressors. Demographic, laboratory, and angiographic data were obtained for both groups. Statistical analyses using NCSS software and angiographic analyses were performed on this data.<br><br> The results of this analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus, consistently high triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia), and younger age (40’s and 50’s) were the major risk factors for RPA. Angiographic analysis revealed that there are several equally viable angiographic risk factors for RPA, which include prior intervention in a portion of a coronary artery leading to subsequent progression and observed vulnerable plaque leading to subsequent “plaque rupture.”<br><br> The study also showed that many patients possessed multiple observed risk factors for RPA, usually a combination of angiographic, demographic (age), and chemical risk factors. Based on these findings, it was recommended that physicians pursue a more aggressive treatment plan in regards to these newly identified risk factors.<br><br>

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FOLIC ACID, HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE; A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Tristan Emil Gonzalez-Sanz
Dunbar High School, Fort Myers, Florida, United States

The purpose for this experiment is to document the interaction of folic acid with homocysteine levels. The levels of homocysteine in the body can be measured by the blood pressure of the test animal. There is a correlation between elevated homocysteine levels and hypertension. Additionally, lower homocysteine levels lead to lower blood pressure.<br><br>The experiment consisted of three test samples. The samples consisted of sixteen female white mice. Each sample was given a varying degree of folic acid. The first test group (Sample A) received 300% of the recommended daily dosage. The second group (Sample B) was given 150% of the recommended daily dosage. The third group (Sample C) received no folic acid. <br><br>Note: The daily dosage was calculated by comparing the body masses of the average human and the average mouse with the daily recommended dosage of folic acid for humans. The increase was made because mice have a higher metabolism, and would therefore pass the folic acid through their body at a faster rate. Additionally, the results would be easier to observe in larger amounts. <br><br>Please see Procedure page for further information. <br><br>The systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure of every mouse was recorded daily for a period of three months. From the recordings it is apparent that there is a 3.7% decrease of systolic pressure in Sample A and a 3.08% decrease in diastolic pressure in Sample B. Sample A had a 3.08% decrease in diastolic pressure and Sample B had a 1.83% decrease. These results show a correlation between folic acid, homocysteine levels, and blood pressure.<br><br>

EVALUATING THE EXPRESSION OF AEBP1 IN HUMAN OSTEOBLASTS
Kevin E. Vorhis
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL USA

The previous year’s experiment indicated that AEBP1 message expression can increase when human fetal osteoblast cells (hFOB) are induced to differentiate. This was based upon preliminary data employing Cbfa1, ODC, and AEBP1 primers. This experiment sought to explore and expand that hypothesis of an increase in AEBP1 expression as hFOB cells differentiate, by verifying the osteoblast phenotype using Osterix, Osteocalcin, and Osteonectin primers, and employing antisense technology (RNAi- “RNA interference”) to block the production of AEBP1 RNA prior to osteoblast phenotype characterization. This would also be conducive to western blot analysis using AEBP1 antibodies.<br><br>Two separate in vitro models were explored: osteoblast differentiation mediated by temperature, and cell differentiation by cytokine treatment (TNF-a, and TGF-b). RNA was extracted from cells in both models. Message levels were quantified using RT-PCR for AEBP1 and all investigated markers for the osteoblast phenotype. Results showed increase in AEBP1 mRNA expression in response to temperature. Investigated markers likewise increased. In cytokine models, TNF-a samples exhibited the greatest increase in AEBP1 and osteoblast specifc marker levels. Preliminary investigation of RNAi and western blot analysis is promising and further investigation is warranted.<br><br>

GOSSYPIUM HIRSUTUM: COTTONSEED'S CANCER FIGHTER
Margaret Elisa McQueen
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, Florida, United States of America

<br><br> One of every eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. The current cancer treatments available are exceedingly toxic to the body. An effective, less toxic, organic treatment to control cancerous growth is sought and studied.<br><br> An organic and abundant substance derived from cottonseeds, Gossypium hirsutum or gossypol, was used to treat estrogen receptive, MCF-7 breast cancer cells in this study. The gossypol, dissolved into solution with DMSO, was diluted to obtain these dosages: 2.5mM, 10.0mM, 50.0mM and 100.0mM. After plating cancer cells onto two 96-well plates, the gossypol was added. After a 24-hour incubation period, an MTS Assay was run. After 48 hours the second plate was assayed. The MTS Assay measures absorbency, which is directly related to the amount of viable cells.<br><br> 24-hour assay results were inconclusive regarding gossypol’s effect on cancerous growth. The average absorbency for the two sets of untreated control cells was 1.473 AU (1.0-2.0 scale); the average absorbency for 2.5mM was 1.47 AU, for 10.0mM- 1.5475 AU, for 50.0mM-1.5835 AU and for 100.0mM-1.515 AU. The 48-hour assay exhibited growth inhibition after treatment. The average absorbency for the two sets of untreated control cells was 1.1745 AU (1.0-2.0 scale) and the average absorbency for 2.5mM was 1.308 AU, for 10.0mM-1.1562 AU, for 50.0mM-1.1018 AU and for 100.0mM-1.0063 AU.<br><br> In vitro, assay results exhibit an amplified degree of apoptosis in gossypol treated cells after a 48-hour window. This experiment suggests that Gossypium hirsutum may have therapeutic potential in estrogen receptive breast cancer.<br><br><br>

THE HOLY GRAIL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING: RAPID ANGIOGENESIS FOR EFFECTIVE ORGAN PERFUSION
Shiv Mukesh Gaglani
West Shore High School, Melbourne, FL, USA

Currently, over 82,000 people are on the National Organ Transplantation Waiting List. Eighteen will die today. Tissue engineering, growing body tissue for transplantation, is a potential solution to this crisis. Organ printing is an extremely promising method that uses rapid prototyping (RP) technology, which is constructing three-dimensional tissue layer-by-layer. The purpose of this study was to rapidly "print" a branching tube composed of smooth muscle cells (essentially a blood vessel), so that future printed organs may be perfused swiftly, ensuring viability. <br><br>An HP 500 inkjet printer was modified to print "bioink" composed of smooth muscle and endothelial cells (ATCC) in calcium chloride solution. Layered designs of branching tubes were generated in Microsoft Paint and transferred onto Word for printing. Printed cell layers were held in place by gelling between alginate, placed on the printing platform, and calcium chloride. After each layer was printed, the modified platform was lowered 100 micrometers and subsequent layers were printed. The final layered structure was incubated for 2-3 weeks to allow the cells to proliferate, strengthen cell bonding, and enable the gel to biodegrade, leaving only a branching tube of fused living cells. <br><br>After incubation, the cells reached a density of 1.4x10^7 cells/ml with 80% viability. The average values of the elastic modulus of the tube was found to be 4.54 kPa. The tube's lumen remained intact. Further work includes replacing the color cartridge will cells (i.e. hepatocytes) and printing the blood vessel in a cube of tissue, paving the way for complex organ production.

Holmium lasers are used to treat kidney stones through flexible endoscopes called ureteroscopes. Fiber optic wave guides (laser fibers) deliver the light from the laser to the kidney stones. There are many reports of damage to ureteroscopes by the failure of the fibers to contain the laser energy. My hypothesis is that the cause of the fiber failure relates to the bend diameter, power input, and type of fiber. <br><br> I tested a number of fibers in a clinically relevant series of different bend diameters and energy settings. The fibers differed in their core sizes, numeric aperture (NA), and launch configuration. All were tested to the point of fiber failure evidenced by visible damage to the fiber. The results clearly showed the most important variable to be the type of fiber. The reduced cladding launch with a 272-micron fiber proved to be tolerant of tighter bends and higher energies. Fibers with a higher NA also tolerated tighter bends and higher energies. The bend diameter was critical for all fibers, but at different diameters. Higher power settings were associated with increased rate of fiber failure, but to a lesser degree.<br><br> I concluded that the optimum fiber should have a high NA, reduced cladding at the launch, and a core of approximately 272 microns. This has immediate application in clinical practice, as intra-operative ureteroscope failures are common and, based on my observations, avoidable. This information can improve operative safety, patient outcomes, and save enormous costs in repair and replacement of ureteroscopes.<br><br>

THE LONGEVITY OF THE LATENT FINGERPRINT IN CHILDREN VS. ADULTS
Kelvin Bernard Williams
Frederick Douglass High School

The purpose of this project was to determine if there was a difference in the longevity of the latent fingerprint in children versus adults. It is generally believed that a subject's age does not affect the evaporation rates of fingeprints. However, based on recent criminal investigations of child abduction, it was hypothesized that children latent fingerprints do not last as long as those of adults. Participation in this experiment was voluntary. A total of 97 subjects pressed their fingers on glass slides and their latent fingerprints were lifted one, three, five, and seven days later. A comparison was then made between the longevity of the latent fingeprints in children versus adults. Almost all of the adult prints were still present on day seven. Of the children prints, 20 percent were unclear on day three; 54 percent were unclear on day five; and 76 percent were unclear on day seven. It was concluded that the adult's fingeprints lasted longer than those of children because the volantile lipids found in children's oil secretions evaporate at a faster rate than those of adults. These findings have profound implications for law enforcement and forensic science in that time may become a critical variable in criminal invetsigations requiring the lifting of latent fingeprints of children.

EPIDEMIC OUTCOMES AS A FUNCTION OF NETWORK TOPOGRAPHY
Anna-Katrina Shedletsky
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY USA

The researcher developed an original methodology designed to provide a deeper insight into how the underlying connectivity structure of a population is related to an epidemic outcome. The research combined Milgram's idea of population connectivity with computer simulation-based epidemiology, two previously unrelated fields of study. The networks studied ranged from very structured hierarchical and scale-free networks, to unstructured random and random with superconnectors networks. Four programs were written in Visual C++: three to generate 400 sample populations of varying network types and sizes, and another to run 6,000 simulated propagation trials in each population.<br><br> The results exhibited that the underlying connectivity structure of a population is mathematically related to how an epidemic will spread in that population. The separation profiles of all networks formed normal bell curves. It was also found that in all populations with an average degree of separation greater than 10.0, the epidemic burned out on its own. Below 10.0, the epidemic outcome depended not only on the average degree of separation but also on the network structure. Hierarchical and scale-free networks could not be forced to saturation; random and superconnector structures were easily saturated. Vaccinations were distributed to prevent saturation, but these vaccinations had to obtain significant coverage in order to achieve the desired effect.<br><br> The results provided the researcher with simple strategies to combat epidemics. Although the focus of this research was on preventing the spread of contagious behavior, it can also be used to facilitate it, through the manipulation of a population's network topography.

ANALYSIS OF SUGAR SUBSTITUTES’ NEUROLOGICAL AND MUTAGENIC EFFECTS VIA THE AMES TEST AND DUGESIA TIGRINA
Kaleb Markus Naegeli
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, United States of America

The purpose was to evaluate the neurological effects of the sugar substitutes aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (with and without maltodextrin) on Dugesia tigrina and the mutagenic effects of the same sweeteners via the Ames test. Dugesia (seven/group) received 5.14 grams of sweetener/300 mL water, 0.41 grams of pure stevia/300 mL water, or 1 mg active ingredient warfarin sodium. A new Dugesia group received a sweetener concentration with the warfarin sodium to observe the interactions. The time for each group to move from the lighted side of a Petri dish to the dark half (natural habitat) was measured at 24-hour intervals up through seven days. In the Ames test, Escherichia coli WP2 strain was cultured in a nutrient broth and transferred to glucose-minimal salts agar by standard procedure. Sweetener concentration equivalent to one(1.71g/100mL) and three(5.14g/100mL) commercial carbonated beverage(s) was separately placed on sterile paper disks in six dishes/sweetener. After incubation, any colonies were mutations of original strain. Aspartame caused 2 significant results in Dugesia (with/without warfarin sodium) while stevias caused 11 significant results (plain) and 7 significant results (w/warfarin). Saccharin and sucralose had 10 and 6 significant adverse effects on times for Dugesia to move from light/dark, respectively. Aspartame caused a 91.9% significant number of mutations at one soda concentration that increased over 400% to a highly significant 6.5 back mutations/dish at 3 soda concentration (t-test=3.4>t.01=3.169). Saccharin caused 1.3 mutations/dish (t-test=6.22>t.01=3.169). Aspartame caused mutations of E. coli; stevia, sucralose, and saccharin caused significant neurological responses with the Dugesia tigrina.

THE ROLE OF ESTROGEN ON MNNG (N-METHYL-N-NITRO-N-NITROSOGUANIDINE) INDUCED PRENEOPLASTIC LESIONS IN THE MOUSE GI TRACT.
Priya Hari Iyer
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, Florida, USA

This experimentation revolves around immunohistochemistry and image analysis. Estrogen attaches to estrogen-receptors on the nuclear membrane initiating biochemical reactions in the nucleus, which influence gene expression. Researchers localize estrogen-receptors (ERs) using anti-oestrogen-receptors like ER Beta. ER Beta attaches to estrogen as a primary antibody; a secondary antibody (Mouse-On-Mouse (M.O.M) Biotinylated Anti-Mouse IgG Reagent) attaches to the primary antibody; an enzyme: ABC, attaches to the secondary antibody; a substrate/chromagen (DAB) attaches to the enzyme - the chain reaction stains ERs brown. Localizing ERs in the gastrointestinal tract leads to innovative therapies for colon cancer prevention and cure. <br><br> The second portion of this experiment revolves around image analysis. In July 2002 questions arose concerning the carcinogenic and cancer-exacerbating affects of pseudo-estrogens. Using image analysis, villi from three groups of mouse tissue were measured: normal, MNNG (N-Methyl-N-Nitro-N-Nitrosoguanidine)-induced; MNNG + Estrogen (E2)-induced. MNNG is a gastrointestinal carcinogen. Villi blunting is characteristic of cancer proliferation. In the antrum cells, the villi height fell 23% from the Normal to the MNNG induced tissue; it fell 10% from the Normal to the MNNG + E2 induced tissue. In the duodenal cells, villi height fell 43% from the Normal to MNNG induced tissue; it fell 34% from the Normal to MNNG + E2 induced tissue. In the colon tissue, villi height fell 30% from the Normal to MNNG induced; it only fell 9% in the Normal to MNNG + E2 induced tissue – biochemically proving that site-specific, targeted estrogen treatment can prevent or treat colon cancer. <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIC MERCURY (THIMEROSAL) ON CHICKEN EMBRYOS
Nicole Ann Haverland
Perham High School, Perham, Minnesota, United States

This study evaluated the effects of different doses of organic mercury (thimerosal) – which is found in many children’s vaccines – on chicken embryos. Dosages in the first experiment were based on the Oral-Rat LD50 (75 milligrams per kilogram) and included a control (saline solution), low (7.5 x 10-6 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution), moderate (7.5 x 10-5 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution), and high (7.5 x 10-2 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution). Fertilized eggs were divided into four groups of 15 eggs each and injected on day eight. Embryos were dissected on day twelve and day sixteen. This study did not show a significant difference between individual groups, but showed a significant difference between the combined group of controls and lows and the combined group of mediums and highs. Based on this data, a second experiment was conducted with dosages based thimerosal levels in vaccines including a control (0.10 mL saline solution), dosage 1 (5.38 x 10-5 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution), dosage 2 (1.52 x 10-4 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution), dosage 3 (2.02 x 10-4 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution), and dosage 4 (2.52 x 10-4 g thimerosal in 0.10 mL saline solution). Injections occurred on day 8 and dissections occurred on day 16. Embryos treated with thimerosal showed a significant increase in death rate as the level of thimerosal increased. This two-part study provides strong epidemiological evidence thimerosal poses a health risk to developing embryos.

NEURONAL CELL DEATH IN A MODEL OF HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE
Dylan Howard Young
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, USA

Huntington's Disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disease. Its cause is a mutation in the 5'-end of the gene that leads to long repeats of the amino acid gluatmine (Q) on the huntingtin (htt) protein. Others have suggested that the mutation causes oxidative stress as one mechanism that might cause cell death. To study oxidative stress, primary normal mouse neurons were transfected with marker (Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP) or normal or mutant huntingtin-expression plasmids using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Efficiency of transfection for all plasmids was high, approximately 15%. Neurons expressing GFP with or without normal htt fluoresced under a microscopic image system but otherwise appeared normal with many neurites projecting from the cell body. Neurons expressing mutant htt, however, showed statistically significant retraction of neurites (GFP: 71.5% cells with neurites 4.6+4.7 neurites/cell; GFP+htt-18Q, 83.3% 6.1+4.8; GFP+htt-148Q 37.0% 2.0+1.4; P < 0.05). Living transfected neurons were examined for the level of intracellular oxygen-free radicals using the fluorescent dye, dihydroethidium. Dihydroethidium is taken into cells as the reduced form. When oxidized by the intracellular environment it binds to the DNA and fluoresces red. Using computer aided imaging, dihydroethidium staining can be followed in individual cells containing the mutant protein or control cells. Preliminary data showed that the mutant-containing cells convert dihydroethidium almost 10 times faster than control cells (0.2 versus 1.9 units/min.). If continuing experimentation upholds this result, this model provides additional evidence to support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a role in neuronal cell death in Huntington’s disease.<br><br>

RESTRAINING RESTENOSIS: COMBATING VASCULAR DISEASE- YEAR 4
Julian Clint Hong
Ronald Reagan High School, San Antonio, TX, USA

Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are critical to arterial restenosis that follows procedures that reopen blocked arteries. Endothelial cells (EC), which form arterial lining, decrease SMC proliferation and migration but are controlled by varying levels of shear stress (frictional force exerted by flow of fluid). EC are significantly effective in SMC restriction under high shear (HS, 16 dyn/cm2), similar to that found in healthy arteries, and insignificantly counterproductive under low shear stress (LS, 2 dyn/cm2).<br><br>Two objectives were addressed: to determine how effective static models are as arterial simulations—arterial wall simulations are resource demanding and many conjectures are based on static results—and to effectively simulate SMC injury. It was hypothesized that HS would stimulate EC to reduce SMC migration while LS would increase SMC migration statistically significantly. <br><br>EC were subjected to regulated flow-associated shear stress and released factors were collected. SMC were cultured in static conditions, injured, and exposed to EC-released factors. Cells were also cultured under shear conditions in an EC to injured SMC circuit for comparison.<br><br>Results from static injury models insignificantly parallel expected results (p>0.05): HS EC media restricted SMC migration and LS EC increased migration. These findings support that while ineffective in simulating in vivo phenotypes and exhibiting the degree of effects, static models of SMC-EC interaction sufficiently elucidate trends, and are somewhat valid. They also further the importance of considering flow conditions when encouraging EC to recover arterial areas injured during procedures to open blocked arteries such as angioplasty and stenting.<br><br>

DOES C1498, A NATURAL KILLER T CELL LEUKEMIA, UTILIZE INTERLEUKIN-2 IN AN AUTOCRINE CIRCUIT?
Benjamin Kahn Boxer
Nicolet High School, Glendale, Wisconsin, United States

This experiment was designed to determine whether cells from a natural killer T cell (NKT) leukemia, C1498, utilize interleukin-2 (IL-2) in an autocrine circuit. This experiment is a continuation of personal research, which proved that C1498 has the alpha, the beta, and the gamma chains of the IL-2 receptor. The overall project is a three part experiment. This project researches the last two phases of the project. The second phase is designed to determine if added exogenous interleukin-2 has an effect on the growth pattern of C1498. The third phase of the project is designed to determine whether or not C1498 translates and synthesizes IL-2. Once the proliferation pattern of C1498 is discovered, then more experiments can be conducted on C1498 to find a method to inhibit its growth pattern and induce apoptosis.<br><br> The procedure for the second phase of the project involved adding exogenous interleukin-2 to C1498 and counting the number of viable and dead cells in the culture. In every case, the C1498 with IL-2 had a higher percentage of viable cells than the C1498 without IL-2. Therefore, it can be concluded that IL-2 has a positive affect on the growth pattern of C1498. <br><br> The procedure for the third phase of the project was conducted using a process of cellular staining and analysis with a flow cytometer. When the data was analyzed, the data demonstrated that C1498 translates and synthesizes IL-2. <br><br> The data from phases one, two, and three prove that C1498 utilizes IL-2 in an autocrine circuit. Since it has been identified that the C1498 cells proliferate via an autocrine circuit, the focus of the experimenter will be on a way to block that interaction, which would cause apoptosis. Future research will determine a specific way to block the autocrine circuit in the C1498 cells.<br><br>

THE SARS VIRUS - DIFFERENT METHODS OF CURBING THE EPIDEMIC
Jessica Anne Millar
School of Science and Technology; Beaverton, OR United States

During the SARS epidemic, there were many variables involved that effected the overall spread and finally the decline in the number of cases. Because there are so many options of travel available today and vast differences in government structures around the world, the SARS virus has many different ways of distributing itself among the populations. After comparing specific events of outbreaks and attempts to conceal the virus with a timeline of tabulated SARS cases, it seemed apparent that certain ways of distribution and concealment worked better in some countries and not as well in others. As a result, depending on the specific environment and structure with any region of the world, this will affect how the epidemic started and also how it could be contained.

A NOVEL METHOD OF ENHANCING PROSTATE CANCER RADIOSENSITIZATION BY NATURAL COMPOUND CURCUMIN
David Nima Meigooni
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY, USA

Curcumin [Diferuloylmethane] is a major component of turmeric [Curcuma longa], which is used as a spice to give a specific flavor and yellow color in Asian food. In this investigation, the application of curcumin as a radiation sensitizer on PC-3 prostate cancer cells was investigated. Curcumin at 2 M and 4 M concentrations in combination with radiation showed significant enhancement of clonogenic inhibition and apoptosis induced by radiation. The clonogenic enhancement of the radiation was found to be a factor of 2.61 and 7.00 for addition of 2 M and 4 M of curcumin, respectively. The enhancement of the radiation effect by curcumin can be partially attributed to the reduction or reversal of pro-survival factors (e.g. TNF- , NFkB, Bcl-2) within PC-3 cells, which normally occur when the cells are treated with radiation alone. In addition, the down regulation of Bcl-2 and no changes in Bax protein levels in curcumin plus radiation treated PC-3 cells, altered the Bcl-2:Bax ratio which caused the enhanced radiosensitization. Furthermore, significant activation of cytochrome c, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were observed in curcumin plus radiation treatments. Together, these mechanisms strongly suggest that the natural compound curcumin is a potent radiosensitizer through activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: A RELIEF FOR DIABETES (PHASE 3)
John Zeqi Luo
Bishop Hendricken High School, Warwick RI, USA

American ginseng root displays the ability to achieve glucose homeostasis both experimentally and clinically. However, the mechanisms used by ginseng to achieve its therapeutic effects on diabetes are generally unknown. Disruption of insulin secretion of pancreatic beta (B) cells is considered the major cause of diabetes. A mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) has been found to play a critical role in insulin synthesis and B-cell survival. Preliminary studies found extracts of American ginseng were able to prevent B cell death and improve insulin synthesis, which may be via regulation of UCP-2. Therefore, it is hypothesized that ginseng extracts suppresses UCP-2 in the mitochondria of pancreatic B cells, promoting insulin synthesis and preventing apoptosis (programmed cell death). To test this hypothesis, serum deprived quiescent B cells were cultured with or without Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) (200pg/ml, a cytokine to induced B cell apoptosis) and water extract of American ginseng (5ul administered to wells of .5mL culture) for 24 hours. The responses of UCP-2, insulin, anti/pro-apoptotic factors BcL-2/Caspase-9, and ATP levels to ginseng were measured by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, TUNEL Assay, and Luminescence. The results show that ginseng suppresses UCP-2, increases ATP, insulin production /secretion, and up-regulates BcL-2; all groups compared to IL-1B control (p<0.01), while down-regulating caspase-9 (58.6 +- 12.8 % vs. IL-1B] control 100%, p < 0.05) resulting in reduced apoptosis (22.0 +- 0.03 % vs. IL-1 B control 69.3 +- 3.0 %, p < 0.01). This study indicates that ginseng's stimulation of insulin production and prevention of B-cell loss is via inhibition of mitochondrial UCP-2 resulting in an increase of ATP, an up-regulation of anti-apoptotic factor BcL-2, and a down-regulation of pro-apoptotic factor caspase-9; lowering the occurrence of apoptosis, thus supporting the hypothesis.

L-SIGN AND DC-SIGN MEDIATE TRANS-INFECTION OF HUMAN LIVER CELLS BY HEPATITIS C VIRUS
Catherine Griffith Manix
Scarsdale High School, Scarsdale New York, Unites States of America

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) causes chronic infection in up to 70% of infected individuals and is a major cause of liver disease. Studies of HCV tropism have been limited by a lack of experimental fusion and entry models. With the recent development of an efficient entry assay, it is now possible to study the determinants of HCV tropism. It has been shown that L-SIGN and DC-SIGN, two related cell-surface attachment molecules that mediate cell-cell interactions within the immune system, are capture receptors for HCV. Consequently, this novel entry assay was used to examine the ability of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to mediate HCV trans-infection of hepatic cell lines. Murine cells expressing L-SIGN, DC-SIGN and CD81, a putative HCV receptor, were incubated with HCV pseudoviruses followed by co-culture with target cells. This resulted in trans-infection of the target cells by viral particles captured by L-SIGN and DC-SIGN. Capture of HCV particles by L-SIGN and DC-SIGN in the infected host may therefore facilitate infection of in vivo target cells and contribute to the spread of infection.

THE EFFECT OF INTERLEUKIN 4 AND 13 ON MAST CELLS AND EOSINOPHILS
Jonathan Kanevsky
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, United States of America

Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 play a major role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and the inflammatory response. In addition, mast cells and eosinophils are key mediators of the asthmatic response and these inflammatory cells may be affected by IL-4 and/or IL-13. Lung tissue and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected from two different animal models. The first mouse model was an ovalbumin-induced asthma model that mimics the human disease and the roles of IL-4 and IL-13 in it are clearly established. The second mouse model involved the instillation of IL-13 directly into the lungs, which establishes a phenotype similar to asthma. In the ovalbumin asthma model, histological analysis of lung samples collected 48 hours after the final challenge showed that IL-4 and IL-13 upregulated mast cell recruitment and inflammation. However, analysis of the BAL from the same model showed no detectable amount of eotaxin, a protein with a high chemotactic selectivity for eosinophils. In the IL-13 instillation model, histological analysis of lung samples collected 24 or 72 hours after the final challenge showed an increase in mast cell recruitment at both time points. Eosinophil activity was also upregulated by IL-13; BAL levels of eotaxin were increased 24 hours after the final challenge but not at 72 hours. Taken together, these data show that both IL-4 and IL-13 have marked effects on mast cells and eosinophils. Since these inflammatory cells are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, blockade or inhibition of these interleukins may be a potential therapeutic target.

GOT ABUSE? GET WATER! VOCAL ABUSE AND EFFECTS ON FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND VOCAL QUALITY
Margaret Pere' Jumonville
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States

The purpose of this experiment was twofold: to measure specific changes in frequency and altering vocal quality in individuals that undergo vocal abuse, and to observe the effects of hydration on the vocal folds. This experiment investigated the specific changes that hydration had on the individual parameters of the abused voice by using the Computerized Speech Lab. The major findings of this experiment were that considerable amounts of vocal abuse are harmful to many aspects of the voice. Prolonged vocal abuse will have a negative effect on the fundamental frequency and vocal quality of the voice, and hydration will improve vocal fold functioning. The hypothesis was that the fundamental frequency and vocal quality would be negatively affected by vocal abuse, and that hydration of the vocal folds would help to decrease the harmful affects that vocal abuse has on the vocal folds. Generally, the experiment verifies the hypothesis, from the position that vocal quality was affected by sustained vocal abuse, and that hydration of the vocal folds proved to aid abused voices. However, fundamental frequency was not proven to decrease after vocal abuse, but instead increase, thus opposing the first aspect of the hypothesis. This study confirmed that vocally abusive behavior negatively affects the vocal folds, and hydration assists in improving vocal quality.<br><br> <br><br>

ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES: A SIMULATION OF NATURAL FINGER MOVEMENT USING SILVER PALLADIUM ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS
Sushma Chennubhotla
Du Pont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, U.S.A

For this project, a model was constructed using electroactive polymers to simulate natural finger movement and thereby allude to its use in artificial muscles. An electroactive polymer was synthesized, tested and then used to construct a finger model allowing for simulation of natural finger movement. The hypothesis was that a finger-like movement from the model will be achieved and it will demonstrate electroactive polymer usage as it pertains to artificial muscles.<br><br> An electroactive polymer is a chemical compound that reacts to electrical force by movement. The specific objective of this project is to show the potential of electroactive polymers to function as artificial muscles which can take the place of prosthetic limbs. The advantage of artificial muscles made of electroactive polymers is that they allow for a smooth as well as graded movement whereas prosthetic limbs are limited in their function and scope and produce smaller rigid movements due to tiny metal pieces. <br><br> The project consisted of membrane synthesis, experimental testing and construction of a model. Materials for the membrane were obtained by the ERI Development Company. The experimental testing was done by creating a circuit by using copper leads and a 9-volt battery. Lastly, the model was created by attaching strips of the polymer resembling joints with small Styrofoam pieces fashioned to resemble a human finger. The main result was a creation of an electroactive polymer model capable of simulating natural finger movement and demonstrating the polymers’ usage in the field of prosthesis. <br><br>

HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY DIESEL FUMES
Sarah Elizabeth Nielson
Ensweiler Academy, Gary, Indiana, United States

<br><br> Pregnant girls, especially those who do not yet know they are pregnant and who breathe fumes, are putting their unborn children at risk. All people should make every effort to avoid breathing these fumes however young women who might be pregnant should make a special effort to avoid breathing these fumes.<br><br> Tests done on both developing plants and animals all indicate that diesel fumes pose a hazard. This hazard is not the same as the particulates that cause respiratory problems, it is in fact potentially more dangerous because it is water -soluble and is able to diffuse through the pleural membranes to enter our blood stream and to enter our water supply in precipitation into our rivers and lakes. Although the concentrations may be low, it seems that very small amounts of this toxin causes problems to the organisms in this study. <br><br> Bus drivers, students, commuters, and those who live near interstate highways or other areas where there is a large amount of truck traffic need to be aware of the potential danger that lurks in the air that they breath.<br><br> <br><br>

HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH: A STUDY IN ACETAMINOPHEN'S AFFECT ON THE DETOXIFICATION OF H2O2 BY CATALASE
Weston Wayne Brownlee
Frontier Academy, Greeley Colorado, USA

Catalase is an enyzme found within the liver. It performs one main function in detoxification processes that occur there. It is responsible for converting harmful H2O2, a natural waste product of the human body, into harmless water and oxygen.<br><br> This experiment was conducted in order to determine weather or not Acetaminophen has an affect on the Catalase reaction. It was hypothesized that it would, and that Acetaminophen would, in fact, inhibit this reaction.<br><br> The results of this experiment indicated that the more Acetaminophen was added to the solution, the longer the reaction took;the hypothesis was accepted.<br><br> Results not only showed that this reaction was slowed considerably by Acetaminophen, but that it also completely halted the reaction when 3900 mg of Acetaminophen was present in the solution.<br><br> These results indicate that Acetaminophen, while being an easily obtained and supposedly harmless substance, unless overdosed on, is in fact harmful to this reaction, and potentially the human liver.<br><br> This experiment presents these questions: How much Acetaminophen (Tylenol), actually enters the liver after consumption? What is the lowest dosage that slows the reaction? And how much H2O2 does it take to kill liver cells?

Finding treatments for asthma, a serious disease in children and adults, is a worldwide goal of clinical and laboratorial researchers. Evidence shows that Th2 T cells promote both production of IgE antibodies and asthmatic reactions, whereas Th1 T cells promote both production of subclasses of IgG antibodies and inflammation. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are the professional cells required to present the antigen bound to the MHC class II to the naïve CD4 T cells. The constellation of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of the DCs are known to influence the polarization of T cell differentiation toward effector Th1 or Th2. A two-phase investigation was aimed at revealing the mechanism of T cell differentiation. In phase I, microarray analysis of provided DCs exposed to different levels of bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed several differentially expressed cytokines. In Phase II, expression microarray and Real-Time PCR analyses of Th1 and Th2 cells at different time-points showed differential mRNA expression of several genes between these two cell types. One of these genes, Esm1, showed increased levels of expression in Th2 compared to Th1 cells, especially at 8 and 16 hours after activation. In humans, Esm1 is known to bind LFA1 and prevent LFA1-ICAM1 interactions, a co-stimulatory pathway important for Th1 development. SiRNA will be used to silence the expression of this gene in mouse T cells, and the potential consequences in Th2 differentiation will be evaluated. Studies of T cell activation mechanisms at the genetic level may provide the starting point for future drug development against asthma.

WEST NILE VIRUS: RUNNING RAMPANT
Daniel James Ozzello
Blevins Junior High, Fort Collins Colorado, United States of America

West Nile Virus has been spreading rapidly westward across the nation, and has hit Colorado very hard. It was reported that 42 people died of the disease, with thousands of others falling ill.<br><br> West Nile Virus is spread by infected mosquitoes, and is carried by many birds. Humans are infected when a mosquito bites a bird, and then bites a human. The only way the spread of this virus has been slowed is by the use of costly, synthetic pesticides that may have unknown effects on the environment.<br><br> This project focused on ways to effectively kill mosquitoes with pesticides made from organic substances. Since mosquitoes were not available, fruit flies were used instead. They are both from the “Fly order” of diptera, so are closely related. The purpose was to find a way to slow the virus without hurting the environment. Organic extracts and assays from coniferous trees were put in a base of acetone to test their killing ability on fruit flies. The assays were also used at different concentrations levels.<br><br> This experiment demonstrated that natural products can be extremely effective at killing flies form the diptera order, and could be used to help control mosquitoes and therefore West Nile Virus. The extracts did not all perform exactly the same, but all did perform well.<br><br> This information can be used on the development of new pesticides that may be far less harmful to the environment, and could lead to research on natural extracts and assays being used in repellents. <br><br>

COMPARISON OF TEETH WHITENING METHODS USING DIGITAL GRAYSCALE TECHNIQUE: PHASE II
Thomas Elliott Marshall
Statesboro High School, Statesboro, Georgia, US

The purpose of this project was to compare the effects of hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide on teeth. I hypothesized that hydrogen peroxide would whiten the teeth to a greater degree than the carbamide peroxide would. Teeth were collected and sterilized. The roots were removed and the teeth were split. The halves were then glued onto glass microscope slides and labeled. The teeth were photographed before and after being treated. The treatment consisted of two over-the-counter products: Crest Whitestrips and Rembrandt Whitening gel. These were chosen because they were in Phase I, and they contain hydrogen peroxide and carbomide peroxide respectively. The teeth were separated into groups and assigned a treatment. Some teeth were assigned to control groups where they would receive no treatment. Ten treatments were done between the sets of pictures taken. The pictures were then analyzed in Adobe Photoshop 5.5. The teeth were magnified and converted to grayscale. Ten random spots were chosen on the surface of the tooth where a number known as a k-factor (percent gray where 0% is pure white and 100% is pure black) was retrieved. These percents were then averaged together to get an average percent whiteness for each tooth. This provided for the raw data which could then be analyzed. When the results were statistically analyzed, it was proven that all groups treated whitened significantly as a result of the treatments. However, there was no significant difference in the ability of each product to whiten the teeth. This disproves the hypothesis.

HEMODYNAMICS, HORMONES, AND HEART FAILURE SOFTWARE DESIGN, ICG RELIABILITY TESTING AND UTILIZATION--YEAR 1
Winston Harmon Messer
Presbyterian Christian High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA

Congestive heart failure (CHF) costs $56 billion dollars/year. Better management can reduce symptoms, mortality, hospital readmissions and expenditure. This project designed custom software for a new outpatient CHF clinic and evaluated noninvasive hemodynamic (ICG) monitoring as a test to assess CHF treatment progress.<br><br> <br><br> The engineering goals were met by writing custom software for a new outpatient CHF clinic. An 80 variable paperless chart for monitoring patient progress was designed using Visual Basic. <br><br> Experimental goals for this project included testing ICG’s reliability (Phases II-III) and ICG’s ability to measure patient progress (Phase IV). To date, no test has been shown to do this reliably for outpatient management of heart failure. Phase II established that the 2 minute value was the expedient, accurate choice, but also defined, with standard error of the mean, the range of variation to be expected for a normal patient. With this data, the test could be used to measure treatment progress. Phase IV documented the expected ICG improvement using standard error of the mean for 30 patients with Class III and IV CHF. In addition, Phase III showed ICG cardiac output results comparable to echocardiography (p=0.972), while ICG is less expensive.<br><br> Phase IV showed significant improvement in mean arterial pressure (p=.004) and systemic vascular resistance index (p=.006) when ICGs were taken before and after intravenous nesiritide therapy (N=30). This demonstrates ICG’s utility in measuring patient improvement with outpatient CHF treatment, and suggests the important role of ICG monitoring as a tool to assess intravenous nesiritide infusion success. <br><br>

IMMUNOSTIMULATING PROPERTIES OF A HERBAL POLYSACCHARIDE FROM TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA FOR BIODENSE AND TREATMENT
Reshma Ramachandran
Coral Reef Senior High School, Miami, FL, USA

The impact of a weak immune system has taken on added significance with the increasing resistance of pathogens against currently available antibiotics and antifungal medications, recent outbreak of deadly pathogens like sever acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, increasing epidemic of HIV-AIDS, and also because of the real possibility of bioterrorism. Immunostimulating herbal compounds have also gained importance recently because of the increasing incidence of several deadly viral diseases. In vitro laboratory studies were performed to identify the active compound in Tinospora cordifolia, a medicinal herb commonly used for its immunostimulating properties in India and China. <br><br>A novel immunostimulating polysaccharide (RR-1) was isolated, which was found to increase the activation of T, B and NK cells significantly. RR-1, a (1,4)- -D-Glucan, is one of the first alpha polysaccharides having immunostimulating properties. RR-1 treatment of normal lymphocytes at 100 ug/ml also induced a 50% increase in functional NK cell activity as measured by their ability to induce tumor cell death. RR-1 induced the synthesis of cytokines such as Interleukin-12, IL-18, Tumor necrosis factor- , and Interferon- , which are associated with the Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation and NK cell activity, in addition to the upregulation of IL-1 , IL-6 and MCP-1 in normal lymphocytes. RR-1 treatment of human lymphocytes also induced synthesis of nitric oxide at a lower level, although no change was noticed in the oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione. The activation of cytokines and chemokines leading to T, B and NK cell activation coupled with absence of oxidative stress indicates the clinical potential of RR-1 as a general immune stimulator for human use.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF A TRUNCATED FORM OF SLOW SKELETAL TROPONIN T THAT CAUSES NEMALINE MYOPATHY
Lisha Laura Constantine
American Senior High, Miami, Florida, USA

To determine the effects of a slow skeletal troponin T (SSTnT) Nemaline Myopathy causing mutation on the physiological function of troponin T, the force development in skinned fiber and ATPase activity in reconstituted Actomyosin assays were investigated. Both assays showed that the truncated SSTnT showed impaired ability to inhibit myosin ATPase activity and relaxation of force development in skinned fibers. The truncated SSTnT was also unable to form troponin complexes. These results suggest that interaction between the truncated troponin T and troponin I and/or troponin C are affected. The truncated SSTnT was also capable of activating actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of calcium. These results suggest that the 11 residues present at the C-terminal of truncated slow skeletal troponin T are important for activating Actomyosin ATPase activity.

DETECTION OF ANOMALOUS TRICHROMASY THROUGH COMPUTER ASSISTED ANALYSIS OF THE CONSENSUAL PUPILLARY RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT
Andrew A. Lenoir
Gulliver Preparatory Miami, FL 33156

The purpose of this experiment is to find a new way to test for anomalous trichromasy in all eye colors in pediatric patients. It is hypothesized that a pattern of response of the consensual pupillary response will differ between normal sighted persons and those with anomalous trichromasy when subjects are exposed to various wavelengths of light.<br><br> Previous experiments have led up to this year's refined process of collecting and analyzing data. Subject's (aged 7-21) eyes are exposed, one at a time, to specific wavelengths of light of a specific intensity while the consensual pupillary responses are recorded using original software. Elimination of all extra light is crucial to the results.<br><br> Responses are analyzed four ways: latency period, speed of response, proportional pupil to iris change, and adjustment phase. Normal vision subjects responded to the test with a large range of variation that seemed unique for each subject. Color deficient subjects, however, responded similarly in the sense that their response has a similar pattern when compared to their response to white (all wavelengths less any ultra violet).<br><br> Statistical analysis was done for each subject as individual trial tests where responses to one wavelength is compared to responses to the other wavelengths. Due to the fact that no research has been done in this area before and tests results are compiled from multiple variables the Chi-Squared test, as well as the T-test and the Z-test does not offer as an optimum way to test this project statistically. It can be concluded, however, that the current system of testing the consensual pupillary response offers a new way to test for anomalous trichromasy. More testing, however, is required. Future tests will focus on testing the accuracy of the software.<br><br>

VITRIFICATION OF HUMAN OOCYTES AND BOVINE OOCYTES AND EMBRYOS
Justin Huai Jin Tan
Selwyn House School, Westmount, Quebec, Canada

Frozen sperm has been used to treat infertile couples for many years. If unfertilized embryos & oocytes can also be frozen, it will be a major advance in the treatment of infertility and preservation of female fertility. Recently, a new method of freezing called vitrification has been introduced. The first objective was to establish the optimum method of vitrifying bovine oocytes, namely, the ideal cryoprotectant (Ethylene glycol (EG) + propanediol (PROH) or Ethylene glycol + Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)); to determine whether eggs should be vitrified with, or without cumulus cells; and the effects of a 0, 2, or 4 hour pre-incubation time before vitrification on subsequent embryonic development. The second objective was to use this method to vitrify bovine blastocysts and human eggs. <br><br> The use of 15% EG and 15% PROH for denuded bovine oocytes, blastocysts, and human oocytes with no pre-incubation is the best method of Vitrification (90-94% survival rate for bovine oocytes. 100% survival rate for human oocytes and bovine blastocysts (61.7% hatching rate)). It yields on average 20% better success rates than the present “slow-freezing” method and comparable results to the control group. This opens the door to large scale clinical studies on the vitrification of human eggs. <br><br> This procedure will allow for the creation of “egg banks”, similar to “sperm banks”, to help infertile women who require oocyte donation. It will help preserve fertility in adolescent cancer survivors after cancer treatment and also in women who wish to freeze their oocytes, with the intention of having children later in life.

COMPUTER IDENTIFICATION OF CARDIAC MURMURS
Craig Monsen
Regis High School, New York, NY, USA

Millions of Americans exhibit heartbeats with characteristic abnormalities known as cardiac murmurs. Oftentimes, murmurs that suggest a pathological threat to the patient go unnoticed by standard auscultation procedures. Without proper detection, the valvular conditions that create the murmur can worsen over time and eventually become fatal. The purpose of this study is to achieve accurate detection of cardiac murmurs using a computer-based expert system. Approximately fifty heartbeats representing varying magnitudes and types of murmurs were recorded and normalized for time and amplitude. Band-pass filtering was performed on the waveforms both to optimize the data and to aid in the recognition process. Presently, the method can be used to distinguish normal heartbeats from those with a murmur and recognize two common classifications of murmurs, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Future work includes using the optimized waveforms for training and testing of an independent neural network algorithm capable of classifying a variety of murmur types. The resulting system would allow for inexpensive, high-volume screening of patients and represent immense clinical utility.

STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT, FIRST COLOR I SEE TONIGHT AN INVESTIGATION OF COLOR PERCEPTION AT LOW LEVELS OF LIGHT
Candace Elizabeth WALL
Seton School, Manassas, Virginia, U.S.A.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether or not humans distinguish different colors in varying degrees at low levels of light. It was hypothesized that some colors would be seen earlier than others at very low light intensities. By analyzing the responses of subjects tested to see what colors they saw at low levels of light, conclusions could be drawn about which colors could be seen, and when. <br><br> Subjects were asked to look into an observation box and identify what colors they saw in the box at varying levels of light. Each response was recorded based on which swatch of color they were asked to view, and the level of light at which they were observing. The levels at which the colors were correctly identified were recorded and plotted on graphs. <br><br> The data indicated that some colors were recognized before others. Overall, the data shows most people can see colors in a yellow / red, green, and then blue order, as the light intensity increases. Some of these differences were statistically significant.

COMPARATIVE EVOLUTIONARY STUDY OF MENDELIAN INHERITED DISEASES USING COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS
Jeffrey M. Bhasin
Rocky River High School, Rocky River, Ohio USA

Comparative evolutionary studies yield useful information about human genetic disease. Genes found to exhibit patterns of Mendelian inheritance are ideal for comparative genomic studies because of the existence of distinct wild type (“normal”) and mutant (“disease”) alleles. It is hypothesized that some disease alleles that have arisen in humans can exist as wild type alleles in ancestral species. This comparative evolutionary study identified protein sequence differences between species in regard to specific gene loci. Computational analysis of data available in public genome sequence and human disease gene mutation databases was performed to discover whether normal ancestral alleles appear as disease-causing mutations in humans. Three disease genes were chosen for this study: Cystic Fibrosis, Marfan Syndrome, and the BRCA1 Breast Cancer gene. Multiple sequence alignments, or comparisons, using computational methods, were utilized for protein sequences from wild type human protein sequence and protein sequences available in GenBank for as many other organisms as possible. A computer program was developed to determine if any human mutations were present as wild type sequences for the other organisms in the alignment and to compile such locations into list form. Phylogenetic trees and domain maps were generated to aid in interpreting the list. Alleles that cause disease in humans were found relatively prevalent as wild type in other species, supporting the hypothesis. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of these genetic diseases. More study on these detailed differences opens the door for new and improved disease treatments.

ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL TREATMENT ALTERS NMDA RECEPTOR: EVIDENCE FROM IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL AND RECEPTOR BINDING STUDIES
Debashish Sircar
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY, USA

Alcohol is the number one abused substance among adolescents. Adolescents who use alcohol are prone to become excessive users of alcohol, and of other substances of abuse, later in life. Alcohol exposure during the adolescent period has been shown to negatively impact learning and memory. Mechanisms underlying this alcohol-induced memory deficit are unknown. The hypothesis tested here was that in the adolescent rat, alcohol modulates the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) class of glutamate receptors in the brain. Frontal cortex and hippocampal brain tissue from male adolescent rats (postnatal day 30), which had been treated with alcohol or saline, were received from a previous study by my mentor. NMDA receptor (NR) density and NR subunit protein levels were studied using radioligand binding assay and immunohistochemical techniques. Significant increases in tritiated MK-801 labeled NR binding in the frontal cortex were found in treated tissue, compared to control. Levels of NR1 and NR2B subunit proteins in the frontal cortex of alcohol exposed rats also showed robust increases. There was no change in hippocampal NR binding activity, but NR1 and NR2A subunit levels showed increases. Unlike the increase in NR binding in the frontal cortex following long delay, during alcohol withdrawal there was significant reduction in NR binding in that brain region. These data indicate that the biochemical changes in long term alcohol effects are different from those during withdrawal, and that the frontal cortex is important in adolescent alcohol-mediated effects. This study provides the first biochemical evidence linking NR regulation in adolescent alcohol exposure.

To determine the effect of cytoprotectants on the formation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens tumors in tomatoes; how cytoprotectants affect Drosophila melanogaster exposed to copper sulfate and; the effect of amifostine on radiation-induced xerostomia and mucositis in patients with head/neck cancer.<br><br> The grades of mucositis and xerostomia of eleven anonymous head/neck cancer patients, receiving the cytoprotectant amifostine, were evaluated by reviewing the patients’ charts and progress notes and then comparing to national averages. <br><br> Colostrum, misoprostol, quercetin and sucralfate were given to tomato plants which had been inoculated with A. tumefaciens. The circumference of each tumor and the stem was measured weekly.<br><br> Cytoprotectant solutions and .1 and .01 molar copper sulfate were mixed with D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis medium. Fruit flies were anesthetized with FlyNap; six male and six female were placed into each vial. The number of flies still living was counted daily. <br><br> 1% Sucralfate produced the most significantly smallest A. tumefaciens tumors, relative to the stem circumference. All of the cytoprotectant-treated plants had significantly smaller tumors compared to the positive control.<br><br> D. melanogaster, exposed to .1M copper sulfate, had the lowest mortality rate in the 5% Colostrum environment. D. melanogaster, exposed to .01 M copper sulfate, has the lowest mortality rate in the 1% misoprostol environment. All of the mortality rates were significantly lower than the positive control. <br><br> As compared to the national averages, the mucositis grades were slightly higher. Of the xerostomia grades, 72.72% were grade one, compared to the national average were 3% were grade one.

FACTORS LEADING TO THE COMPUTER VISION SYNDROME: AN ISSUE AT THE CONTEMPORARY WORKPLACE
Juan Carlos Izquierdo-Amieiro
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico

 Vision and eye related problems are common among computer users. They have been collectively called the Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). An observational study in order to identify the risk factors leading to the CVS was done.<br><br> Twenty-eight participants answered a validated questionnaire, and had their workstations examined. The questionnaire evaluated personal, environmental,ergonomic factors, and physiologic response of computer users. The distance from the eye to the computers’ monitor (A), the computers’ monitor height (B), and visual axis height (C) were measured. The difference between B and C was calculated and labeled as D. Angles of gaze to the computer monitor were calculated using the formula: angle=tan-1(D/A). Angles were divided into two groups including: in Group 1 participants with angles of gaze ranging from 0° to 13.9°; and in Group 2 participants gazing at angles larger than 14°. Statistical analysis of the evaluated variables was made. <br><br> Computer users in both groups used more tear supplements (as part of the syndrome), than expected. This association was statistically significant (p<0.10). Participants in Group 1 reported more pain than participants in Group 2. Associations between the CVS and other personal or ergonomic variables were not statistically significant.<br><br> These findings show that most important factor leading to the syndrome is the angle of gaze at the computer monitor. Pain in computer users is diminished when gazing downwards at angles of 14° or more. The CVS remains an under estimated and poorly understood issue at the workplace. The general public, health professionals, the government and private industries need to be educated about the CVS.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RETINOTECTAL MAPPING IN THE EVALUATION OF VISUAL FUNCTION IN A RAT MODEL FOR GLAUCOMA
Colleen Melinda Moreland
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany NY, USA

Glaucoma is a disease that causes death of retinal nerve cells, specifically of the rods. Rods detect light and convert the response into electrical impulses that can be sent to the visual area of the brain via the optic nerve. Understanding how signals are transmitted along this retinotectal pathway ("from the retina to the brain") is essential to the future design of methods to reverse glaucoma. An electrode inserted into the visual area of the adult female rat brain detects nerve impulses the brain receives. The electrode positioned in the left-brain is used to determine if rods in the right eye can detect light stimuli and successfully transmit the impulses. The accuracy of the rods to detect light is depicted by a visual field map created using a Bausch & Lomb projection perimeter. Visual fields are geometric shapes that indicate the rat's ability to view a specific point. Control rats were found to have small, congruous visual fields. Experimental rats were found to have large, incongruous visual fields. Experimental rat visual fields indicate glaucoma because the disease has caused rod death in the eye, inhibiting the animal's ability to view specific areas of its environment. The results prove that rod death inhibits signal transmission by impairing the animal's ability to detect stimuli, form impulses, and relay them to the brain. Research using rats correlates to glaucoma’s human effects because human rods also die. Researchers can now focus on restoring localized brain function in glaucoma patients to overcome the disease’s effects.

COMPUTER MODELING AND SIMULATION OF SMALLPOX OUTBREAKS AND ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL AND INTERVENTION MEASURES
Stephanie Iris Mok
Mount Saint Mary Academy, Watchung, New Jersey, United States

An original smallpox epidemic computer simulation model that used a scaleable spatial modeling concept was developed to predict outbreak intensity and patterns. This project devised a decision support modeling tool that sought to provide quantitative assessment of population risk during a viral epidemic under various outbreak intervention and control scenarios. To do so, a stochastic simulation model was constructed that incorporated realistic smallpox infection patterns, human social networking/connectivity, and metropolitan spatial/demographic characteristics. The methodology used involved a combination of finite-state modeling and graph theory on a visual simulation platform that depicted disease propagation through ‘chance encountering’ and ‘social connectivity’ for a virtual community. <br><br> Outcomes of this research provided insight into the way smallpox epidemics may spread in large cities and addressed issues on when to vaccinate the public (preemptive or post-release vaccination) and how the vaccination program should be delivered (mass or target vaccination). Also produced in this project was a smallpox epidemic risk assessment chart that predicts human casualties for the major cities in the United States. Results of the simulation were evaluated using statistical correlation analysis, testing hypothesis, and regression modeling. <br><br> Through the simulation results, it was determined that mass vaccination is a more effective intervention policy than target vaccination, and that there is no significant difference between preemptive and post-release mass vaccination when less than 50% of the population is vaccinated. At vaccination levels above 50%, preemptive mass vaccination is the more effective intervention policy.<br><br>

ALTERATION OF MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION IN NON-HEART BEATING DONOR (NHBD) LIVERS
Tyra Michelle Pendergrass
Harding University High School Charlotte, N.C. USA

<br><br>Problems have arisen concerning the regeneration ability of Non-Heart Beating Donor (NHBD) livers. When stored by simple cold storage, livers exhibit many problems regenerating function once transplantation is complete. The limitation seems to be due to the lack of energy (ATP) present in the liver at the end of storage. The lack of a constant supply of ATP can cause both functional and structural damage within the liver. The purpose of this experiment is to deduce whether limited mitochondrial function affects the regeneration ability of NHBD livers. Mentor provided livers that underwent 30 minutes of warm ischemia and were either stored by Simple Cold Storage (SCS) for a period of 5 hours at 37 °C or Hypothermal Machine Perfusion Preservation (MPP) for 5 hours at 37 °C. Controls went through a period of 30 min. warm ischemia. The livers were homogenized, and the mitochondria were isolated from the liver through high powered spins in the centrifuge machine. Substrates (succinate, rotenone, malate, pyruvate) were added to the mitochondria to induce oxygen consumption and thus ATP production. The mitochondria’s Respiratory Control Ratios (RCR) were analyzed via the Clark Electrode (which measured the mitochondria’s oxygen consumption) and the Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (which measured the amount of ATP being produced). The Respiratory Control Ratios in the control and livers preserved by machine perfusion were found to be similar. However, the mitochondria of livers stored by simple cold storage yielded a lower RCR value; indicating that there is indeed functional damage to the mitochondria in livers stored by simple cold storage, and ultimately affecting the liver’s regeneration ability.<br><br>

CT COLONOGRAPHY: REDUCING PERCEPTIVE ERRORS
Kristina Therese Johnson
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN, USA

Introduction: Most errors at CT Colonography (CTC) are due to perceptive errors. Reducing perceptive mistakes at CTC would translate into fewer cancer related deaths. Virtual pathology(VP) is a novel type of image display that displays the whole colon (360?) as if it were lying open and flat.<br><br> Aims: 1). Evaluate distortion of VP images in a phantom 2). Evaluate the performance of VP in a selected human population 3). Evaluate the added benefit of double reading. 4). Evaluate the added benefit of computer aided diagnosis(CAD) in conjunction with virtual pathology. <br><br> Methods: 1). A colon phantom containing 140 polyps of 5,7,10, and 12 mm polyps (flat, sessile, and pedunculated) was scanned using conventional CTC technique. Using VP the presence of the polyp shape, and type of image distortion was noted. 2). Blinded review was preformed in a high prevalence population of twenty patients (15 with proven polyps and 5 with negative colons). The added benefit of double reading and CAD was calculated.<br><br> Results: 1). Distortion (polyp elongation) occurred mainly along the longitudinal axis of the colon. Three polyp shapes were present (club, pea and flame shaped). Haustral distortion also occurred. 2). In patients, sensitivity for the detection of polyps > 1 cm varied between 83%-94%. Double reading increased the sensitivity to 94%-100%. CAD increased sensitivity to 88-94%.<br><br> Conclusion: Anatomic distortion is encountered at VP, but can be understood. Polyp detection using VP is similar to reported conventional CTC, but can be improved with the use of double reading or CAD. <br><br>

ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT OF ALOE VERA INNER GEL
Ramón Gómez Moreno
Thomas Alva Edison School, Caguas, Puerto Rico

In a previous investigation it was found that Triclosan was the most effective antiseptic on five skin bacteria. But this antiseptic is a carcigenic agent and now the investigator tried to find a natural antibacterial compound. The hypothesis was that the Aloe vera plant( Aloe Barbadensis miller) has inhibitory effects on skin bacteria. The investigator developed a procedure were positive and negative control were tested to ensure that the bacteria were alive and that the culture medium were not contaminated with saprophyte bacteria. The five lyophilized bacteria used were the same as last year: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundi and Klebsiella pneumonae. The rehydrated bacteria were adjusted to a turbidity of aproximately 1.5x10 CFU/ml by comparing its turbidity to a Mc Farland 0.5. Two grams of Aloe vera inner gel were added to each standarized broth and then the solution was vortex for ten seconds. After 24 hrs of incubation a sample of each broth was taken using a calibrated loop ( 0.01mL) to be subcultivated in blood agar for 24 hrs and 72 hrs. After incubation period with Aloe vera inner gel the agar plate did not show inhibitory effect in all five bacteria bi the method used. Literature describes that Aloe vera is an unstable plant and maybe the protein responsible for its alleged inhibitory effect can decompose very easily. Therefore it would be interesting to isolate the protein in this plant and testit directly with the bacteria.

The initial phase of the project is designed to see if the general public’s cell phones even carry bacteria. Then, if bacteria is found to be growing on the phones, I will identify if there is pathogenic bacteria present. Finally, I will test to find what is the most efficient means of sanitizing a cell phone: warm soapy water, Lysol spray, bleach, or rubbing (70% isopropyl) alcohol.<br><br>I collected samples from 20 phones at a basketball game. I proceeded to use cotton tip applicators to streak the samples onto TSA II Blood Agar plates. I incubated the plates at 37 degrees Celsius for 48 hours and recorded the growth by counting the colonies on each plate. Next I collected five more phones to test for bacterial growth and also to check which cleaning agent would sanitize the phones best. Finally I Gram stained 8 samples to check for Gram positive or negative rods and cocci.<br><br>In conclusion only 5 out of the 25 cell phones did not grow out bacteria. I was able to identify the pathogenic bacteria Beta Hemolytic Streptococcus. I found that using soapy water only sanitized 60 percent of the phones, while the other three sanitized 80 percent. I also found that none of the 4 cleaning agents were able to kill the Streptococcus. Using Lysol again did not kill the Streptococcus. After 4 days it had not died naturally, so I used bleach again and after allowing it to dry longer, it killed the Streptococcus.<br><br>

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT MEDICINAL PLANTS AGAINST TINEA VERSICOLOR
Rene Miguel Rodriguez
Ana Roque de Duprey High School, Humacao, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this investigation was to find if certain medicinal plants can help to eliminate the Tinea versicolor or spots on the skin. The hypothesis was that the use of medicinal plants such as the almond tree (Ammigdalus communis), the aloe (Aloe vera), and the wild berry (Fregaria vesca) are effective to eliminate the skin spot condition of Tinea versicolor. To use these household remedies, the wild berry (Fregaria vesca) leaves were well washed, the jelly sap of aloe (Aloe vera) was obtained from the plant leaves and the almond tree (Ammigdalus communis) infusion was prepared boiling 4 leaves and some pieces of cortex in a liter of water. The household remedies were applied for 30 days to an adult person who had the condition of Tinea versicolor.<br><br>The spots from the skin of an adult person were treated with Aloe vera sap for 30 days but no changes were observed in the treated spots. The leaves of Fregaria vesca were rubbed against the affected area for 30 days and no changes were observed. The infusion of leaves of Ammigdalus communis was similarly applied for 30 days and notable changes were observed. The spots of the skin were erased almost completely and it was hard to see where they had been before the treatment. Of the three plants used only the Ammigdalus communis was effective against Tinea versicolor.

EFFECT OF CHLORINE ON LUNG FUNCTION OF OUDOOR SWIMMERS
Samuel Gregory Finlayson
San Ramon Valley High School. Danville, California. USA

This project tested the hypothesis that exposure to chlorine through swim training in outdoor pools adversely affects the lung function of swimmers. <br><br> Research consisted of a survey and controlled testing. A survey of competitive swimmers obtained information about history of asthma symptoms, and timing of onset relative to commencement of swim training. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) testing was conducted on swimmers before, immediately after, and one hour after six two-hour training sessions. Chlorine levels in water (chemical tests) and air above water (gas sampling) were obtained and compared to changes in PEF. Chlorine levels in sweat of swimmers were also obtained and compared with PEF. Control subjects simultaneously exercised outdoors away from the pool, and were monitored under same protocol. <br><br> The survey found that 44% of swimmers reported suffering from asthma, 73% of whom experienced symptoms for the first time after beginning competitive swim training. Testing found significant post-exercise decreases in PEF (>10% change) in all swimmers, but in 0% of controls. Decreases in PEF correlated with increased levels of chlorine in water (p=.001) and air (p=.05). Chloramines were found in swimmers’ sweat, but did not correlate with PEF. <br><br> The study suggests that under certain environmental conditions chlorine levels in outdoor pools can make swim training more likely a cause of asthma than a remedy for it. Results indicate potential benefits of chlorine-free technologies for pool disinfecting. Observation that PEF declined most on windless days suggests possible benefits of fan ventilation. Further research suggested. <br><br>

LACTEUS IRON ENRICHED MILK FOR CHILDREN
Renata Schmidt Witt
Fundação Liberato, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil

The anemy is the most common nutricional lack in the world affecting as many countries developed as in development. The World Health Organization esteem that 1,3 billion of people has deficiency of iron or anemia and 1,2 billion of these people are in the in development countries. The majority of the individuals affected is children of first infancy, which are susceptible for its fast growth and insufficience of iron in the diet. <br><br>So that if it solves this problem of public health, much has been argued concerning the enriched food use. The objective of this project is to evaluate the efficiency of fluid daily milk consumption added of iron amino acid quelate to combat the anemy, in children in the band of the twelve months. <br><br>Seventeen children with anemia considered moderate for the standards of the WHO had been in such a way studied, they receive 10mg from elementary iron day, during the period of two months. This dosage was determined from sensorial analyses and is in accordance with the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. <br><br>Interviews with the mothers, show that the effect of the intervention had been observed to the end of the period of consumption of enriched milk. It could be observed that a significant number of children had an appetite increase, and improvement in the quality of sleep.<br><br> It was considered, in the study, that the used product had a positive impact in the quality of life of the studied children. <br><br>

A KEY TO MS? ALPHA LIPOIC ACID AND GLATIRAMER ACETATE AS INHIBITORS OF NITRIC OXIDE
Katie Joy Nicholas
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA

It was hypothesized that both alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and glatiramer acetate (GA) would effectively reduce the NO levels in LPS-induced mouse macrophage cells, which are often used in scientific studies to simulate damaged cells similar to those found in MS patients.<br><br> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system. For an unknown reason, the body's cells attack the myelin sheath that protects various nerve fibers. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in MS is still in dispute, but it is thought that it may play a role in the destruction of the myelin sheaths. <br><br> The cell line was kept in a CO2 incubator at 37 degrees C and transferred to 24-well culture plates. Four separate tests were performed comparing the control (cells with no treatment); cells with LPS; cells with LPS pre- and post-treated with either ALA or GA, and all cells treated with ALA or GA at the time of LPS induction.<br><br> Absorption of the samples and Greiss reagent was read at 550 nm and NO levels were calculated in uM nitrite from the standard curve.<br><br> The LPS-stimulated cells were compared to GA- and ALA- treated cells and a statistically significant reduction of NO was observed with each chemical treatment. This study shows that GA and ALA are both effective treatments to reduce NO levels in macrophage cells and may be an effective treatment for MS patients. <br><br>

DIABETES: DOES ANAEROBIC OR AEROBIC EXERCISE HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON BLOOD SUGAR?
Alisha Brynn Martinez
Carbon High School, Price, Utah, USA

Most people have heard that exercise is good for them. It is especially good for someone with diabetes because it helps metabolize blood sugar. This experiment is to see if aerobic or anaerobic exercises have greater impact on blood sugar in people with diabetes. <br><br> Aerobic exercise is activity that is continuous and uses the heart, lungs and muscles. Anaerobic exercise is a brief, intense activity in which muscle fibers derive energy to contract from stored internal compounds without raising the heart rate significantly. In this experiment I tested two aerobic and two anaerobic exercises. <br><br> My hypothesis is that aerobic exercise will lower blood sugar on average more than anaerobic exercise. I think that all exercises will have some impact on blood sugar levels.<br><br> During this experiment I had four test subjects with diabetes. I had them do each of four exercises twice. Each exercise was conducted on a different day so the impact of earlier exercise would not invalidate the experiment. I conducted this test on four test subjects. Three of the subjects were teen-agers and have Type 1 diabetes. The fourth subject was my principal and he has Type 2 diabetes. <br><br> I found that all exercises lowered blood sugar levels most of the time. Exercise lowered blood sugar in 26 out of 32 individual trials. My hypothesis was right, aerobic exercise did lower blood sugar more on average. Aerobic exercise lowered blood sugar levels 27.3 points on average Anaerobic exercise lowered blood sugar levels 20.8 on average. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF INDOLE-3-CARBINOL FOUND IN CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES ON THE ACCUMULATION OF P53 IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Janna Lynn Tomsheck
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT, United States of America

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is a major component in several biochemical pathways that include transcription, DNA repair, genomic stability, cell-cycle control, and apoptosis. Some food-related anti-carcinogens reduce cancer response in experimental animals by reducing the amount of initial DNA damage. This study was conducted to determine if by consuming the cruciferous vegetable, broccoli, the active compound, indole-3-carbinol, would affect the apoptotic pathway through p53 to decrease DNA damage. Broccoli juice was extracted mimicking the mammalian digestive property of chewing and added to Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the p53 band was measured for thickness. T-<br><br>Test results reveal that the broccoli juice and the parent compound indole-3-carbinol has a significant effect on the levels of p53. Based on p values, all other tests supported the null hypothesis. Therefore the expected hypothesis that broccoli extract and indole-3-carbinol has an effect on a cell’s p53 levels can be accepted. This suggests that the induction of indole-3-carbinol could have triggered a protective response in the cell that would have alerted the p53 gene to the possible danger and led to apoptosis. <br><br>

DEVELOPING INORGANIC SPERMICIDES
Danna Lee McNett
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO, United States

Nonoxynol-9, the most commonly used spermicide today, increases the risk of contracting UTI’s and STD’s, along with many other health problems. The purpose of this research was to synthesize new spermicidal compounds by combining various metallic salts of zinc, iron, and copper with EDTA or phenanthroline. The phenanthroline was combined with each salt in a 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, and the EDTA in a 1:1 ratio. Three different molar concentrations were tested (0.1M, 0.05M, and 0.01M). The compounds of phenanthroline were verified by UV spectrophotometry and pH levels of all compounds were tested. I then determined the spermicidal properties of each compound by rating gross motility of the bull sperm over a 20-minute period. It was discovered that all compounds were spermicidal, except some in the 0.01 molarity. The cupric compounds were the most ideal as a possible spermicide: these compounds were spermicidal and pH levels were similar to normal vaginal pH. It was inconclusive whether the pH or the metal was killing the sperm. The compounds were buffered to the same pH and the motility of the sperm was rated to determine if the metals were, in fact, spermicidal.

TARGETING THE TUMOR
Soumo De
St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, Mississippi, United States of America

Nonspecific action of chemotherapeutic drugs limits therapeutic effect in tumors. Therefore, a targeted drug delivery approach for localizing an anti-cancer drug to cultured tumor cells was developed. Three genes were inserted into a pet-25 plasmid. The anti-cancer drug, Ras/Raf inhibitor peptide, which interferes with interaction of Ras and Raf proteins in the signal transduction pathway for growth of cancer cells, was linked to the carrier, Elastin-like-polypeptide (ELP), which can precipitate onto a cell’s surface at elevated temperature. ELP codon sequence was also annealed to a membrane-penetrating sequence, Penetratin, on the other end. Through transformation the cloned plasmids were inserted into Escherishia coli BLR cells for expression of the protein Penetratin-ELP-Ras/Raf inhibitor. The protein was purified and tested for its entry into and effect on T-24 bladder cancer cells. The results showed that there is a temperature dependent effect such that at 42oC there is an increase in cancer cell death as compared to 37oC. Also there is a concentration-dependent effect of the protein on bladder cancer cells. Thus Penetratin-ELP-Ras/Raf protein was able to enter and kill cancer cells under hyperthermic conditions.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM USING AIS-INSPIRED METHODS: PHASE II
Stephen Robert Ra
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, Virginia, United States

During the past few decades, artificial intelligence has found increased inspiration from biology. Now, many modern computational paradigms draw their intrinsic structure from biological concepts and theories in order to solve complex real-world problems. An area of biologically-inspired computational intelligence that has recently witnessed a huge proliferation in interest and growth is artificial immune systems (AIS). AIS incorporate concepts derived from immunology in order to develop intelligent systems capable of performing a wide range of tasks; they have the potential and are capable of being applied to numerous fields of sophisticated research including robotics, biomedical engineering, and medicine. <br><br>Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the male population of the United States. One way of reducing the chances of death of a patient is through an accurate diagnosis. The intent of this two-year endeavor has been to develop an automated pathological diagnosis system that implements an AIS-derived algorithm that serves to automatically identify and classify prostate cancer cells using slides extracted from biopsies. The proposed system would use digital image processing techniques to enhance and process cell images gleaned from biopsies and then convert the images to numerical data to be implemented into the algorithm. The system would classify the images while adhering to pathological grading criteria, resulting in a diagnosis of the severity and potential deleteriousness of the cancer.<br><br>

CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING STATIC AND BALLISTIC STRETCHING IN HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER ATHLETES
Nicole Alyce Baird
Episcopal High School Jacksonville, Fl USA

The purpose of this investigation is to study static and ballistic methods of stretching in the hamstrings of soccer athletes and to determine which method is most beneficial to increasing flexibility before activity. Consent forms were given and the study could start when they were returned. Each team was assigned two days where the first day was static and second was ballistic stretching. Each athlete was tested of the flexibility of the hamstring, a stretch (depending on which day) was completed and the flexibility was tested once more. In average static stretching in athletes increased flexibility by 13.5% and ballistic stretching increased by only 8.5%. These numbers show and support the hypothesis that static stretching will increase flexibility more significantly than ballistic stretching in the hamstrings of soccer athletes.

EXPRESSION OF TNF-R1 AND R2 DURING OLIGODENDROGLIA DIFFERENTIATION: A PREREQUISITE FOR TNFA- BASED THERAPY IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Lev A Shaket
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA, USA

The inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFa) plays a dual role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Although the exact roles of the two TNFa receptors are not known, it has generally been held that TNFa signaling through TNFa-Receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces apoptosis in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), whereas TNFa signaling through TNFa–Receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes remyelination and the proliferation of OPCs. If so, then these receptors obviously play a very crucial role in Multiple Sclerosis. Consequently, this study was undertaken to gain a broader understanding of TNFa signaling by characterizing the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 during OPC differentiation, thus providing a foundation for the manipulation of the two receptors in MS therapy. <br><br>The study used the CG4 cell line as an OPC model and tested how the stage of differentiation in CG4 cells affects their expression levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2. It was hypothesized that TNFR1 and R2 would both be expressed in proliferating CG4 cells and differentially regulated during CG4 differentiation.<br><br>Expression levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were determined by RT-PCR and gel electrophoresis analysis and confirmed by a GAPDH internal control. The results supported the hypothesis. It was found that both TNFR1 and TNFR2 were present in proliferating cells and were downregulated during CG4 differentiation. These results are very significant. They facilitate the use of a potential role for TNFa- based therapy in Multiple Sclerosis, now that it is known, for a fact, how the TNFa receptors are expressed in the CG4 cell line.<br><br>

A COMPARISON OF FLOW THROUGH MONOLEAFLET AND BILEAFLET MECHANICAL HEART VALVES UTILIZING IN VITRO DIGITAL PARTICLE IMAGING VELOCIMETRY AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS
Jonathan Adam Birnbaum
John L. Miller Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY, USA

Although Mechanical Heart Valves (MHVs) have lasting durability, their success is still limited due to thromboembolic, or clot inducing, complications. In this study, the leading St. Jude Medical bileaflet MHV was compared with a Medtronic Hall monoleaflet design. A non-invasive in vitro technique, Digital Particle Imaging Velocimetry (DPIV), was utilized to measure two dimensional displacement and velocity vector fields of fluid moving distal to a valve in a recirculation flow loop driven by a peristaltic, or quasi-steady, flow pump. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was also employed in two dimensional geometries of the two valves to theoretically model flow and compare with the DPIV results. Additionally, a novel approach was also pioneered for the DPIV measurements to reconstruct a three dimensional presentation of the flow fields past a valve. The results of the measured flow fields indicate high levels of shear stresses in the bileaflet valve design, generated by the jets during flow passage through the valve's major and minor orifices, indicative of flow areas where platelet activation may occur. The flow field distal to the monoleaflet valve was characterized by a potentially dangerous large recirculation zone. Shear stress history of distinct particle trajectories were computed in both the CFD and DPIV, and were quantified to predict platelet activation levels within hot spot regions in the valve flow fields. The analysis suggests that the monoleaflet valve has an overall lower thromboembolic potential, but the safest valve choice is patient dependent.

MECHANISM OF GLIAL ACTIVATION BY S100B WITH RELEVANCE TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Sehar Sultana Gafoor
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago IL, USA

One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a glial-activated inflammatory response. Glial cells, which play active and vital roles in the central nervous system, when chronically activated, initiate a detrimental neuroinflammatory cycle which results in cell death. S100B is one-such glial-derived protein which is neuroprotective in nanomolar concentrations but neurotoxic in larger. Concentrated S100B appears to stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleuken-1B (IL-1B), and toxic oxidative stress enzymes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The purpose of this experiment was to examine if S100 stimulates the expression of iNOS and IL-1B, and if so, to investigate if the upregulation of iNOS was mediated through IL-1B in rat astrocytes. <br><br> Sprague Dawley neonatal rat cortical astrocytes were pretreated with an IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA) for 15 minutes and then treated with S100B. At 24 hours, cell lysates were prepared and Western Blots performed. The molecular endpoints identified were iNOS, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and IL-1B.<br><br> The results suggest that S100B activates glial cells in vitro, stimulating the expression of IL-1B and iNOS. Also, this study suggests that the glial S100B stimulation of iNOS is mediated through IL-1B; iNOS expression was dose-dependently inhibited by the IL-1RA. These results propose that interleuken-1 could be a possible drug discovery and development target for AD. By blocking IL-1 and thus the neurotoxic actions of S100B, such drugs could potentially delay or prevent the onset of the AD associated degeneration of cognitive abilities as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF METFORMIN'S EFFECT ON BRAIN INSULIN RECEPTORS
Jason Scott Pellegrino
Manhasset High School, Manhasset NY, USA

The type II diabetes drug, metformin, decreases blood sugars in diabetics by increasing insulin-sensitivity and decreasing the glucose production by the liver. Based on Obici’s (2002) correlation between hypothalamus insulin signaling and hepatic glucose production, it was hypothesized that metformin increases insulin-sensitivity and decreases hepatic glucose output by acting on the brain. The design of the experiment was as follows: two variable transgenic mice groups, Group A was transfected with human brain, liver, and pancreas insulin receptor (IR) function, Group B with human liver and pancreas IR function; the positive control (Group C) contained mice with half endogenous IR function; and the negative control (Group D) consisted of non-transgenic mice. Plasma tissue samples provided by a technician were assayed for insulin, glucose, adiponectin, and leptin levels in all four groups at 0, 14, and 28 day time points (significant difference analyzed via ANOVA p<0.05). Male mice from Group A demonstrated a significant decrease in plasma insulin concentration upon exposure to meformin, while the male mice from Group B demonstrated a significant decrease in blood glucose concentration. Adiponectin levels in male mice from Group A increased 198% upon exposure, while male mice from Group B experienced little change. There were significant differences between the measurements of males and females that were believed to be a result of the differences in estrogen metabolism. The decrease in glucose concentration of mice without brain IR function suggests that metformin decreases hepatic glucose production by acting on the liver, and the decrease in insulin concentration of mice with brain IR function suggests that metformin increases insulin-sensitivity by acting on the brain. This targets the brain as a possible outlook in diabetes treatment.

SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF HCV HYPERVARIABLE REGION 1 AND CORRELATION WITH RESPONSE TO COMBINATION THERAPY
Bethany MeKenzie Copperidge
Ridgeway High School, Memphis, TN, USA

The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) consists of 27 amino acids near the N-terminus of the envelope 2 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is highly variable within the quasispecies population circulating in a single patient. HVR1 sequences were examined from circulating quasispecies obtained prior to interferon-a-2b and ribavirin therapy. Can patients who respond to therapy be distinguished from those who did not respond based on HVR1 sequence characteristics? HVR1 sequences from 8 responders and 9 non-responders were compared. HVR1 sequences from the two groups did not show a significant difference in the type or position of charged residues. HVR1 sequences were next analyzed for areas of sequence conservation and variation. Responders had significantly higher areas of variation, and the areas of conserved residues overlapped respectively between the responder and non-responder sequences indicating a structural basis for this region in HVR1. Unique amino acid residues to each group were used to find distinguishable patterns between the two groups. In the HVR1 region of responder group, 151 out of 160 sequences showed unique patterns. In the non-responder group, 143 out of 195 sequences displayed unique patterns. More than one patient within the respective group shared the patterns. Independent generation of the same unique patterns in the viral quasispecies of multiple patients within the same group would strongly support the idea that sequence of HVR1 region plays a role in response to therapy. Sequence of HVR1 and parameters such as viral genotype can be used to predict response to combination therapy.<br><br>

ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES BY REAL-TIME PCR AMPLIFICATION OF CLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY CHAIN GENE REARRANGEMENTS
Anita Mary Kulangara
John Jay High School, Cross River, New York, USA

Lymphoid malignancies are a group of diverse cancers derived from the hematopoietic system. Their morphology can be similar to benign neoplasms and normal reactive conditions, and unequivocal diagnosis often requires identification of clonal cell populations. To this end, a novel methodology, Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was developed to amplify clonal Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) gene rearrangements. Thirty-seven patient samples with unrevealed diagnoses, four leukemia samples, one leukemia cell line, and a negative control were tested. Real-time PCR revealed 18 true-positives and 19 true-negatives. Interestingly, the patient from the 1 false-positive sample was diagnosed with lymphoma 3 years later, indicating the assay could detect cancer much sooner than traditional tests. The 5 false-negatives could reflect that only 70% of lymphoid malignancies harbor clonal IgH rearrangements and other genes may need to be examined. Real-time PCR analysis can rapidly and reliably detect malignant clonal cell populations and be used as a tool to aid in the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies.

DOES THE EXPOSURE OF SPECIFIC DRUM RHYTHMS CAUSE CHANGES IN THE REPRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION RATE OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE?
Daniel James Concho
Barstow High School, Barstow, CA, USA

In previous study, it was proved that when humans experience or hear drumming, they respond with a change in their autonomic nervous system rhythms. This research was to test the effects of rhythm on reproductive rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast cells). It was hypothesized that when the fungi cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are exposed to Native and Modern drum rhythms, they will respond with a change in reproduction and rate of reproduction. Similar to previous study, the reproduction and reproduction rate will react with improved rates.<br><br> Similar music from previous study was used to test the reproductive rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast cells were observed multiplying under normal conditions. A blind study was used to conduct the tests. A statistical analysis was made from the data collected, which showed significance in standard deviations between the three test groups (control, Standard rhythm, Native rhythm). An analysis of variances supported the conclusion.<br><br> The null hypothesis was partially rejected while the stated hypothesis was also partially accepted. Much similar to previous study, the modern group resulted with the most significant results, when comparing numbers. There was a significant increase in the reproduction rate of the yeast cells when exposed to modern drumming. When exposed to Native drumming, the yeast cells resulted in a significant drop (lower than variables of control). This contradicts previous study in that it was not beneficial towards reproduction rate. It is similar, however, that the process was slowed down, just as functions of the autonomic nervous system of human subjects.<br><br>

NATURE'S PHARMACY
Rachelle Jayne Bill
Wingate High School, Ft.Wingate New Mexico, United States

The purpose of this project was to investigate whether topical synthetic or herbal medicines would inhibit bacterial growth more effectively. The effectiveness was determined by the antibiotic effect on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. The medicines were then compared according to their zone of inhibition. The variables included selected herbs, methods of preparing extracts, microbes tested, and type of exposure of microorganisms to the extract (applied to agar surface, heated, etc.). The experimenting would either deny or confirm the hypothesis that the herbal medicine's zone of inhibition would be greater than the western medicine. The first step to conducting the experiment was the making of the Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) using aseptic techniques. The TSA was stored in petri dishes for the later use of bacteria growth. Staphylococcus and E. coli were plated on the prepared TSA. The herbal medicines were prepared from extracts from plants that are used for traditional purposes within the Navajo culture. The synthetic medicines were pre-saturated. Samples of each medicine were placed in the petri dishes plated with the bacteria. A control was made to compare the bacteria growth in each petri dish. The petri dishes were incubated over night at thirty-seven degrees Celsius. Observations were made to measure the zone of inhibition after twenty-four hours of incubation. Several trials were conducted for each bacteria. Results indicated that some herbal remedies were able to kill bacteria as well, if not better, than the synthetic medicines.

THE EFFECT OF IMPAIRED VISION AND COLOR ON PERIPHERAL VISION
Ishani Nitin Choksi
Bishop Feehan High School, Attleboro, MA, USA

This study was to see how the type of vision (impaired or perfect) and color affects the peripheral vision of a person. A perimetry test was administered to 35 people. <br><br> Each person placed his chin on the pre-marked area, with his eyes focused straight ahead. A colored tab was positioned on the stick, and the stick was held at the rightmost 0-degree marking on the board. Next, the subject closed his left eye. While moving the stick towards the 90-degree marking at the center of the board, the subject indicated when the tab was first sighted and when he was first able to identify the tab’s color. The above steps were repeated for each of the 7 colored tabs. The same procedure described above was repeated for the left eye, but the stick was moved from the leftmost 0-degree marking on the board, and the subject closed his right eye.<br><br> In conclusion, it was determined that people with impaired vision (prescription glasses or contact lenses) have less peripheral vision than those with perfect vision (no prescription glasses or contact lenses). In addition, color does not have a significant effect on peripheral vision; however, blue, yellow, and white seemed to be identified more quickly. <br><br> It was observed that there are other effects on peripheral vision, such as age and types of impairment, which could be tested in greater detail if the experiment were repeated. It became apparent that peripheral vision is an alert system for the body and is used in daily activities such as sports and driving. <br><br>

QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI MODULATING CORPUS CALLOSUM SIZE IN THE MOUSE BRAIN
Ning Zhou
Wayzata High School, Plymouth, MN, U.S.A.

The corpus callosum is the brain's primary pathway for interhemispheric communication between the left and right brains, and abnormal function and anatomy of the corpus callosum have been associated with a variety of psychological disorders in humans, including schizophrenia, dyslexia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) modulating corpus callosum size were mapped in 191 BXD recombinant inbred mice and their parent strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J). The midsagittal corpus callosum area was measured using mouse brain sections and stereological techniques. Analysis of the measurements showed midsagittal corpus callosum size to be a heritable trait. A QTL modulating corpus callosum size was identified near the marker S10Gnf071.990 on chromosome 10 at approximately 73 Mb. Two interactive loci were found on chromosomes 1 and 6 (S01Gnf046.600 and D6Mit268, respectively) modulating variation in corpus callosum size. Correlations between corpus callosum size and other behavioral and anatomical phenotypes were also confirmed in the analysis. Overall, the results implicate a strong genetic role in modulation of corpus callosum size. The methods and results of the present study provide the model and groundwork for the process of revealing isolated QTLs and genetic interactions among different loci, which will lead to the creation of a landscape of the genes underlying modulation of corpus callosum size in humans and advance future genetic treatments of disorders associated with the corpus callosum.

EFFECT OF PARATHYROID HORMONE ON TARTRATE-RESISTANT ACID PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY: OSTEOPOROSIS
Cesar Marquez
Lane Technical High School, Chicago and Illinois, United States of America

Osteoporosis is a metabolic, skeletal disorder characterized by the deterioration of bones, causing fractures. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone, whereas osteoclasts resorb (destroy) old bone. Resorption is a process that involves the interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclast progenitors. This experiment determined if a co-culture system using cell lines could be used as a model to test future drugs in the treatment of osteoporosis. It tested different cell ratios and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) concentrations in their efficacy in stimulating osteoclast differentiation in a simulated environment.<br><br> UMR-106 osteoblastic cells were seeded with RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors. PTH was added to each of the wells on the first day. On days three and five, the medium was changed and new PTH was added. The activity of TRAP (marker enzyme for osteoclasts) was measured on day six along with a calculation of the number of TRAP+ multinucleated osteolcasts, which were stained for TRAP. The TRAP activity, in turn, served as an indicator of osteoclastogenesis (osteoclast differentiation). <br><br> Cell concentrations (4000 UMR-106 osteoblasts and 2000 RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitors) were efficient in the stimulation of osteoclast differentiation. The different PTH concentrations (10, 30, and 100 nanomolar) proved to be equally effective in the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, the model was developed and it could be used as a test for potential, antiresorptive drugs in the treatment of osteoporosis.<br><br>

STRUCTURE GUIDED DRUG DESIGN USING VIRTUAL SCREENING TO FIND AN INHIBITOR FOR M. TUBERCULOSIS 6-HYDROXYMETHYL-7,8-DIHYDROPTEROATE SYNTHASE
Kanya Balakrishna
Lausanne Collegiate School, Memphis Tennessee, United States

The purpose of this project was to use virtual screening to find an inhibitor for the enzyme Mycobacterium tuberculosis 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). DHPS is an essential enzyme in M. tuberculosis and is a target for the development of new drugs to combat Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis. The computer modeling was done using the Tripos program Sybyl 6.9 and the M. tuberculosis DHPS crystal structure. First, the binding interactions between DHPS and its pterin substrate were structurally analyzed by examining electrostatic potential, lipophilic potential, and hydrogen bonding patterns. Three Nitrogen atoms, two electron acceptors and one electron donor were then selected from the pterin ligand and a pharmacophore was created to define its distance constraints. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) database was searched for all compounds with similar dimensions. Each compound chosen was docked into the DHPS active site and scored based on compatibility. The top 10% of these scores were analyzed and 40 best matching compounds were selected. 15 of these were obtained from NCI and their Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) for M. smegmatis (an innocuous Mtb model organism) were determined. Results of the microbial testing yielded one compound, with an MIC90 of 1.56 ìg/mL, as a potential inhibitor for M. tuberculosis. Although its mechanism of action is yet unknown, its effectiveness may have been due to the similarity between its hydrogen bonding patterns and those of the pterin ligand. The compound is a new lead in the search for Tuberculosis cures and will continue to be studied in the future.

PERSISTENT INFLAMMATION AND DEEP-SEATED INFECTIONS: IDENTIFICATION OF GENES WITH POTENTIAL FOR A NOVEL TREATMENT OF S. AUREUS INFECTIONS
Shaleen Tarun Cholera
White Station High School, Memphis TN, U.S.A

Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) can cause infections ranging from acne to deep-seated infections such as Meningitis. S. aureus is prevalent in hospitalized patients suffering from exaggerated inflammatory immune responses. This is compounded by the fact that many strains of S.aureus are becoming increasingly multi-drug resistant due to overuse of antibiotics.<br><br> We report the adaptation of S.aureus (isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient suffering from Septic Arthritis) to the micro-milieu created by the soluble mediators of host’s innate immune response. We determined the virulence gene expression (Leukotoxin ED and MSCRAMMs) pattern in S.aureus after growing in presence of graded concentrations of IL-1beta (an inflammatory mediator) and in S.aureus grown within eukaryotic cells. Both of these virulence genes help the bacteria in its invasion process of the human body. Leukotoxins lyse leukocytes, typically neutrophils; MSCRAMMs help bacteria adhere to matrix, the material between cells, so that it may colonize the host faster.<br><br> Our results show that persistent exposure of S.aureus to IL-1beta and the intracellular milieu results in enhanced expression of both Luk ED and MSCRAMMS. In addition, such treatment resulted in the emergence of small colony variants (which are known to be capable of persisting within the host). These results imply that persistent inflammation results in favorable adaptation of S.aureus to the otherwise defensive milieu of the host. With this specific knowledge, a new technique known as “RNA silencing” may potentially be used in the future as a novel treatment for the pathogenesis of S.aureus, taking reliance off of antibiotics.

COGNITIVE DEGENERATION DUE TO EPILEPSY
Max Lawrence Christie
Ossining High School, Ossining NY, USA

Previous research has shown that epileptic activity in the brain can cause impairment in cognitive skills. This study attempted to determine if epileptic activity specific to the neocortex would cause cognitive degeneration. Subjects that experienced an epileptic focus in the neocortex were placed through a series of behavioral tests: an open field test, an elevated plus maze, and a balance beam. Experimental rats showed less purposeful movements, greater anxiety, and worse balance suggesting an impairment of cognitive skills. However the same population moved at greater total velocities (Control, Mean= 97 cm/sec, Experimental, mean=160 cm/sec) than the control rats during the open field testing. Experimental rats also moved for greater ambulatory distances (Control, mean= 84 cm, Experimental, mean=111cm), and greater ambulatory duration (Control, mean= 1.9 sec, Experimental, mean=2.4 sec). This suggests that no hemiparesis is occurring in the neocortex. Because the dysfunction is not motor related the results suggest that epileptic activity in the neocortex may disrupt normal synaptic activity associated with learning causing cognitive impairment. The findings of this research can be used to provide insight into cognitive degeneration caused by epilepsy in people and possibly provide a better understanding of how neocortical epilepsy may disrupt learning and cognition.

THE EFFECTS OF THE RELAXIN HORMONE ON THE LAXITY OF MALE AND FEMALE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TISSUE, IN VITRO
Allison Jaye Landstrom
Southridge High School, Beaverton OR, USA

Females are four times more likely to tear their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than males under the same applied stress. Undetermined as to why, it has been found that female ACL contains receptors for the Relaxin hormone, while male ACL does not, although both genders produce relaxin (Dragoo et. al.). Relaxin is best known for allowing vaginal tissue to stretch during childbirth. It is hypothesized that Relaxin will have a similar effect on the laxity of ACL tissue as it has been shown to have on vaginal tendons/ligaments.<br><br>Porcine tissue and hormone were used as a representational model due to their similarities to human tissue. Achilles tendons were used during phase one of experimentation because of their proximity to the ACL and issues of availability. Both male and female porcine Achilles tendon was extracted, and each piece was cut in half to create matched pairs. Pairings were stretched, using a 248.8002 gram mass, to measure the original laxity. From each matched pair, one sample was exposed to relaxin serum for sixty minutes at 37° C. The other was exposed to lactated Ringer’s solution at 37° C. Pairings were again stretched, post treatment, to measure the resulting laxity. A one sample t-test was conducted comparing the difference in laxity between the relaxin and lactated Ringer’s groups. The male tissue had no significant difference in laxity between solutions, (p-value > 0.15). The change in laxity between the female tissue was significantly different, (p-value < 0.0025).<br><br>

IMMUNOTHERAPY-PROTEIN TRANSDUCTION: A NEW METHOD TO TREAT CANCER.
Sudhanva Raj Govindarajan
Little Rock Central High, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA

Immunotherapy is a new method being investigated to treat cancer. T cells are stimulated by antigen presenting cells (Dendritic Cells) to induce immunity. The presence of free protein in the cytoplasm of the dendritic cells is crucial to be presented on the cell membrane in conjunction with MHC class 1 molecule to stimulate the T cells. Previous methods to achieve this have been either unsuccessful or associated with side effects (e.g. viral vectors).<br><br>The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether attaching a protein transduction domain yields higher protein concentration in the cytoplasm of the dendritic cells compared to usual methods.<br><br>Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were cultured into dendritic cells. Fibroblasts and dendritic cells were incubated with a tumor specific protein (NY-ESO-1) or a protein transduction domain (PTD) attached to the tumor specific protein (PTD-NY-ESO-1). The NY-ESO-1 and PTD-NY-ESO-1 content in the fibroblasts and dendritic cells was determined by western blot analysis. <br><br>PTD-NY-ESO-1 but not NY-ESO-1 was present in the fibroblasts suggesting that attaching PTD to NY-ESO-1 helps the entry of the protein in question through a process other than endocytosis. Both NY-ESO-1 and PTD-NY-ESO-1 were seen in the dendritic cells. The concentration of PTD-NY-ESO-1 in the dendritic cells was higher.<br><br>In conclusion, attaching PTD increases the concentration of NY-ESO-1 in the cytoplasm of the dendritic cells ready to be presented to the T cells. This can be a potential way to increase the concentration of the protein in question in the dendritic cells without severe side effects.<br><br>

SNP DETECTION OF A 410BP REGION OF MTRR PROMOTER IN COLORECTAL ADENOMA PATIENTS
Stephanie Agnes Tse
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA, United States

Studies have shown low folate is associated with colorectal cancer precursor lesion (adenoma) development. The one-carbon cycle is a folate-dependent biochemical process important for DNA synthesis and methylation. Methylation is a process that adds a methyl group to a molecule, ultimately changing its behavior and function. Because it is a folate-dependent cycle, defects in genes that code for respective enzymes involved are believed to affect folate availability. Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is an enzyme responsible for restoring cobalamin activity in this cycle. Defects in the MTRR gene are hypothesized to lower folate availability by affecting its enzyme efficiency. The purpose of this project is to analyze a 410 base pair region of a 1.5 kilobase promoter region for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a single base pair change, in patients with colorectal adenomas. The Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system, a computerized system specialized in mutation/SNP analysis, was used to analyze 45 randomly-selected samples from a previous sigmoidoscopy-based study, but due to inadequate PCR product yield, only 28 samples were continued for SNP detection. Controls were sent to the appropriate technician for direct sequencing. Results indicate that some of the samples did have a particular heterozygous 2479T->C/T SNP in the targeted region. However, there was one case (evident in two samples) that had peak variations indicating a mutation, but peaks were different from the positive control. This suggests problems may occur on a transcriptional level in patients with colorectal adenomas, but the effect of the SNP will be studied in future research.

NOVEL GENETICALLY MODIFIED ADENOVIRAL VECTOR(S) FOR GENE THERAPY OF MESOTHELIOMA
Rahul Ram Goli
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

Purpose: To evaluate novel genetically modified adenoviral vectors for enhanced gene delivery to mesothelioma cancer cells to achieve high therapeutic effect. <br><br>Methods: Mesothelioma cancer cells were grown in 24 well plate. Cells were then infected with genetically modified recombinant adenoviruses Ad5.RGD, Ad5.Pk7 and Ad5.RGD.pK7 (encoding both luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and unmodified virus Ad5. After 24 hrs, enhanced gene delivery to mesothelioma cells by these novel vectors was evaluated by green fluorescent protein expression using fluorescent microscope. Luciferase gene expression was quantified by luciferase assay.<br><br>Results: Genetically modified viruses with targeting ligands incorporated showed increased gene expression compared to non-modified Ad5 virus. Two motifs, RGD and polylysine (pK7), have been shown to enhance adenovirus infection via Coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent pathways when incorporated into adenovirus fiber because, these motifs bind to different cell surface proteins (integrins and heparan sulfate) which are over expressed in cancer cells (RGD motif binds to integrins, and pK7 binds to heparan sulfate-containing receptors). Our results indicate that Ad5.RGD, Ad5.Pk7 and Ad5.RGD.pK7 mediated GFP and or luciferase gene delivery was significantly higher than Ad5.<br><br>Conclusions: Genetically modified viruses with targeting motifs increases infectivity and thereby increases gene delivery to mesothelioma cells. These modified viruses enhances clinical utility for gene therapy<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VITAMIN B COMPLEX ON THE GENERAL WELLNESS OF PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN
Lindsay R. Goodell
St. Clair High School; St. Clair, Michigan 

Purpose: Alternatives to hormone replacement therapy are being explored to reduce the symptoms of perimenopause. This study looks at vitamin B complex as an alternative treatment for perimenopause symptoms and the effects of a daily, oral supplement of the vitamin on the general wellness of perimenopausal women. <br><br><br> Methods: Thirty perimenopausal women were studied for eight weeks. The study was divided into two parts and followed a crossover format. During Part 1, half of the participants were given vitamin B complex tablets, while the remaining half were given placebo tablets. During Part 2, the type of tablet given was reversed. Prior to treatment, after Part 1, and after Part 2, participants completed an SF-12 Health Survey to assess general wellness.<br><br><br> Results: SF-12 Surveys were scored in two components; mental (MC) and physical (PC). The MC mean score of the Survey A (given prior to treatment) was 45.41 with a standard deviation (STDEV) of 11.48. The PC mean score of Survey A was 54.67 with a STDEV of 4.20. The MC mean score of Survey B (given after vitamin course) was 51.21 with a STDEV of 7.67. The PC mean score of Survey B was 54.37 with a STDEV of 3.52. The MC mean score of Survey C (given after placebo course) was 49.02 with a STDEV of 10.19. The PC mean score of Survey C was 53.03 with a STDEV of 4.63.<br><br><br> Conclusion: A daily, oral supplement of vitamin B complex does not significantly increase the general wellness of perimenopausal women.<br><br>

CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF THERAPEUTIC GRADE ESSENTIAL OILS IN MALIGNANT GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS
Carrie Elizabeth Shaw
Mount Tabor High School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor, has a 5-year survival rate of <2%. Because there have been no major advances in the treatment of GBM in over 30 years, it is imperative that new strategies are developed. Thirty one to 84% of cancer patients use complementary therapies. One such therapy, essential oils, are oils extracted from plants using a steam distillation process. This project studied the effects of essential oils on GBM cells.<br><br> <br><br>Using the WST1 cell proliferation assay, the cytotoxic effect of different therapeutic grade essential oils was determined in SNB19 GBM cells. It was hypothesized that these oils would cause a cytotoxic response compared to a non-essential oil control, olive. Cells were treated with various concentrations of oils (0.04 to 40ug/ml). A dose dependent response was observed. IC50 concentrations (amount needed for 50% cell kill) ranged from 0.52 to 8.4 ug/ml. Clove oil was the most cytotoxic. Olive oil was not cytotoxic. To assess if the oils generated single stranded (ss) breaks in DNA, the comet assay was performed. Cells treated for either 30 or 60 minutes showed a time dependent effect. Tail moments, a quantitative measure of ssDNA breaks, ranged from 2.0 to 27.5, while olive did not generate DNA damage.<br><br> <br><br>Future studies will determine other mechanisms of action, effects of essential oils on normal and other types of cancer cells, and effects of the most active oils in animals with cancer.

FETAL HEPATOCYTE APPLICATION IN LIVER BIOREACTORS
Lekha Rani Tummalapalli
Fox Chapel Area High School, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

This project examines the use of fetal hepatocytes versus adult hepatocytes in liver bioreactors for superior efficacy and longevity. Increased efficacy of liver bioreactors would offer a practical, effective alternative to liver transplantation for patients, eliminating the need for major surgery and a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs. The culture of E17 fetal mice liver cells in a bioreactor assembly was monitored for 21 days, after which the bioreactor tissue was paraffin embedded, sectioned, and analyzed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. A heterogeneously differentiated population of cells was indicated by AFP+, CK19+, and c-kit+ cells marking immature or bipotential hepatocytes and hepatic stem cells. Function and metabolism characteristic of adult hepatocytes was maintained as shown by glucose utilization, lactate production, and presence of albumin. Significant proliferation evidenced by PCNA and Ki-19 positive cells, less than 10% TUNEL positive cells, and lack of decline in metabolism suggests a good viability and longevity of inoculated cells. Thus fetal hepatocytes gave rise to a tissue advantageous in its increased resistance to apoptosis, bipotentiality, plasticity, and mixed population of cell types as compared to tissue stemming from adult hepatocytes in liver bioreactors.

CYCLING BACK TO THE ORIGINS: IDENTIFICATION OF TUMOR-SPECIFIC INITIATION-SITES OF DNA REPLICATION IN CANCER CELL LINES
Kota Talla
Centennial Regional High School , Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada

Comparison of initiation of DNA replication in transformed versus normal cells provides a better understanding of the disrupted regulatory mechanisms of this process, leading to malignancy. Studies reveal a 2-10 fold increase in single-strand nuclease sensitive regions in cancer cells suggesting higher activation of initiation. The objective of this project is to map the origin-sites of eukaryotic DNA replication with special reference to a specific internal 20 bp consensus within 36 bp sequence capable of supporting autonomous replication of a plasmid on human chromosome 19 that is hypothesized to be an initiation-site of DNA replication. <br><br>Six distinct regions on a certain human chromosome containing this 20 bp consensus were analyzed for origin activity and potential tumor-specificity. In-situ chromosomal assay was performed using RealTime PCR on nascent DNA isolated from normal (NSF, W138) and malignant cell lines (HeLa, WI38(SV40), PC3, HCT116, LS174T) to determine its relative abundance at the 20mer region and at two distal regions in each cell line.<br><br> Results revealed that the 20 bp consensus sequence is indeed an initiation site for DNA replication, as observed in the mapping of 20mer 2. Overall, it can be concluded that tumor cells have more active origins than normal cells. Results strongly suggest the presence of tumor-activated origins. <br><br>Applications include specifically targeted therapies in cancer and other dysfunctions of replication, and progress in organ regeneration, to name a few.<br><br>

THE FREQUENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE "FLU ZONE" FLU SHOT IN A GROUP OF HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
Kavi Shane Dotson
Parkersburg High School, Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States of America

The purpose of my project was to find correlations between influenza vaccine administration and the appearance of flu-like symptoms in a sample made up of the faculty and staff from six area schools. I developed and distributed a 19-question survey, pertaining to the subject's medical history of the last 6 months. 258 out of the 330 surveys sent out were returned to be analyzed. The data from these surveys was input into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Sorting programs were run on the information to uncover any patterns. I compared the percentages of people who had received a flu shot within the last 6 months with their symptoms influenced, age, gender, occupation, medical history, and health habits. It was found that inverse correlations existed between the appearance of symptoms with daily hand-washing and occupation. No correlations, however, were found between the appearance of symptoms with gender or administration of the influenza vaccine. The "Flu Zone" influenza vaccine was not proved to be effective in preventing flu-like symptoms in this sample population.

OXIDIZED LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) INDUCED ARTERIAL MUSCLE CONTRACTION IS INDEPENDENT OF CALCIUM
Thomas George Pottanat
Castle High School, Newburgh, IN, USA

Type II Diabetes (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) has become an epidemic. Hypertension which is one of the complications of NIDDM is the number one risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In NIDDM, both glucose and cholesterol levels are elevated creating a high oxidizing environment that promotes the formation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL). Interestingly, OX-LDL has been identified as a direct vasoconstrictor and, therefore, could play a role in hypertension associated with NIDDM. However, exactly how OX-LDL causes the vascular smooth muscle to contract is not understood. The purpose of the current study was to determine if OX-LDL contractions are calcium independent.<br><br> Tissue samples of isolated caudal arterial muscle strips from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were stimulated with 200microM OX-LDL in the presence and absence of calcium (zero calcium bath contained EGTA , a calcium chelating agent, and was repeatedly contracted with KCL to dispense inner Ca2+ reserves). Contractile force was measured via a strain gauge force transducer, recorded as a function of time and normalized as a percent of control contractions to high K+. Mean values were compared using Student’s t-test. <br><br> There was no difference between the contractions in response to OX-LDL in zero-calcium and normal calcium Krebs. Thus OX-LDL induced contractions are independent of calcium. Results suggest that a signal transduction pathway that is alternate to the calcium-myosin light chain kinase cascade remains to be elucidated. Understanding the cellular mechanism of OX-LDL induced vasoconstriction will lead to new therapeutic interventions in treating hypertension associated with disorders such as NIDDM.

CONTEXT-DEPENDENT BINDING BY THE MYC ONCOPROTEIN THE CELLULAR BASIS FOR SUSTAINABLE TUMOR REGRESSION
Michael Yu-horng Lin
Saratoga High School, Saratoga, California, USA

Publications have shown that even temporary inactivation of the oncogene c-MYC can induce osteosarcoma tumors to regress. Surprisingly, when MYC is reactivated in these differentiated cells, the oncogene lacks the ability to reinduce tumorigenesis. Once this phenomenon is better understood, oncogene inactivation will hold much promise in the clinic.<br><br> The hypothesis tested here is that the MYC oncoprotein, a transcription factor, binds to target loci differently upon reactivation, depending on cellular context (differentiated or cancerous state), which produces the behavioral change in response to MYC.<br><br> Murine cancer cell lines containing a conditionally regulated MYC transgene were compared across three conditions: “MYC-activated” (MYC on for 48 hours; cancerous); “MYC-inactivated” (MYC off 48 hours; differentiated); and “MYC-reactivated” (MYC off 48, then on 20 hours; differentiated).<br><br> First, a cDNA microarray assay showed global changes in gene expression. Genes were selected for further study by a short, custom-written Perl program that searched for MYC binding loci in promoter regions, as well as confirmation of microarray results by RT-PCR. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed up to 5-fold changes in the binding of MYC to target loci.<br><br> The results suggest that MYC’s inability to reinduce tumorigenesis may stem from compromised regulation of target genes, which in turn may come from a change in MYC’s binding to target loci. Therefore, cellular context affects a cell’s vulnerability to the oncogene through binding and regulation of target genes. Future work will identify factors that affect MYC’s binding and bring oncogene inactivation therapy one step closer to the clinic.

WHAT ARE WE DRINKING?
Kathryn Yarbrough Bray
Maryville High School, Maryville, TN, USA

At Maryville High, students are encouraged to carry clear, plastic drinking bottles which they refill periodically from fountains and faucets. However, when the water bottles are reused, the plastics break down and bacteria contaminate the water. If the bottles are washed, the plastic breaks down faster, allowing more bacteria to flourish. <br><br> My experiment measured the bacteria intake of different brands of plastic water bottles, both single- and multiple-use. I hypothesized that in periods of three days, bacteria colonies would increase by a factor of five, sufficiently high enough to require a boil-water advisory. Five students, including myself, received two bottles each of a different brand, and carried the bottles around school, drinking and refilling regularly. After every period of three days, I swabbed the bottles, transferring the samples to Petri dishes set with agar, and washed one of each set of two bottles. This cycle continued for two weeks; I swabbed the bottles three separate times. The Petri dishes were incubated, and I observed and recorded their contents after four days. <br><br> The bacteria colonies did not grow exponentially, but the bottles I washed contained more bacteria, with a greater variety of shape and color, than the bottles simply reused. This matched my hypothesis and supported the theory that the longer the bottles were reused, the more complex and potentially-harmful bacteria developed. My study illustrates the dangers of reusing single-use water bottles over extended periods of time, and advocates the employ of a sturdier plastic bottle.

La Veta High School, La Veta Colorado, United States

This experiment was designed to test the effect of different brands of toothpaste on streptococcus mutants in vitro. Four different brands of toothpaste, two popular commercial brands which use fluoride as the main active ingredient and two lesser known natural brands which used plant derivatives as their active ingredient,were used. <br><br> The Kirby-Bauer disc sensitivity method was used to determine which toothpaste best inhibits the growth of streptococcus mutants. The streptococcus mutant bacteria was applied to a blood agar dish and incubated for 24 hours. Five petri dishes were streaked with the streptococcus mutants. A solution of reagent saline and .5ml of each toothpaste was made. Blank sterile discs were dipped into each toothpaste solution. They were then placed in the center of the four petri dishes. A blank sterile disk dipped in reagent saline was placed in the center of the 5th dish;this was the control. All samples were incubated for 48 hours. Then the sensitivity zones were measured with a cm ruler. All of the above steps were repeated. <br><br> Results for trial 1 (T1) and trial 2 (T2) sensitivity zones were: Colgate T1=11cm & T2=14cm, Crest T1=18cm & T2=18cm, Jasons T1=19cm & T2=19cm, Spry T1=24cm & T2=24cm, Control T1=0cm & T2=0cm. <br><br> This project demonstrated that Crest, Colgate, Jasons, and Spry toothpaste were all capable of some growth inhibition of streptococcus mutants. The natural toothpaste Spry, whose active ingredient is xylitol, a sugar alcohol, best inhibited the growth of streptococcus mutants.<br><br><br>

Y-CHROMOSOMAL DETECTION OF FOREIGN LYMPHOCYTES RESIDING IN A SUBJECT AFFLICTED WITH LYMPHOMATOID PAPULOSIS
Sam James Howell
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI, USA

The disease Lymphomatoid Papulosis (LyP) is a rare disease of T-lymphocytes for which there is no known cause or cure. I became interested because my sister was diagnosed with LyP after the birth of her third child in October, 2002.<br><br>The idea that the T-lymphocytes were of extraneous origin is the basis for the hypothesis:<br><br>The T-lymphocytes involved in LyP did not originate in the subject's body, but rather in the fetus as fetal stem cells, then transferred to the mother during birth as a model of microchimerism.<br><br>Samples were collected from the subject H, including normal cutaneous cells (S), papular cells (L) and buccal cells from both the subject (H) and a descendant, (R). The DNA was amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR. STR Primer sequences that are located on the y-chromosome (DYS434) were used in the amplification. It was then analyzed using electrophoresis and Labworks3.<br><br>After analyzing the results, I found that the buccal cells (H), the papular cells (L) and the descendant's cells (R) all had y-chromosomal STR presence (MW=119 bp) in all successful PCR amplifications. This shows that in the female subject, there is a presence of male cells, which supports the hypothesis.<br><br>The next step will be to culture the papular cells (L), the benign cells (S) and the cutaneous cells from R. Then, using the HLA typing information on the two subjects, administration of cell-specific antigens would be utilized to rid the in-vitro cultures of cells containing the y-chromosome.<br><br>

MIGRATING THE TABU ASSAY TO A CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS PLATFORM: ACCELERATING THE SEARCH FOR CANCER TREATMENTS
Herbert Mason Hedberg
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro MA, United States

The telomerase enzyme promotes uncontrolled cell division in 80% of all cancers. Telomerase inhibitors are specific and potent tumor suppressors that induce apoptosis (cell death) only in cancer cells. The goal of this study is to produce a method that can rapidly screen a library of natural product extracts to identify telomerase inhibitors, potential small molecule cancer therapies without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. <br><br>Last year, this researcher developed the Telomerase Activity by UV (TABU) assay. TABU utilizes a novel dialysis technique that allows reaction kinetics quantification without interfering with the reaction. However, this assay is meticulous and unsuitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) procedures.<br><br>This year the TABU assay was migrated to capillary electrophoresis, a platform used by drug screening companies to perform fast, low volume analyses. Two methods of CE suitable for telomerase activity analysis were conceived: UV absorbance and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). The UV method allows for rapid, inexpensive library screening. The LIF method detects a fluorescently labeled primer molecule which provides high sensitivity to not only identify inhibitors but to also suggest their method-of-action.<br><br>These protocols were proven using simulations of the mechanisms occurring during telomerase reactions. In vitro gene expression was used to synthesize the human telomerase enzyme from cDNA clones. Activity of the synthesized telomerase was demonstrated and the LIF assay method was performed. This capillary electrophoresis telomerase assay could screen thousands of natural compound mixtures per week to detect potent telomerase inhibitor molecules: potential novel cancer medications.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF LYCOPENE ON TISSUE DEVELOPMENT OF DUGESIA TIGRINA
Julia Caroline Baltz
Westview High School, Martin, Tennessee, United States of America

<br><br>The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of Lycopene on the tissues of Dugesia tigrina. This will be done by studying the effect on tissues during regeneration. <br><br>The hypothesis is Lycopene will influence tissue development during the process of regeneration. <br><br> Feeding: Each Dugesia tigrina or planarian is fed one milligram of cooked egg yolk. After 47 minutes each planarian is removed from its petri dish. Each petri dish is cleaned and 7 milliliters of spring water are poured in the dish with the planarian. <br><br>Testing: Lycopene is distributed by either a pill/powder solution or a tomato solution. Pill/powder solution: The multivitamin pill containing Lycopene is crushed. Lycopene, ranging from 1 to 7 milligrams, is dissolved in 4 milliliters of spring water, and 2cc’s of the solution is distributed into each dish. Tomato solution: Roma tomatoes, ranging from 15.07 grams to 17.04 grams, are blended with various amounts of spring water and then 2 cc’s of the solution are distributed to each planarian. <br><br> Since the discovery of the effects of Lycopene on some Italian men with prostate cancer, many scientists have been thrilled with results from their experiments. The use of Lycopene can greatly affect cells in the body. Cancer weakens and damages tissues; Lycopene strengthens and repairs tissues. This discovery may influence more people to consider taking Lycopene to ward off cancer or help treat it if it is diagnosed. Promotion of healthier cells and tissues might also be a reason for taking vitamins with Lycopene. <br><br>

A NOVEL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING PUTATIVE AGING GENES WITH COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
Nicholas Paul Semenkovich
Ladue Horton Watkins High School, Ladue Missouri, USA

Preventing or delaying aging would profoundly improve the quality of life in western society. Although we have been able to extend human lifespan by many years, we have yet to determine what causes aging. New efforts in genomic sequencing may have brought us one step closer to that goal. Research on worms, mice and other animals has uncovered genomic regions that, when inactivated or overexpressed, may double or even triple the lifespan of an organism. However, there is no coherent strategy for using these disparate sequences to identify homologous regions in the human genome. To test the hypothesis that computer programs can predict putative aging genes by comparing sequenced genomes, I used the BLAST tool in conjunction with thousands of lines of my own PERL code running under the Redhat Linux 9.0 operating system to compare aging-associated sequences from model organisms to the human genome. Using available genome and aging gene databases, I developed a novel protocol to determine the locations of aging genes in multiple organisms and then locate similar aging genes in humans. These data were compared to known metabolic pathways and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine their potential impact on aging. These studies provide proof of concept that bioinformatics can help bridge the gap between descriptive data from the human genome and clinically relevant issues such as aging.

NOVEL NONPEPTIDE INHIBITORS OF CASPASE-3 FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
YunXiang Chu
Ladue Horton Watkins High School, St. Louis, MO, USA

Caspase-3 is a cysteinyl protease that triggers apoptotic cell death. It has been identified as a critical component in apoptosis in neurons. Its inhibition may have an important impact in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer¡¯s, Parkinson¡¯s, and Huntington¡¯s diseases. Interest in caspase-3 as a therapeutic target has led many researchers to pursue the development of inhibitors. The design, synthesis, and in vitro activities of a series of potent small-nonpeptide molecule inhibitors of caspase-3 were developed. Compound 3 was a modest inhibitor of caspase 3 (IC50=122.5 nM). The methylation of isatin nitrogen to give compound 10 (IC50=39.0 nM) resulted in an improvement in activity relative to its precursor 3. N-alkylation with a larger hydrophobic group, compounds 4 (13.9 nM) and 13 (13.3 nM), resulted in a ten-fold increase in activity. The most active compounds come from alkylation with a substituted aromatic ring containing an electron-donating group in the paraposition (11, 7.2 nM and 12, 7.3 nM). These compounds may be useful in the prevention of apoptosis in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders.

WILL BENZALDEHYDE AS AN ACTIVE COMPONENT OF CEDRELLA ORDORATA ACT AS A CONTRACEPTIVE IN MUS MUSCULUS?
Megan Nichole Griffin
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, MO, United States

In South America, many trees and plants are used for several medicinal purposes. Cedrella ordorata, Spanish Cedar, is used by the Mayan women to cure many ills. The most unusual is the use of Cedrella ordorata as a contraceptive. The women take the tea three times a day for three days to cause sterility for one cycle. Still, since testing has not been done to determine whether or not the tea actually works, the success rate is not known. To test the tea's effectiveness, Mus musculus was used because they breed year round. The tea was administered one does (.02 ml) three times a day for three days. Each mouse was in a separate cage to prevent mating before the tea was fully administered. Each mouse was fed and watered daily ad libium and there were frequent liter changes. Each mouse was given three days after administration to allow the tea to take full affect. The mice were observed for any possible side effects. Then, one male mouse was paired with one female. A female comes into heat every 4-5 days, so the pair was give a week to breed. To make sure the mice were breeding, they were checked daily and females were examined for a mucus membrane that develops after mating. After a week, the male mice were removed and the females were observed for a vaginal plug. In conclusion, all control mice had litters of healthy pups, while none of the test mice had any litters. Therefore, it appears Cedrella ordorata is effective.

UVR INDUCE DNA DAMAGE: HOW CRITICAL IS THE OZONE LAYER?
Marla Maxine Valentine
Murphy High School, Mobile, Alabama, USA

UVR is a leading cause of squamous skin cell carcinoma; the second leading form of skin cancer in the United States. Several wavelengths of UVR, mainly UVC, are filtered by the ozone layer. It is hypothesized that without the ozone layer acting as a protective barrier, the danger of DNA damage due to prolonged exposure to UVR will dramatically increase. By viewing damage to squamous epithelial caused by prolonged exposure to UVR, with and without a simulated layer of ozone, length of safe exposure time can be determined. A comet assay is used to quantify DNA damage, in this low cell count experiment. This is performed using materials found in a basic lab setting; including, ethidium bromide, NaCl, Triton-X, Tris, agarose, phosphate buffered saline, electrophoresis apparatus, and a UV emitting light source. An Olympic flourescent microscope was used to visualize DNA damage. Damage is quantified by several measurements of the comet tail, which is composed of broken strands of DNA.

KUKAEPUA'A: THE ANTI-INFLAMMAROTY PROPERTIES OF DIGITARIA CILIARIS PHASE 3: TARGETING PROTEIN KINASE-C DEPENDENT PROCESSES
Amanda M. Garcia
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI USA

Kukaepua’a (Digitaria ciliaris) is used in traditional Hawaiian medicine as a treatment for the pain associated with gout. In previous research, extracts prepared from the leaves of freshly picked kukaepua‘a were capable of inhibiting TPA-induced inflammation. Using in vitro models, treatment with TPA or LPS resulted in a complete disaggregation of the microfilament bundles in mouse fibroblasts and of the subcortical filaments in macrophages. Treatment with the crude extract or the active fraction either before or after TPA and LPS significantly inhibited the ability of TPA to induce microfilament disorganization in fibroblasts. In contrast, treatment with the crude extract or the active fraction significantly inhibited the ability of LPS only to induce subcortical filament depolymerization in macrophages. These data indicate that the anti-inflammatory agent in extracts of kukapua'a probably modulates the activity of protein kinase C (PKc), the receptor for TPA and activated by LPS treatment. It is hypothesized that the active fraction is not capable of inhibiting TPA-induced depolymerization of cytoskeletal elements in macrophages because these cells may contain variant isoforms of PKc. Acetaminophen, a known anti-inflammatory agent that works at the level of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, was incapable of inhibiting TPA-induced cytoskeletal disorganization. Mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that the active fraction of D. ciliaris may be squalane. However, confirmatory tests revealed that commercial squalane preparations are incapable of inhibiting TPA-induced cytoskeletal disorganization. Therefore, it can be concluded that the active fraction is not squalane and could be a geometric isomer of squalane.

GENETIC CAUSES OF HEARING LOSS
Rachel Choi
Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

The purpose of this research is to investigate the genetic causes of hearing loss in the pediatric population. Connexin 26 is a small gene that is known to cause hearing loss when mutated. Connexin 26 acts in a recessive manner, requiring both copies of the gene to be mutated to cause hearing loss. Clinically, only the coding region of the Connexin 26 gene is screened for mutations. In 50% of the Connexin 26 mutation positive children, both copies of the gene are found to be mutated, but in the other 50% only one mutated copy of the gene is found. Since mutations in both copies of the Connexin 26 gene are required to cause hearing loss, the question is, where is the second mutation in the 50% of children with hearing loss and one Connexin 26 mutation? We hypothesized that in the 50% of cases where only one copy of the changed gene is found, the other change may be in a region that is not clinically screened. To test this hypothesis, regions of the gene that are excluded from clinical analysis (i.e. the promoter region) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced to identify mutations. <br><br> As a result of screening the promoter region we have found potential mutations including several single nucleotide changes as well as a large deletion. Investigations are ongoing to determine the effect that these promoter changes have on the function of the Connexin 26 gene. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

STEM CELL PROTEOMIC AND GENOMIC SIGNATURES FROM A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE MUTATION THAT PREDISPOSES TO COLON CANCER
Mazell Tetruashvily
Cherokee High School, Marlton NJ, USA

Colon cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States. The cellular mechanisms are not fully understood but it is believed that colonic stem cells are involved. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate fractionated colonic stem cells obtained from a Familial Adenomatosis Polyposis (FAP) patient by observing the changes they undergo during colon cancer development. This is accomplished by proteomic and genomic analysis of the layers of a colon crypt, two dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, cDNA microarray, and computer imaging. From the first stage of experiments, over 600 proteins were identified in the three-pH ranges 4-7, 5-8, and 6-11. Of those proteins, two potentially significant protein differences between the colon crypts of an FAP patient and that of a normal patient have been identified: Gluthione S-Transferase (GST) and beta catenin. This study also concludes that the colon crypt of FAP patients differs largely in protein composition from the colon crypt of normal patients. <br><br> Stage two of the experiment involved observing the gene expression in the layers of the colon crypt. The data obtained highlighted the vertical differences observed in the gene composition of an FAP patient. Differences were also observed in the gene composition in horizontal comparisons between FAP tissue and normal tisse. As the cell maturation process of the colon crypt proceeds in both tissues, genes were observed to fluctuate in magnitude. <br><br> Currently, histology is being completed to verify the identification of protein markers established in stage one. Then, utilizing a technique called cluster analysis, stage three of the project will determine the pathway of a gene’s level of expression to understand the context of FAP patient status.<br><br>

DETERMINATION OF THE EMBRYOGENESIS OF OAVS
Lisa Marie Saccomano
Cherry Creek High School, Englewood CO, USA

<br><br> OAVS, a congenital birth defect, affects an estimated 1 in 5600 live births. The clinical manifestations, although primarily craniofacial, are multisystemic. The exact etiology of this syndrome is unknown, but is proposed to be the malfunction of some cell-to-cell adhesion mechanisms (i.e. N-CAM or L-CAM) in the primordial embryonic inner ear (the otic vesicle) leading to ectodermal nondisjunction. <br><br> In order to phenocopy and study OAVS with the chick model, a micro-controlled release of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) was concentrated into the otic vesicle of correctly staged chick embryos. RA is a known teratogen that causes OAVS in human and rat embryos. The morphological development of the ear, as well as of the entire embryo, was monitored with light and electron microscopy. <br><br> Data statistically support the presumed role of the primordial ear in producing OAVS's anomalies. The first and second branchial arches are structures that differentiate into the primary systems affected in cases of OAVS, specifically those of the head and neck. Hypoplastic branchial arches developed in retinoic acid treated embryos but not in control embryos. Also, distinct deformities were present in the continuing formation of the inner ear. Scanning electron microscopy indicates residual extracellular matrix fibers (connections mediated by cell adhesion mechanisms) between the surface ectoderm and otic vesicle, indicating ectodermal nondisjunction as the proposed model predicts. Therefore, the proposed model draws considerable support from these data. <br><br> Ramifications of a sound model for the embryogenesis of this birth defect include better means of both prevention and treatment.<br><br>

A SIMPLE DIAGNOSE METHOD THROUGH BSE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS
Jae-Won Na
Po-Sung High School Seoul Korea

The subject of my project is "A simple diagnose method through BSE symtoms". It is for livestock industrialists to test livestock in suspicion of BSE themselves before contacting specialists, to lower danger rates.<br><br>(To prevent BSE infected meat being supplyed because it did not go through full, professional diagnosis.)<br><br> <br><br>The original motif was that BSE infected cows secrete clear saliva, while healthy cows produced white, opaque saliva. I presumed that this happens because the cow, like a child, cannot control it's saliva producing system, due to the brain spongifiction by BSE.<br><br>However, I learned that cows have a rudimentary stomach and that the loss of control of the saliva glands over produces saliva, causing the pH of the cows stomach environment from weak acid or neutral, to base properties. This causes microorganisms, which breaks down sugar and starch, to stop any activities. <br><br>Therefore, the cows rudiments will have a higher level of indigested starch and sugar.<br><br>There are many research results indicating that low saliva secretion acidifies the cows stomach, but I have found none that says what too much saliva will do to the stomach.<br><br> <br><br>I indirectly experimented(with the help from a university professor in my country) with cows by giving them the same feed, with differences in moisture level. Consuming the dryer feed, the cow produced more saliva, which caused it's stomach environment to change to base properties. Hence, the more saliva the cow produces, the more basified the stomach substances become. Therefore, BSE infected cows can be segregated through simple diagnosis, before contacting professional medical specialists.

THE EFFECTS OF ETHYLBENZENE ON THE SPERM MOTILITY OF SEA URCHINS.
Melissa Kimberly Morrow , NA
North Toole County High School (Sunburst), Sunburst, MT, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ethylbenzene on the sperm motility in sea urchins. Ethylbenzene is a hydrocarbon plasticizer used in many industrial processes. It was hypothesized that ethylbenzene would effect the sperm motility. Fifteen sea urchins were injected with Potassium chloride to induce spawning. Once gametes were released, only sperm was collected and the eggs were discarded. In three control group test tubes, only sperm was added to salt water. In three other test tubes, concentrations of ethylbenzene at .25, .5, and 1 part per million were added to the collected sperm respectively. The sperm was then observed under a phase microscope using a dark field, at one minute and also after fifteen minutes. A sperm count was conducted at these time intervals and using a standard sperm motility chart, rates were inferred. The sperm slowed down and eventually stopped moving, in all the groups tested at 1 part per million. It was concluded that sperm motility at high concentrations of ethylbenzene, specifically at 1 part per million, was hindered. Other test concentrations of ethylbenzene showed no significant effect on the sperm.

DO SPONGES PRODUCE CHEMICALS TO KILL CANCER CELLS?
Keriann Michelle Liberatore, Jordan Spaw
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce Florida, United States

This project was performed to find out if sponge extracts that were toxic to brine shrimp, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis would also inhibit sea urchin embryos from dividing. We conducted this project as a two year continuation. Some studies have been done on this topic before and we wanted to further our understanding and elaborate on the research from the past.<br><br> We obtained six sea urchins from the institution, spawned them, and let the eggs be fertilized by the sperm. Next, we dispensed the fertilized eggs into multi-well dishes that had 10 micro liters of each extract in each of the twenty-one wells. Then we monitored the development of the fertilized egg underneath a microscope, and counted the number of cells not divided over the total number of cells in view. This gave us our average percent inhibition of cleavage.<br><br> In conclusion, we discovered that marine sponges do produce chemicals that will prevent cells from dividing. Although all of our extracts showed some inhibition of cell division, we considered only those extracts with greater that 60% inhibition as active. There were six sponges that met this criteria, among the most active extracts, Ptiliocaulis walpersi was also the most active extract in our previous study of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity.

USING DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND TECHNIQUE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DEEP-VEIN THROMBOSIS FORMATION DURING PERIODS OF PROLONGED SITTING.

Redeemer Baptist School, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia

Duplex ultrasound technology is the preferred method for the detection of a Deep-Vein Thrombosis. This non-invasive technique combines ultrasonography with a Doppler flow study to locate venous blockages. By controlling the plethora of variables associated with ultrasound technology, this study is the first of its type in the world to adapt this imaging device into a powerful quantitative analysis tool that could significantly reduce the risk of DVT formation during periods of prolonged sitting.<br><br>Twenty-one subjects, in the low-risk DVT category, sat still for 90 minute periods over three consecutive weeks to determine their baseline venous flow levels. A hand-held Sonosite 180 Plus ultrasound machine was used to examine blood flow through the popliteal vein, with blood velocities dropping by an average 30.1% during the first hour. Although literature does not differentiate between sitting still and sleeping, venous blood velocities dropped by a further 20.3% for subjects who fell asleep during testing, highlighting the fact that even healthy people could develop blood clots as flow rates approach venous stasis.<br><br>Over subsequent weeks, subjects performed exercises recommended by the major airlines and a variety of simpler exercises to determine the most beneficial method for maintaining venous blood flow. The airline exercises proved insufficient and foot pumping against a resistant force for 30 second durations at 20 minute intervals maintained blood velocities around original levels. The Jet Gym II has been designed to replicate this exercise regimen, with venous blood velocities actually increasing by close to 20% during the first hour.

COMPARING THREE VIRAL VECTORS IN CHONROCYTES AND SYNOVIOCYTES
Amanda Maria Russo, Ciara Ann Barr
Fox Lane High School, Bedford NY, USA

Arthritis is a degenerative disease which results in the painful inflammation of a joint. Viral vectors can be used to mediate the over-expression of genes encoding for beneficial proteins. The purpose of the experiment was to discover which type of viral vector is most beneficial to gene therapy in arthritis. Three viruses were used; adenovirus (Ad), self-complimentary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) and wild-type adeno-associated virus (AAV). These three viruses were encoded for Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) or Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Protein (IRAP). The viruses were then used to infect chondrocytes and synoviocytes. It was seen that Ad produced more IRAP and peaked earlier than both the scAAV and AAV. The scAAV had an earlier peak in gene expression than AAV as predicted in the hypothesis. The experiment is beneficial to both arthritis research and gene therapy in general.<br><br>

CHEMOSENSE PROFILE: NEW APPROACH FOR ASSOCIATING NORMOSMIA WITH INHERITED AND INJURY BLINDNESS
Ana Cristina Guzmán-Matos, Mariseli Fuentes-Cortés
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, Miramar, P.R.

Investigators have linked the visual development in primates to a decline in the sensory system of olfaction. They reported in their studies that as primates develop their sense of vision their olfactory chemosense declines (Science News, Visionary Research; October 11, 2003; vol.164). Thus, the purpose of this epidemiological case-control study was to establish an association between normosmia and injury or inherited blindness. The data was collected using a questionnaire for the evaluation of the medical history, exclusion of confounders, and socio-demographic profile of the participants. The questionnaire was designed and adapted by recommendation of the teacher and sponsor in the scientific research class. The questionnaire was administered to forty (40) volunteers to determine its reliability and validity. The validated questionnaire and a Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test was administered to blind and sighted volunteers to remove the confounders of the study. The case and control sample population was selected from the Metropolitan Areas of San Juan to participate in the study. The variables were analyzed using Chi-Square analysis in the Epi-Info 6 program to determine an association (p-value >.10). An association between normosmia with injury and inherited blindness was not found in the sample population in the perception of the eleven common odors. The questionnaire used in the investigation may help in the diagnosis of patients that suffer from any olfactory disorder, helping to identify the causes of olfactory loss in patients.<br><br>

Century High School, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America

It is the intention of this study to determine if STI-571 can prevent radiation induced pnuemonitis in C57BL/6 mice.<br><br> It is hypothesized that STI-571 will indeed prevent this radiation induced pnuemonitis in the C57BL/6 mice.<br><br> A lab technician affiliated with the research institution where this project was conducted obtained sixty mice, and these mice were randomly divided into four groups. Two groups were given 12 Gy of radiation by a qualified scientist, and the other two were given sham radiation. After irradiation, two groups of mice, one irradiated and one not irradiated, were treated with STI-571 for six weeks. The other two groups were treated with placebo. After treatment, one-third of the mice were removed from testing. Tests were preformed on them to determine the condition of their lungs. The remaining mice were observed for ten weeks, and then, another third was removed. The final third was removed thirty weeks after the radiation treatment. After the thirty weeks, all the data was compiled and analyzed. This included Plethysmography readings, a Hydroxyproline assay, and the masses of the mice.<br><br> The data showed that the irradiated mice that received STI-571 exhibited signs of healthier lungs than the mice that received the placebo. These results supported the initial hypothesis. Therefore, it can be concluded that STI-571 is an effective method of preventing early-stage pnuemonitis in irradiated lung tissue.<br><br>

REASONS NOT TO WORM OUT OF YOUR VITAMINS
Tracy R. Haan, Kristen L. Letcher
Central High School, Aberdeen, SD, United States

In this experiment, we are testing the effects different vitamins have on the regeneration process of planeria. We obtained six water-soluble vitamins including Vitamin C, Vitamin B-1, Vitamin B-6, Vitamin B-12, Folic Acid, and Niacin. We took twenty-eight planaria, fourteen brown and fourteen black, and cut them transversly. Four planaria, two brown and two black, pieces were put into each of the fourteen containers. The heads were put in the container labeled heads and the tails were put in the containers labeled tails.<br><br>We made vitamin solutions and put one milliliter of each solution into the water of the container labeled for that specific vitamin. We looked at the planaria under the microscope each day making notes as we went along. The onset of the four points of regeneration were recorded. The four points of regeneration inlude 1. White tissue appears 2. Auricles begin to develop 3. Eyespots become visible 4. Full blackish color is reached. We concluded that the only vitamin that had a significant impact on the regeneration rate was Vitamin C.

THE ELABORATION OF A NATURAL ANTACID WITH AN IMPROVED EFFECTIVENESS OVER THE COMMERCIAL ANTACIDS
Sheila Bernice Hernandez, Miguel Alberto Ortiz
Carmen Belen Veiga High School, Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico

In this research project a natural antacid was elaborated with an enhanced effectiveness over the commercial antacids. The antacid ingredients were Fragaria vesca (wild berry), Ananas sativus (pineapple) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg (OH)2). These plants contain great curative properties from bromelaine enzyme and tannins, and therefore will help to prevent conditions of the digestive system besides their antacid properties. <br><br>Antacids neutralize gastric acidity, resulting in an increase in the pH of the stomach. This antacid was made with the extracts of the plants leaves and fruits, and the magnesium hydroxide as a buffer. The effectiveness of the antacid was measured through the pH and viscosity tests. In the pH test the antacid was tested in hydrochloric acid to demonstrate the neutralizing properties of the it. The viscosity test was made by measuring the fluidity of the antacid.<br><br>In this research a natural antacid that neutralized the hydrochloric acid to a pH of 9.71 was produced. The antacid was the best at both tests when compared with commercial antacids. In a future research this natural antacid will be tested on bacteria of the digestive system.<br><br>

CAN TUMORS INFLUENCE THE HOST'S SERUM ALBUMIN AND MAKE IT IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE?
Will Amado Green, Michael Anderson
Rio Rico High School, Rio Rico, AZ, USA

It is known that tumors can cause systemic immunosuppression. We set out to determine whether or not blood/serum components from animals with tumors could contribute to systemic immunosuppression throughout the host subject. Our hypothesis was that increasing tumor burden would lead to increased immune suppression. Serum was separated, and albumin was enriched from it. Spleens were harvested, minced and made to single cell suspensions for testing lymphocyte responses to stimulation. Splenocytes (spleen cells) from tumor-bearing mice did indeed show progressively more inhibition (lack of proliferation), as expected. Splenocytes from normal mice stimulated to proliferate in the presence of albumin from tumor-bearing mice also showed inhibited proliferation. However, the correlation between serum albumin from tumor-bearing mice and reduced splenocyte proliferation was not as direct as we predicted. In effect, serum enriched for albumin from mice with smaller tumors was more suppressive than the same proteins from mice with the largest tumors. Although not entirely conclusive, these preliminary results indicated that our hypothesis was partly true. We conclude that further testing is needed to substantiate our results and further refine our hypothesis about the relationship between tumor burden and immunosuppression.

"ERGONOMIC PROTOYPE A&L": AN ALTERNATIVE TO ALLEVIATE THE SYMPTOMS OF POOR CIRCULATION IN LEGS AND FEET.
Lisaida Andino, Aidalis Andino
Ramon Quinones Medina High School, Yabucoa P.R. 00767

This project investigates the design and testing of the effectiveness of the “Ergonomic Prototype A & L” to alleviate the symptoms of poor arterial and venous circulation in persons older than 40 years. It is an electronic device that produces vibrations and is adapted to a pair of sandals that the patient wears. It was designed, built and tested under the guidance of an electronic technician and a podiatrist.<br><br> Forty persons with the medically diagnosed condition of poor leg circulation and who were not taking medications for this condition were selected. A questionnaire was made and administered to each person to make an initial evaluation of each subject’s symptoms. The participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group with each group as similar as possible for age and sex. Observations were made for pain, swelling, cramps, sensation of heat or cold, heaviness, weakness and inflammation.<br><br> The persons in the control group wore the pair of sandals but the electronic device was not activated. They were observed for five days. The persons in the experimental group wore the activated pair of sandals for twenty minutes per day. They were treated for five consecutive days.<br><br> The control group showed the same symptoms that they had before the experiment. The experimental group showed reductions, that ranged from 50% to 85%, in the seven symptoms observed.<br><br> The conclusion was that the “Ergonomic Prototype A & L” is very effective in reducing the symptoms caused by poor leg circulation in older persons.<br><br>

VACCINATIONS: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW?
Nicholas Joseph Giacalone, Emilie Catherine Orians
Upper Sandusky High School, Upper Sandusky, OH 43351

The goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of vaccinations, their effectiveness, the potential hazards, and the general population's feelings and opinions, with a special focus on the widespread 2003 influenza. Vaccinations have been used for over 200 years, yet many people know little or nothing concerning the safety and effectiveness of these medications. The purpose of this research and analysis is to research what products can be found in vaccines, how effective they have proved to be in past years, and their overall safety. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the general public surveyed will be uneducated concerning vaccines, due to the common idea and belief that immunization is necessary and healthy. The experiment was approached by creating a general survey that was circulated throughout Wyandot County. The survey consisted of general questions concerning how the person felt about vaccines, if the person had been vaccinated with the Fluzone flu shot before or during the epidemic of 2003, and how safe they believed vaccines were. Afterwards, the surveys were analyzed and the data was recorded respectively. It was concluded that our hypothesis concerning the uneducatedness of the general public was correct. Most of the public scored 50% or less on the knowledge portion of the survey. The surveys also showed that most of the participants were vaccinated and believed that the vaccinations were safe. This data and research is significant to society because it shows that the public, though they feel educated and prepared for vaccines, knows very little about what they are putting into their bodies as well as the bodies of their children. It also shows that the government, because they make the vaccinations mandatory, has a duty to better educate the public.

The experiment began January the tenth through twenty eight. Our toner is comprised of boiled rosehips, water, and witch hazel. Our facial cream is comprised of plain yogurt, and fresh cucumbers, blended until smooth. We bought a popular facial toner, and facial cream from a grocery store pharmaceutical. Our variables are Eucrin lotion, and water. A small drop of food coloring was added to each vila, and jar. The colors were used as reminders as to help us remember who received the pharmaceutical cream, and toner, who received the toner, and creame made by us, and who received the variable. Pieces of colored paper were placed into a bag, and our test subjects randomly chose a slip of paper. He, or she was required to use whatever medication "attached" to the color paper he, or she selected.<br><br>We were hesitant about the effectiveness of our cream in comparison with the store bought cream, but we were confident of our toner. the people chosen as variables used their given toner, and cream for two weeks. They kept journals, as did we. They recorded their feelings about their treatment, and its effectiveness.<br><br>At the end of the two weeks, our results were superb. Our cream, and toner siginificantly hydrated, and cleard variable A's epidermis. The store bought toner, and cream worked, but dried the epidermis of variable B. The water, and lotion hydrated variable C's epidermis, but no other siginificant change was noticed.<br><br>We proved that quality and quantity are not interchangeable words.

GAP JUNCTIONS AND GABAERGIC INTERACTIONS IN INSPIRATORY- PHASE FAST OSCILLATORY RHYTHMS
Samuel John, Alexander N. Slade
Plainview Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School 

This project focused on the role of GABAA-mediated synaptic inhibition in the generation of fast oscillatory rhythms in the inspiratory neural control system. In addition, this project examined whether connexin36 (Cx36) is expressed in GABAergic neurons in respiratory-related brainstem regions since recent observations have implicated gap junction coupling mediated by Cx36 among GABAergic neurons as playing an important role in the generation of fast oscillations in the central nervous system (CNS). <br><br>Spectral analyses were performed on inspiratory bursts recorded from the phrenic nerve to identify the presence of fast oscillatory rhythms. We found that blockade of GABAA receptors by bicuculline methiodide altered fast oscillatory rhythms in phrenic nerve discharge, such that the power of the Medium Frequency Oscillations (MFO) was markedly increased and the power of the High Frequency Oscillations (HFO) was significantly decreased. <br><br>Immunohistochemical analyses were used to localize Cx36 and GABAergic neurons within respiratory-related brainstem regions. We found that both Cx36 and GABA were expressed in neurons in respiratory- related brainstem regions, and that some of the GABAergic neurons expressed Cx36.<br><br>These findings demonstrate that synchronized firing among medullary inspiratory neurons (which generate the HFO) and phrenic motoneurons (which generate the MFO) is differentially affected by GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition. These findings also suggest a potential role for gap junctions composed of Cx36 in GABAergic neurons in the generation of fast oscillatory rhythms, which provide an index for inspiratory-phase short time scale synchronization.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF POROUS HYALURONAN SCAFFOLDS FOR WOUND HEALING APPLICATIONS
Ezra Katz, Eric Mansfield
Mesivta Ateres Yaakov Of Greater Long Island, Hewlett, New York, U.S.A 

Biomaterials that facilitate and support cell migration and proliferation must have a degree of porosity, which would allow these cell movements to occur. Therefore, in order for a cross-linked insoluble Hyaluronic acid matrix to be a viable method for allowing the migration and proliferation, it must be porous. Additionally, once porosity has been obtained the hydrogel will be able to help in the treatment of chronic wounds and will be able to sustain the creation of new tissue.<br><br> Three different methods for the creation of a porous hydrogels were investigated. Using lyophilization and template induced porosity we were able to create macroscopic pores. However, while using phase separation we were able to create microscopic porous that were around 1 micron in size. Also this method allows for greater control over microscopic pore sizes whereas the other methods the pores were only able to be controlled on a macroscopic level.<br><br>

THE IN VITRO INHIBITION OF HUMAN NEUTROPHIL ELASTASE BY URSOLIC ACID IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
Storm Michael Liebling, Dustin Liebling, Kevin Zarrabi
Smithtown High School, Smithtown, New York, USA

Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease, usually develops during the early childhood. This lethal disease is characterized by chronic respiratory infections and chronic inflammation, along with blocked airway passages, due to the production of abnormally viscous mucus by the affected glands. The viscosity of the mucous is increased by the presence of DNA that is released from dead cells. This mucus also contains large numbers of neutrophils, which are part of the inflammatory response. The chronic presence of neutrophils is associated with net destruction of lung tissue. Neutrophils produce elastase, a powerful proteolytic enzyme that degrades the elastin component of ECM in the lung. Elastase exists in two forms, free in the extracellular milieu and also bound to the surface of the neutrophil. The bodies' main defense against elastase degradation is the protein, alpha-1-protease inhibitor, secreted by activated monocytes (or macrophages) at the site of the inflammation. While alpha-1-protease inhibitor is an effective inhibitor of free elastase, it is unable to affect the activity of the enzyme when it is bound to the surface of neutrophils. In this study, in vitro assays, using a chromogenic substrate for elastase, were used to evaluate the interaction of alpha-1-PI with a common CF treatment - DNAase. Finally, the elastase inhibitory properties of the triterpenoid compound, ursolic acid, was evaluated in vitro. It was found, in contrast to the endogenous alpha-1-PI, that ursolic acid is an effective inhibitor of the cell bound form of elastase. This finding has important implications for developing the most effective therapy to alleviate both the congestion and net tissue damage that characterize this fatal disease.

THE ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL AND IMMUNOMODULATING ACTIVITY OF DRAGON PLANT
Ting-Ting Lau, Ong Li Bing, Tan Hui Fang
Victoria Junior College, Singapore

Extracts of various parts of Dragon Plant (Rhaphidophora korthalsii) are believed to contain high level of antioxidants and decoctions made from the leaves are traditionally recommended for cancer treatment. (K.T.Wong, B.K.H.Tan.1996). Our experiment aims to further establish this belief by carrying out antioxidant test and cell line experiment. The antioxidant test allows us to find out the total antioxidant potential of the leaves and stems of the Dragon Plant. The cell line experiment uses mouse macrophage cells to find out the effects of the herb solution on them. In this whole research, we found out that the Dragon Plant has antioxidant properties and may have the ability to stimulate immune cells. The antioxidant test shows that the Dragon Plant solution is able to remove free radicals more efficiently than the other herbs tested. The viability for the macrophage cells also increases for the dragon plant sample in the cell line experiment. Hence, we conclude that dragon plant may be effective in boosting our immune system against cancer and other diseases.

EFFECT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC ON WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT: WILL CLASSICAL MUSIC AFFECT WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS?
Richie Kimlong Huynh, Ryan Kimlong Huynh
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, Minnesota, United States

White blood cells play a vital role in defending the body against infection or disease. This study’s purpose was to find out whether or not classical music would affect the white blood cell count of high school students. Hypothesis tested: If high school students listened to classical music, then their white blood cell count would be higher than that of high school students who didn’t listen to classical music. Twenty-one students participated in this research; eleven listened to twenty minutes of classical music (no other activity was done simultaneously) each day for six weeks. The other students were not manipulated. Blood samples were obtained once a week five times over the six weeks and were stained with Wright’s Solution. Each week, from four fields per slide, an average white blood cell count was determined for each slide, and then for each group. High school students who listened to classical music had a higher white blood cell count on average than high school students who didn’t listen to classical music. The data was analyzed with a t-Test. There was a two percent probability that the difference of the change in the white blood cell count averages was due to chance, therefore the change was significant. Supporting the hypothesis, it was concluded that students who listen to classical music have a healthier body and immune system because they had more white blood cells, therefore a larger defense against diseases and infection. This is beneficial to immunity and health studies.

THE EFFECTS OF ASPARTAME OBSERVED IN THE MASS OF MUS MUSCULUS
Elaine Adelman Hulteng, Rachel Reitmeyer
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, OR, USA

The experimental goal is to observe mass fluctuation in Mus musculus. This topic was chosen because effects of aspartame have been highly discussed, but research pertaining to mass gain in mice is scarce. Research from several sources referred to aspartame as a “diet sugar” or a substitute, and it was for this reason, and anecdotal evidence, that sucrose was hypothesized to yield a higher mass gain than either aspartame or water.<br><br> Twelve mice were put into three blocks (four mice each). Each block contained two males, and two females housed separately. The groups ingested distilled water, a 0.2% sucrose solution, or a 0.2% aspartame solution. Mass and food consumption were monitored daily. <br><br> After the final day of testing, the female aspartame block increased 21% in mass. The mass gain in the female sucrose block was 25%, female water-16%, male aspartame-46%, male sucrose-55%, and male water-44%. In both sexes, the sucrose block had the largest mass gain, followed by aspartame and water. The fact that the aspartame blocks in both sexes gained a higher mass leads to the conclusion that the mice were not gaining mass from the water, but perhaps as an effect of the aspartame. Background research has suggested that Leptin, a chemical that is secreted when the body is satiated, may not be secreted fully in the presence of aspartame.<br><br> Though these results are interesting, further research into aspartame and its possible connections to Leptin would prove beneficial to the average aspartame consumer. <br><br>

STUDY OF THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT OF PHAENICIA SERICATA MAGGOTS YEAR TWO OF AN ON GOING PROJECT
Sergei Chávez, María José Huamaní
Albert Einstein High School, Lima 1, Lima, Perú

At this present moment in Peru the diabetes´ incidence is increasing. Many of the diabetics need to be amputated because of gangrene produced by some infectous bacteria, like Staphylococcus Aureus. This is mainly where antibiotics are not effective. Our purpose was to find an alternative solution. We discovered that in cases like these, the maggots of Phaenicia Sericata could be used because they have some antibacterial properties.<br><br>To develop the project, we firstly tried to get a continous population of maggots. With a sterile medium adding some nutrients, and with a natural medium. In a natural medium we achieved better results. Afterward we started proving the maggots antibacterial effects. To do this we attempted with blended maggots and ground dehydrated maggots to get the antibacteial substance (enzymes); these were applied to the bacteria which grew in agar Müeller Hinton.<br><br>We concluded that he antibacterial substance is secreted while they are eating.<br><br>In the next year we want to do a general protocol of this natural alternative, to apply this to people having infected wounds that can’t respond to the antibiotics, and risk to an amputation.<br><br>

SARS: THERE IS A CURE!
Hamza Mohaimeen Bari, Arif Ali Awan
Wagar High School, Montreal, Qc, Canada

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious respiratory illness reported recently in parts of Asia and Canada. A novel corona virus (CoV) has been isolated and then identified, as the cause of the SARS for which there is currently no effective treatment. Given the unresolved global threat of the SARS CoV epidemic, the rapid development of efficacious antiviral drugs is urgently needed. The SARS CoV genome sequence has been recently published. The key replicative enzyme SARS CoV main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive target of antiviral chemotherapy. The crystal structure of the SARS CoV Mpro has been solved. Detailed structural study of the substrate binding cavity revealed that there is a high degree of specificity of P1 glutamine interactions with the binding pocket of SARS CoV Mpro. Less preference of P2 Leucine as compared to the other corona viruses indicated a larger S2 subsite of this viral protein. A 3-D pharmacophore was generated. Subsets of chemical structures were extracted from the commercial databases by using the defined pharmacophore. Compounds mapping to the pharmacophore were docked into the substrate-binding cavity and scored. The selected chemicals were assayed against the SARS CoV Mpro for their inhibitory activity. Three of the compounds showed significant inhibition of the SARS CoV Mpro at less than 30microM. This study provides potential lead compounds for specific SARS CoV protease inhibitors. It also signifies the utility of computational techniques for rapid discovery of inhibitors for novel targets.

IS YOUR CHILD AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES?
Rahul Beeravolu Reddy, Andrew James Mullally
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, Michigan, USA

Our project’s goal was to assess what percent of 7th grade students at Fort Gratiot Middle School had risk factors for developing Type 2 Diabetes and to determine if high school students presenting information on Type 2 Diabetes, physical activity, and healthy eating habits could increase physical activity and promote healthier eating habits. We predicted that at least 15% of the students had risk factors for developing Type 2 Diabetes and that our presentation could positively influence their eating habits and physical activity. <br><br> A baseline questionnaire assessing risk factors and lifestyle was given to 84 students. A three-day baseline food diary was completed. Next, a presentation was given on Type 2 Diabetes, healthy eating habits, and physical activity. They then completed another food diary to assess the immediate impact. At six weeks, they completed a final food diary and questionnaire assessing their lifestyle. <br><br> We found that 43% had risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes, primarily family history. We observed a significant reduction in daily junk food consumption from 2.19±0.14 to 1.72±0.14 servings. Preference for physical over sedentary activity was significantly increased by a factor of 0.21±0.09. Use of the nutrition label was also significantly increased from 1.31±0.18 to 2.23±0.18 degrees of preference. <br><br> We conclude that in our study 43% of the students had risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes and that a presentation by high school students can positively influence the eating habits and lifestyle of 7th grade students.<br><br>

One of the ills that affect most the human being is the depression. It is known the difficulty to diagnose it. To aid in this process this project was developed, whose purpose is to test the analysis of the voice spectrum as an aid in the diagnosis of depression.<br><br>Regarding the fact that the number of depressed women is twice the number of depressed men, the research was made only with women. To develop this research, it was needed the formulation of questions which could make possible the analysis of certain phonemes in interviews with depressed women as well as in interviews with a control group.<br><br>It was sought for mathematical formulas in the literature that could do the analysis of the voice spectrum of the interviewed people, and was found the Fourier Transform, which had been used in this area. As this mathematical treatment was already implemented in a specific software for voice analysis, this program was used to obtain the voice formants and its bandwidths, parameters able to promote the differentiation between the voices.<br><br>The realized analysis showed that is possible to create methods able to evaluate emotional states of depression, concerning the results achieved with this research.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE TUMOR SUPPRESSING EFFECTS OF PHYTOSTEROLS ON AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS
Archie Cardell Taylor, Andrea Rucker, Tashika Kirkland
Yazoo City High School, Yazoo City, MS 39194, United States

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effectiveness of the phytosterol as a tumor-suppressing chemical on Agrobacterium tumefacines. It is hypothesized that the phytosteorls contained in the peanut oil will suppress the tumor growth produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In Phase I of the procedures, twelve sunflower seeds were divided into one control group and three experimental groups (A, B, and C). Three seeds were potted in each group. A phytosterol solution consisting of 250 ml of refined peanut oil and 250 mL of distilled water was concocted. The control group was watered with tap water. Experimental groups B and C were watered with distilled water. Plants were placed in an environmental chamber at 100 F. The plant growth was recorded daily. In Phase II, test tubes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were obtained. All plants in the control group and the experimental groups were watered with the phytosterols solution. In Group C, the phytosterol solution was applied to the stem with a sterile cotton swab. Tumor size was measured daily. The results showed that the phytosterol solution did suppress the crown gall tumor growth in both experimental groups B and C. Crown gall nodule growth was larger on the control group than the experimental groups. It has been concluded that our hypothesis was accurate. The results form our experimentation suggest a significant role of phytosterols in inhibiting tumor cell growth in plants. The results can be extrapolated to help suppress cancer growth in humans.

GASTRIC SARCOMA: AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CANNABINOIDS AS TREATMENT FOR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
Kristen Maria Wells, Karen Marie Jones
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States

Cancer is a growing epidemic. The ACS estimates that 1,368,030 people will be diagnosed with cancer in 2004; only 63% are expected to live more than five years. Common cancer treatments are considered to be less than 50% effective. <br><br> Cannabinoids, meanwhile, have long been considered a miracle treatment. New studies are emerging on the effects of Cannabinoids on cancer, most showing Cannabinoids as being anti-tumor agents; this being the first documented study on gastric sarcoma. <br><br> This experiment was designed to investigate Cannabinoids and rhabdomyosarcoma. First, it was vital to determine if the Cannabinoid receptors were present, and then how the rhabdomyosarcoma cells would react when treated. We believed that when treated, cell growth would be inhibited. We used RNA isolation, Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction to create cDNA. From there, we determined that the receptors were present and treated the cells with both a WIN 55, 212-2 (a synthetic Cannabinoid) solution as well as a matching solution using the medium the cannabinoids were dissolved in.<br><br> Both the medium and WIN treated cells had comparatively similar results in that neither had significantly varying rates of cell death. As of now, it is impossible to determine whether or not the Cannabinoid had a considerable effect on the cells. <br><br> This study is significant because it was the first of its kind, and because it showed there is more than one factor involved in this process. However minor the differences were between the cells, results showed more cell death in treated cells. <br><br>

MODELING THE SPREAD OF TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES IN BOS TAURUS AND HOMO SAPIENS IN JAVA
Jaydev Mahadevan, Imaad Razzaque
Ladue Horton Watkins High School, St. Louis, MO, USA

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, is a crippling and invariably fatal disorder that attacks the nervous system of common cattle. Unfortunately, BSE jumps species from cows to humans, spawning a variant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) that is both incurable and deadly. This disease presents a serious health threat to humans. Given certain environmental variables, our goal is to build a computer simulation of the spread of mad cow disease. The simulation is constructed using the Java programming language. Our goal is to predict the number and rate of infection in cows and subsequent transmission of vCJD to humans to a realistic accuracy in the state of Missouri. There were three phases to our project: gathering research, constructing the theory, and building the computer simulation. Once we had found enough statistical data, we were then able to make a basic flow chart to track the interaction of the disease and the organisms in the simulation environment. The computer program is an implementation of the flow chart and factors in many different environmental variables. Over the course of ten years in the simulation, many cows were infected with BSE, but few were able to spread the disease to humans. Several trials were undertaken to verify our findings. From this data, we concluded that although vCJD is deadly, humans are at very low risk when eating beef in Missouri. However, this disease could potentially devastate any cattle herd it infects, making it a significant concern in current agricultural policy.

ELIMINATING PATHOGENIC VIBRIO AND COLIFORM BACTERIA FROM CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA: PREVENTION OF GASTROENTERITIS AND SEPTICEMIA FROM SEAFOOD POISONING
Esther Yeeway Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville FL, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to(1)identify bacteria species in raw oysters species Crassostrea virginica,(2)determine if any condiments commonly eaten with oysters effectively inhibit the identified bacteria,(3)determine if a freeze-and-thaw technique effectively inhibits the identified bacteria, and(4)determine if condiments and antibiotics produce additive/synergistic inhibitory effects against the growth of the identified bacteria.<br><br> Experimentation involved condiments (Tabasco sauce, cocktail sauce, mustard, Louisiana hot sauce, vinegar, lemon juice) and antibiotics. Using routine bacteria identification techniques, bacteria were counted, compared, measured, identified, and photographed under the microscope. <br><br> Two categories of bacteria were isolated from Crassostrea virginica: halophilic Vibrio species and nonhalophilic bacteria, i.e. members of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas. All species isolated were pathogenic and are able to cause clinical infections. Among halophilic bacteria, several Vibrio species were isolated, including Vibrio vulnificus, widely acknowledged as the most virulent Vibrio species. Among nonhalophilic bacteria, several gramnegative Enterobacteriaceae members were identified, including Moellerella wisconsensis, Enterobacter amnigenus, and Proteus vulgaris.<br><br> All six common condiments tested significantly reduced bacteria growth compared to the control group(p<0.04). Tabasco sauce significantly inhibited more bacteria than compared to the other tested condiments (p<0.05). The freeze-and-thaw technique also inhibited bacteria in the raw oysters, although not as significantly as other tested condiments.<br><br> Tabasco sauce offered additive effects against bacteria inhibition with cephalothin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin on Vibrio vulnificus isolated from Crassostrea virginica.

ESTIMATION OF PERCENT BODY FAT USING A STEREOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAMMETRIC TECHNIQUE
Alex Conway Buchanan
Myers Park High School, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA

Percent body fat is one of the best indicators of obesity, however, it is difficult to accurately determine. Popular methods for analyzing percent body fat are: bioelectric impedance testing, skin fold testing with a set of calipers, and volumetric techniques which compare volume and weight to determine density and estimate percent body fat. Photogrammetry utilizes stereo image parallax to determine 3-D coordinates, making volumetric analysis possible.<br><br> After obtaining IRB approval and informed consent, subjects were asked to stand in front of a binary projection pattern while digital photographs were taken. The photographs were analyzed by a computer program written in Java and volumes were assesed. Volume measurements were compared with weight to determine body density, and percent body fat was estimated. The values obtained were then compared with other method’s measurements.<br><br> BMI, percent body fat as determined by the bioelectric impedance method, and values given by the photogrammetric method were compared with results from the skin fold caliper method. BMI had a correlation coefficient (r value) of .53 when plotted against percent body fat. Bioelectric impedance had a coefficient of determination (r^2 value) of .87, and the photogrammetric method had a coefficient of determination of .79. Therefore, the photogrammetric method is comparable to bioelectric impedance in accuracy.<br><br> The photogrammetric method shows promise for future applications in noninvasive anthropomorphic measurements for disease detection and other applications in medical research. Refinements in accuracy and computer analysis are areas of further development. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF 2-HYDROXY ESTRONE EICOSONATE ON WEIGHT GAIN WITH ZUCKER RATS
Alison Lea Siler
Garinger High School Charlotte, N.C. USA

Obesity is excess body fat, which is a fast-growing epidemic and one of the largest public health problems in the industrialized world. Obesity increases the risk of many diseases, can cause early deaths, and may lead to social and emotional problems. Several Estrone molecules have been tested and consistently showed a decrease in weight gain, but were considered too estrogenic. At these levels, estrogen can lead to major health problems. It was hypothesized that 2-Hydroxy Estrone Eicosonate would decrease weight gain in young adult Zucker Rats. To test this hypothesis, 30 female Zucker rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 and given vehicle or 2-Hydroxy Estrone Eicosonate at low or high doses for 14 days to see if weight loss would occur. Results show that the 30 Zucker rats had no difference in weight gain between the groups. Therefore, we conclude that 2-Hydroxy Estorne Eicosonate is not suitable as a therapy for weight loss.

RISK FACTORS FOR ADOLESCENT OBESITY
Ami Natvarlal Dalsania
Titusville High School, Titusville Florida, USA

The United States is faced with a rising epidemic of adolescent obesity. In this study, I examine the various lifestyle choices that may be causes for adolescent obesity. A questionnaire asking about daily lifestyle habits was distributed to high school adolescents. This survey was composed of questions concerning eating habits, physical activity, and parent history. Each individual’s height and weight were calculated. The collected data included height, weight, age, gender, which was then plugged into an Omron Body Fat Analyzer to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and fat percentage. Each individual’s BMI and age were then plotted into a BMI-for-age chart to determine whether the individual was underweight (below the fifth percentile), healthy (between the sixth and eighty-fifth percentile), at risk for obesity (between the eighty-fifth percentile and ninety-fifth percentile), or overweight (greater than the ninety-fifth percentile). A total of 73 adolescents participated. Of these participants, three percent were underweight, eighty-three percent were healthy, seven percent were at risk for becoming overweight, and seven percent were overweight. The significance of the variation of BMI for each lifestyle choice was determined by the standard deviation of each characteristic. In this study, I found that significant statistical results showed that individuals who dieted, ate alone rather than with family, did less physical exercise, spent more time on the computer or in front of the television, or had parents with medical conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, all had higher BMIs.

Currently, over 120 million Americans suffer from an incurable disease or condition. Of those, 45%, or 58 million, have cardiac-related pathologies. Congestive heart failure (CHF), which affects 5 million Americans and leads to a two-year mortality rate of 70-80%, results from damaged heart muscle, often post-myocardial infarction. Since myocardium does not regenerate, a replacement source of cardiomyocytes for cell transplantation therapy is urgently needed. Stem cells are capable of differentiating into many cell types. Though embryonic stem cells have the greatest pluripotency, they may never be used clinically due to the immense controversy surrounding them. Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are adult stem cells that avoid this controversy, but have limited plasticity. <br><br> The aim of this study was to “dedifferentiate” hMSCs into an embryonic stem cell-like state, thereby increasing their pluripotency, by using the demethylating agents 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). hMSCs (ATCC) were treated with 1, 3, or 10 uM 5-azaC/BrdU for 2-3 weeks. Following treatment, dedifferentiated hMSCs were cocultured with rat cardiomyocytes (ATCC; H9c2) for 3-12 days to stimulate milieu-dependent differentiation. Total RNA was then extracted from each of the cells, amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and run through gel electrophoresis. Expression of human cardiomyocyte-specific genes – hANP, alpha-MHC, MLC-2v/a, GATA-4, Nkx2-5, and C TnI/T – was observed in the 5-azaC and/or BrdU-treated hMSCs, meaning they converted into human cardiomyocytes. Immunochemistry results are pending. These novel findings may lead to uncontroversial, effective cellular therapies for not only CHF, but also hundreds of other afflictions prevalent in society. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF P53 ON THE SENSITIVITY OF CANCER CELLS TO CHEMOTHERAPY
Jennifer Jody Chen
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, United States

This project examined the squamous cell carcinoma line A253 and the relation between p53 status and sensitivity to chemotherapy. By examining the relationship between the two, understanding of chemotherapeutic potency could improve as tumors are homogeneous in mutations, including those involving p53. Using this data, patients with tumors with multiple varieties of p53 mutations could be better served. <br><br>Three different drugs, cisplatin, taxol, and 5-FU were tested, 5-FU being the current standard skin cancer chemotherapeutic agent. In order to simulate a tumor with heterogeneous mutations, three different types of plasmids, empty and those encoded with the genes mutant p53 or wild-type p53, were transfected into the A253 cells, which lacks functional p53. A p53 immunocytochemical staining were done to confirm that the transfected cells were producing p53. <br><br>The results obtained through the MTT Assay showed that all drug displayed increased potency when p53 was present. 5-FU was shown to be a relatively ineffective drug and demonstrated no dose-dependence. Cisplatin was very effective, with a clear dose-dependence relationship. Taxol was significant in its increase in potency in the presence of wild-type or mutant p53. A DAPI staining was done to confirm apoptosis was the mechanism of cell death. <br><br>The results of this study could be used to better match up patients with chemotherapy and achieve maximum results with minimal side-effects. Patients with certain mutations could be given the drug which best treated their specific tumor composition. With more effective drug selection, dosage could be decreased.<br><br>

GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF SPONDYLOTHORACIC DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
Edrick Josue Acevedo
Southwestern Educational Society

Spondylothoracic dysplasia (STD, MIM#277300) is an autosomal recessive disorder with high prevalence in Puerto Rican populations. Typical findings include segmentation and formation defects of the spine. Short and rigid neck, protuberant abdomen and inguinal hernias are frequent findings as well. <br><br> There were two hypotheses in the project. The first one is that there is a specific phenotype of Spondylothoracic dysplasia in the Puerto Rican population. The second hypothesis is that there is a common genetic mutation causing Spondylothoracic dysplasia in Puerto Rican populations. This could most likely be caused by a founder effect.<br><br> Blood DNA analysis was performed to determine the natural history, phenotype and genotype characterization of the disease. Sequential pulmonary function test, establishments of anthropomorphic measurements and comparison of height and thoracic circumferences, has allowed determining the minimal measurements required for survival.<br><br> Genetic mapping of chromosome 2q31 has been established and further characterization and reduction of the critical region to 3cM has been achieved. This has allowed establishing the genetic and phenotypic differences among syndromes with similar phenotypes. This information may be useful in the development of molecular probe to perform pre-natal diagnosis of the disease and a correlation for survival depending on the haplotype. Further genetic studies using polymorphic markers and candidate genes that map to this critical region is of great importance as well.

DOES CONSUMPTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOLIC ACID AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SENESCENT DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER?
Kyla Davis Horn
Cocoa Beach Junior/Senior High School, Cocoa Beach, Florida, US

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of folic acid on reproductive success in senescent Drosophila melanogaster. D. melanogaster were selected for this experiment because they consume dietary folic acid and are suitable for laboratory studies. Folic acid was selected as the experimental treatment because it is essential to DNA synthesis and cell division, and also because folic acid deficiency is common worldwide, especially among pregnant women and the elderly. An increasing number of people are postponing parenthood until later in life; thus, this study's results might have implications for humans. <br><br> The researcher hypothesized that senescent D. melanogaster treated with supplemental folic acid would produce a greater number of viable offspring than similarly aged D. melanogaster without the supplement.<br><br> Four trials of treatment and control groups were established. Once the parent generation flies reached 16 days since eclosion, their emerged offspring were monitored, and the fertility rate was calculated. Parent flies were separated from offspring into new vials weekly, and the process was repeated until the parent generation died. Emerged offspring were examined microscopically for visible mutations, and their DNA was analyzed using slab gel electrophoresis. <br><br> No mutations were visually detected in any of the 2,133 offspring. DNA results differed slightly between the treatment and control groups. The fertility rate was 21% higher in the treatment group. A paired t test of the fertility rate data indicated that the results were not statistically significant. There was insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis, but further investigation may be warranted.<br><br>

HEMODYNAMICS AND HEART FAILURE--UTILIZATION OF IMPEDANCE CARDIOGRAPHY TO MEASURE THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE--YEAR 2
Winston Harmon Messer
Presbyterian Christian High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA

Congestive heart failure (CHF) costs $56 billion/year. Better management can reduce symptoms, mortality, hospital readmissions and expenditure. This project created a database of heart failure patients whose progress can be followed with custom software designed for this research. Experimental goals for this project included testing ICG’s reliability and ability to measure patient progress with titration of oral medications in the outpatient setting. <br><br> In Phase VI, ICGs measured success in titrating oral heart failure medications in the outpatient setting. All patients (N=65) had two or more ICG data pairs recorded for analysis. Best pairs were studied as subgroup A and all data pairs were analyzed as subgroup B. There was a statistically significant improvement in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and systemic vascular resistance index (all p<.001). <br><br> An important goal of this work was to demonstrate ICG’s utility in measuring progressive changes in oral medications, and patients with multiple data points were reviewed in Phase VII. 27 patients had three or more ICG data points. Analysis of patients (N=17) having four or more ICGs, representing a minimum of 3 heart failure protocol medicine adjustments, showed linearity to these improvements. <br><br> ICGs offer an inexpensive, reliable test to document outpatient medication titration for heart failure patients. With this outpatient CHF clinic approach, this year's results for this cohort show an improvement in functional status (1.4 improved NYHA functional class) and a potential reduction in mortality (3.1%/24 month mortality).

A CONTINUATION: PROLONGING THE ONSET OF DIABETES MELLIUTS AND PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS USING ALPHA LIPOIC ACID AND ACETYL L-CARNITINE
Casey Leigh Dwiggins
Moore High School, Moore, Ok, USA

<br><br>This project in its current year is examining the effects of Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl L-Carnitine on Diabetes Mellitus. The initial idea of this project was to determine the precautions and/or supplements that could be used to preclude the detrimental onset and complications of Diabetes Mellitus. <br><br>The supplements Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl L-Carnitine were chosen to use due to the positive results that occurred in their use on other diseases. The supplements were given to the mice daily through their food. Weekly weight of the mice was taken to ensure that each mouse was ingesting adequate amounts of supplement. Weekly blood glucose levels were also taken to provide results of each mouse in its’ current stage of Diabetes Mellitus onset.<br><br> Various positive results were concluded as an outcome of the research. Using Alpha Lipoic Acid proved to be successful. The average blood glucose level was 49 points away from the point of diagnosis. Acetyl L-Carnitine was slightly less successful than Alpha Lipoic Acid when used by itself; the average blood glucose level for the group was 53 points away from the point of diagnosis. However, when Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl L-Carnitine were combined results provided a celebratory outcome. The average blood glucose level for the combination group was 76 points away from the point of diagnosis; the results were directly on target. The significance of these results can be seen compared to the control group, which had an average blood glucose level 49 points over the point of diagnosis.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF A DAILY DIET ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN HUMAN BEINGS.
Janaki Vasudevan
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville Oklahoma, U.S.A.

Antibiotic resistance has become an increasingly alarming threat. Antibiotics are the best defense against life-threatening bacteria, but their overuse may eliminate their effectiveness. Farm animals raised for meat are routinely fed antibiotics in sub lethal doses thereby enhancing the potential to develop antibiotic resistance. This project was designed to test the correlation between human diet and antibiotic resistance found in enteric bacterial strains. Escherichia coli, a widely prevalent commensal intestinal bacterium that can become pathogenic, was studied in this experiment. E. coli was isolated from the fecal samples of eight vegetarian and non-vegetarian children aged three weeks to five years old. The children were further sub stratified according to their prior antibiotic exposure. E. coli isolates were streaked onto MacConkey Agar “X” plates for sensitivity testing. Antibiotic impregnated disks containing either Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, or Tetracycline were individually placed in each quadrant and evaluated 24 hours later. The female and male vegetarian without previous antibiotic exposure and the female vegetarian with previous antibiotic exposure had no resistance to any of the antibiotics. The male vegetarian with previous antibiotic exposure was resistant to Streptomycin and Ampicillin. The four non- vegetarians, including those exposed to antibiotics, were resistant to all of the antibiotics except for Chloramphenicol. This study’s conclusions are that non-vegetarians have a higher risk of developing an antibiotic resistance based on their diet, irrespective of prior antibiotic exposure. Vegetarians may develop some resistance if exposed to antibiotics during their lives.

CURCUMIN SENSITIZES HUMAN COLON CANCER MOSER CELLS TO THE ANTI-TUMOR DRUG VINBLASTINE BY INHIBITING THE EXPRESSION OF THE MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE 1 GENE (MDR-1)
Vikram Agarwal
Caddo Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, USA

Colon cancer has become a major problem in the United States. Many types of cancers, including those of the colon, exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR), a problem in which there is an increased expression of the MDR-1 gene that codes for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), causing increased drug efflux, especially to hydrophobic drugs such as vinblastine. Chemosensitizers are necessary to inhibit the MDR-1 gene and increase the intracellular concentrations of anti-carcinogenic drugs. Curcumin, an extract of the popularly consumed Eastern spice turmeric, has been researched for its ability to chemosensitize various types of cancer cells to chemotherapies. The purpose of this experiment was to characterize the effect of different concentrations of curcumin on multidrug resistance through measurements of P-gp and to assess the value of curcumin as a possible chemosensitizing agent for vinblastine in vitro in human MOSER colon cancer cells.<br><br> It was found through western immunoblotting that the chemical curcumin decreased P-gp levels dose-dependently at concentrations below 15 M in the MOSER cells. With the help of an MTS assay, it was possible to quantitatively measure cell death after periods of drug treatment. It was determined that curcumin did not effectively kill cells in this in vitro study. It was ascertained, however, that the drug greatly increased the efficacy of extremely minute levels of vinblastine (<.075 M) that were otherwise shown to be ineffective without curcumin. <br><br> The two treatments that were tested seemed to work synergistically to inhibit cell growth; curcumin sensitized a MOSER cell by inhibiting the expression of the MDR-1 gene, while vinblastine killed the cells. This project shows both the effects of curcumin and the mechanism by which the drug affects colon cancer cells. <br><br>

TRACKING DYSLEXIA WITH A DNA PROBE
Patrick A. Herklotz
Pine Creek High School, Colorado Springs, CO, USA

Dyslexia is defined as an impairment of the ability to read. Studies have shown that dyslexia can also affect other areas of learning including mathematics. The researcher’s family has a history of dyslexia, and this project investigates whether the disorder is genetic.<br><br>Current research indicates dyslexia is encoded in gene sequence DYX1C1 on chromosome 15 (15q21) of the human genome. Researchers have found other possible genes coding for dyslexia such as DYX1 and DYX6. Since research has indicated that DYX1C1 is the most probable gene coding for dyslexia, this gene was tested for in the experiment.<br><br>The experiment was conducted in two parts: a control study and a population study. In both studies, cheek samples were obtained from the subject and a DNA probe was used on the samples to detect the presence of the gene DYX1C1.<br><br>The control study tested the researcher’s parents; one of whom has dyslexia (father) and the other does not (mother). The population study tested 41 adults using numbered samples of DNA and questionnaires obtained from the respondents. The numbered questionnaire was used to see if self-identified characteristics of dyslexia (scrambling the order of numbers or letters when reading, writing, or doing math) correlated to the results of the numbered DNA sample.<br><br>The control study showed that the gene DYX1C1 was present in the father (who has dyslexia) but not in the mother. The population study showed the gene DYX1C1 to be present in all respondents who indicated symptoms of dyslexia.

DO HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES?
Tia Marie Filhiol 
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL, USA

Each year, patients have allergic reactions –some life threatening- to the standard prescription medication given to cure Strep throat: Penicillin, Amoxicillin, and Erythromycin. The purpose of this project was to determine if homeopathic or less synthetic remedies can be used to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes (the bacteria that causes Strep throat) and give an alternative treatment to this illness. If homeopathic remedies are tested against Streptococcus pyogenes, then my hypothesis was that spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon oil will inhibit the bacterial growth.<br><br>In the test, a small sterile blank disk was soaked in individual homeopathic products. Under the biohazard hood, dehydrated Streptococcus pyogenes was mixed with hydration solution using a pipette. 200 microliters of hydrated Streptococcus pyogenes cultured media was transferred with a micropipette to 5% Sheep's Blood agar in petri dishes then spread for even growth. <br><br>One disc containing either the homeopathic products, antibiotic, or blank was placed in the center of each petri dish. This was repeated for each product tested. Plates were placed into an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius and were checked at 24 hours and 72 hours for growth. Measurements were recorded.<br><br>Peppermint, spearmint cinnamon and honey all had areas where they killed Streptococcus pyogenes. Their kill zones were comparable to those of the antibiotic discs. <br><br>

A STUDY OF STIMULANT RESPONSE CORRELATIONS: ARTHRITIS, DIABETES, & HYPERTENSION IMPLICATIONS
Phillip Michael Jamison
Noxubee County High School, Macon,MS, United States

Simple and inexpensive methods to raise the awareness among all ages for diseases common to the elderly (Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension) were studied. Curiosity developed from observations of senior citizens prompted the following premises: (1), health status, inadequate and (2), similar health problems were prevalent. <br><br>Four groups each of males and females were selected with five ages (55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70-74) per group for each of the dependent variables (Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension) that occurred within each subject and the control group (no occurrence of the diseases). This study evaluated significant differences in stimulant response lengths to develop correlations between Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension. The speed with which a subject responded determined the stimulant response (shorter segment, quicker response; longer segment, slower response). <br><br>The following averaged stimulant response lengths (cm) for ages 55-74 were obtained: Male Control, 24 cm; Female Control, 34 cm; Male Arthritis, 46 cm; Female Arthritis, 56 cm; Male Diabetes, 36 cm; Female Diabetes, 45 cm; Male Hypertension, 37 cm; and Female Hypertension, 47 cm.<br><br>Correlation (1): stimulant response length, 46 cm in Males and 56 cm in Females, positive indicator for Arthritis. Correlation (2): stimulant response length, 24 cm in Males, and 34 cm in Females, positive indicator for absence of Arthritis. Correlation (3): Male Diabetes and Hypertension groups, similar stimulant response lengths, 36.5 cm and Female Diabetes and Hypertension groups, similar stimulant response lengths, 46.0 cm.<br><br>

DEDUCING COMPARABLE METABOLIC PATHWAYS THROUGH HORMONE FLUCTUATIONS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Dominique Hazard Eghlidi
Southridge High School, Beaverton OR, Unites States

The objective of the experiment is to show Drosophila melanogaster as a valid model of the human metabolic hormonal pathways. In assessing drosophilas’s reaction to hormones and anti-androgens, their ability to be used as a model of the human hormone process can be validated. Currently medical research is shifting toward metabolic hormone testing because a large majority of the population is effected by a metabolic or hormonal illness of some type. In this experiment five groups of thirty drosophila were tested for hair loss and then hair re-growth, both common symptoms of metabolic or hormone related illness and can be measured on the flies visually under a dissecting microscope. By stimulating hair loss and hair re-growth through topical DHT application it can be seen if drosophila have similar metabolic pathways in relation to hormone processing. As humans would lose their hair from excess production of DHT so did the drosophila after the topical applications of DHT, showing they process hormones similar to humans. Next, small doses of Serenoa repens were administered through the fly medium so the flies would ingest the anti-androgen to inhibit enzyme 5-alpha-reductatse the producer of DHT. Hair re-growth was seen in the flies given the anti-androgen while the flies that were not had no hair re-growth. This shows Serenoa repens to be a valid anti-androgen for hair re-growth, which has not been shown before. The importance of drosophila being a valid model is they have a short lifespan of two weeks, are easy to work with, and have a simplistic body chemistry as compared to large vertebrates like humans and mice equating to less external factors causing experimental errors.

THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF FISH OIL ON BREAST CANCER: A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Triparna Ghosh-Choudhury
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Dietary intervention is a safe and convenient way for prevention and therapy of many diseases. Contribution of dietary fat to breast cancer risk is controversial. This project systematically investigates the effect of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), found in fish oil, on breast tumor growth using a nude mouse model developed in previous studies. A diet containing 10% fish oil significantly lowered human breast cancer cell (MDA MB-231)-derived tumor burden in mice compared to unrestricted diet. Analysis of tumors from fish oil fed mice showed (a) increase in the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, (b) decrease in the tumor promoting enzymes phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and Akt kinase, (c) increase in pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome c and executor caspase 3 activity and (d) reduction in activating phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB p65 subunit and its target anti-apoptotic BclXL. These data provide the first evidence that the beneficial effect of fish oil on breast cancer growth is due to modulation of the above-mentioned growth promoting enzymes and apoptosis regulatory proteins in the tumor. To farther investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis the effect of two major PUFAs from fish oil was examined on MDA MB-231 cells in vitro. These constituents inhibited NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation and DNA binding, resulting in increased apoptosis. Furthermore, fish oil constituents inhibited transcription of BclXL gene. Together these data demonstrate that PUFAs present in fish oil target both proliferative and apoptotic signaling in breast cancer cells. These findings may potentially lead to development of more effective chemopreventive regimes for breast cancer patients. <br><br> <br><br>

ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITY OF A CHINESE HERB, COPTIS CHINENSIS
Qiaozi Yang
Westfield Sr. High School, Westfield, NJ, USA

In this project, I looked for an effective, natural anti-cancer treatment without the damage to normal cells caused by chemotherapy. After multiple tests on normal and cancerous cells derived from the same cell line, the herb Coptis chinensis demonstrated the ability to specifically target cancer cells (80% cancer cell deaths vs. 20% normal cell deaths). Testing on other normal and cancerous cells confirmed this result.<br><br> <br><br>While experimenting, I discovered that C. chinensis was naturally fluorescent and could be directly observed from inside cancer cells. This inspired me to use electrophoresis to separate the fluorescent components of C. chinensis and to trace their individual presences in cells using fluorescent microscopy. I designed a miniature electrophoresis device to isolate these fluorescent components, of which five were positively charged and two were negatively charged. Through individual testing, I found that the positively charged components were responsible for the selective killing effect. A possible mechanism for this selectivity emerged after observations using fluorescent microscopy. The positive, fluorescent components would penetrate and accumulate in cancer cell nuclei but not in normal cells, thus killing only cancer cells. The negative, fluorescent components could not penetrate either cancerous or normal cells and did not affect cell growth. This result leads to a tentative suggestion that the development of some forms of cancer may be related to a change in electric charges within cells or on cell membranes. In addition, the selective cytotoxicity of C. chinensis may be the basis for development of a superior anti-cancer drug.

STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF MANDIBULAR SECRETIONS OF AEDES AEGYPTII "SALINAS WILD TYPE" ON DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPES.
Edgardo Angel Meléndez - Muñiz
Academia Nuestra Señora de la Providencia, San Juan, Puerto Rico

Information regarding Aedes aegyptii points towards the potential use of the proteins present in saliva of these insects, as an anticoagulant agent for curative or treatment purposes on humans. Several researches revealed that nearly a dozen of the molecules present in the saliva of mosquitoes have proteins that carry out the function of optimizing blood suction during the biting process. This is why this research intends to study and present evidence that support the findings concerning the capability presented by proteins found in mosquitoes’ saliva as anticoagulants of human blood.<br><br> In this research, four experimental groups were used (one per each serological blood type) and also a control group. The experimental groups were exposed to Aedes aegyptii mosquito saliva using three different solutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000) with Saline Phosphate Solution. The control group had no exposure to saliva.<br><br> After completing this research it was found that the Aedes aegyptii saliva is an effective anticoagulant on human blood without having any relation with the blood serological type. The amount of saliva added to the sample is what affects the coagulation process. The bigger the amount of saliva added to the blood, the longer the blood takes to coagulate.

THE ROLE OF ENOLASE PHOSPHORYLATION IN SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM
Taruna Singh
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights Ohio, USA

Bacteria are developing widespread resistance to current antibiotics, thus new types of drugs directed at different aspects of bacterial physiology are urgently needed. Most bacteria have homologs of eukaryotic protein kinasis and phosphatases, however the role of serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation in bacteria is not yet understood. In Salmonella typhimurium one protein found to have multiple phosphorylation states is the carbon metabolic enzyme Enolase. Enolase is an attractive model for understanding bacterial phosphoproteins in general because its structure and function are already characterized.<br><br> The simplest hypothesis is that phosphorylation allows Salmonella to fine tune carbon metabolism in different environments by modulating Enolase interations with other proteins. The aims of this project are first, to identify which amino acids on Enolase are phosphorylated, and second, to determine what growth defects result when these sites cannot be phosphorylated.<br><br> Enolase containing a short additional peptid "tag" has been cloned onto a plasmid. Six potential serine or threonine phosphorylation sites have been identified by comparison to other bacterial and eukaryotic Enolasis and are being individually mutated to alanine. To determine whether phosphorylation is altered, each mutant will be expressed in normal Salmonella and the postion of the tagged mutant on 2-D protein gel will be compared to that of normal Enolase. To determine whether function has been altered, each mutant will be expressed in a stain lacking the normal Enolase gene, and growht of complemented deletion mutant on various individual carbon sources will be compared to that of normal Salmonella.

REDUCING CANCER DEATHS: DEVELOPMENT OF A LAXATIVE FREE COLORECTAL SCREENING EXAM USING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY
Kristina Therese Johnson 
Mayo High Schooo, Rochester MN, USA 

Purpose: To determine and evaluate a method for examining the colon and rectum for polyps without the need for laxative preparation. <br><br>Methods: A realistic silastic colon phantom containing 16 polyps (6 millimeter flat) was constructed using a custom glass mold. Simulated stool was created that mimicked the imaging properties of barium labeled human stool (mean density and three levels of heterogeneity). The phantom was scanned at CT using a clinical technique. Three different stool subtraction algorithms were designed in series-- each addressing problems of earlier versions. Image processing tools included thresholding, expansion and convolution. <br><br> Thirty patients with known or suspected colorectal polyps/cancer were studied after ingesting 20.5 grams of barium over 48 hours. CT Colonography was preformed. Both the stool unsubtracted and subtracted datasets were reviewed by two readers independently. <br><br>Results: A realistic phantom for studying the unprepared colon was developed. Three different stool heterogeneities were created. Three stool subtraction algorithms were tested. The final algorithm employing thresholding (200HU), expansion and convolution (based on point spread function correction) was used to evaluate the patient datasets. Using stool subtraction, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of polyps >1cm were 50-87% and 80-100% respectively. For polyps >5mm the sensitivity and specificity was 43-73% and 0-33% respectively. 92% of patients with large polyps were identified by a radiologist.<br><br>Conclusion: A unique phantom and stool subtraction algorithm were developed for examining the unprepared colon. Detection of significant polyps is feasible. Development of this technology should be continued. <br><br>

EXPLORING THE BORRELIACIDAL FACTOR OF VARIOUS BLOOD SERA ON BORRELIA BURGDORFERI, THE AGENT OF LYME DISEASE, AND BORRELIA LONESTARI, THE PUTATIVE AGENT OF LYME-LIKE ILLNESS
Chelsea Nicole Grigery
Sikeston High School, Sikeston, Missouri 63801, USA

A) The project tested the borreliacidal factor of various blood sera on Borrelia lonestari and Borrelia burgdorferi cultures, and identified laboratory differences between the two spirochetes.<br><br> <br><br>B) Cultures of Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia lonestari were individually exposed to blood sera from the Sceloporus undulates (eastern fence lizard) and Mus musculus (Swiss Webster mouse). PBS was used as a control. Slides from each culture were created and examined at 0-2 hour, 4-6 hour, and 22-24 hour time intervals, using a dark-field microscope. Active spirochetes were counted in each sample and results were recorded.<br><br> <br><br>C) Lizard sera significantly lysed both Borrelia lonestari and Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. In contrast, mouse sera lysed Borrelia lonestari, but not Borrelia burgdorferi. <br><br> <br><br>D) Results indicate the eastern fence lizard is a dead-end host for both Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia lonestari, as spirochetes of both species did not survive exposure to lizard sera. The results also suggest that although mice are important as reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Mus musculus species may not be a suitable reservoir host for Borrelia lonestari, as the spirochetes did not survive exposure to mouse sera. This conclusion is significant for borreliosis researchers, and ultimately for the medical field, as it identifies several important, newly-discovered differences between Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, and Borrelia lonestari, the leading candidate for the cause of Lyme-like illness.<br><br>

SPEED "PIGEONS OR DUCKS" FOOT POSITION IN FEMALES AFFECTING SPRINTING SPEED
Macy Ann Allen
North Lamar High School, Paris, Tx, USA

The relationship between in-toe foot position and out-toe foot position during sprinting 18 meters was studied in female sprinters, nine with natural in-toeing and ten with natural out-toeing. When subjects sprinted in the in-toeing position they appeared to be faster, irregardless of their natural or preferred foot position during sprinting. Natural in-toers (pigeons) were significantly faster sprinting in the in-toe position vs. the out-toe position. Natural out-toers (ducks) were faster sprinting in the in-toed position vs. the out-toed position, as well, yet not as significantly. The findings of this study suggest in-toe foot position during sprinting may be an advantageous component to good sprinting mechanics.

BASED ON THE NORTHWEST POPULATION OF INDIA AND SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION OF THE UNITED STATES IS INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIAL OR BIOLOGICAL?
Supal Janak Desai
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL, USA

The problem that is going to be experimented upon is, based on the northwestern population of India, is intelligence artificial or biological? Based on the research I have read I believe it is believe that within the Desai population will have a biological trait for intelligence. This means that the blood pressure will be at a normal rate, called the cuff pressure. It is also believed that the systole blood pressure will be only a small increase than the cuff rate. The diastolic pressure will be the same rate as the cuff pressure, which will occur 65-70 seconds later. I plan to determine through systemic experimentation and repetition is intelligence a trait or acquired trait within the region of northwest India, or Gujarat.<br><br>In the project I had found out that there was no intelligence gene, through the research I had conducted. The intelligent capabilities that I had research were based on if intelligence could be biological or artificial. Intelligence is an acquired trait that was not passed down from generation to generation. For example, 2 siblings 3.5 years in difference had a 45-point difference in intelligence and in the increase would not have been on a systemic level. <br><br>The trends that were seen were that intelligence within the United State second and third generation Gujarati’s were very much similar, however on the contrary to the same age in India. It was also seen that there were significant increase in blood pressure in the Indian localities, than here, my conclusion with this fact was because of the knowledge of a project. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF PHOSPHORUS AND CAFFEINE ON THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CALCIUM
Amy Therese Servas
Dallastown Area High School, York, PA, USA

It has long been hypothesized that soda depletes calcium in the human body; it is not known whether this is caused by chemical reactivity or corporal removal. The purpose of this project is to determine whether two primary components of most sodas chemically deplete calcium solutions. It was expected that phosphate ions would deplete calcium, while caffeine would not. <br><br>To determine whether depletion was occurring, a compleximetric titration with EDTA was performed on calcium solutions. These solutions were comprised of differing ratios of calcium, phosphates, and caffeine; the solutions also contained the indicator EBT and an ammonia buffer. The calcium reacts with EBT to form a calcium EBT ion, which is red. As EDTA is added, it forms calcium EDTA complex ions; when all the calcium is removed from the EBT the solution becomes blue. At this point it can be assumed that the initial solution contained one mole of calcium for each mole of EDTA titrated. <br><br>The hypothesis was confirmed in that calcium solutions containing phosphate ions had less calcium than pure calcium solutions. However, caffeine also depleted calcium, although to a lesser degree than phosphates. Remarkably, the reduction of calcium concentration in solutions containing both phosphate ions and caffeine was invariably between those of phosphates and of caffeine at each concentration. Further experimentation revealed that caffeine depletes phosphate solutions.

MECHANISMS OF REGULATORY T CELLS IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Leslie Wen-Hsien Tse
Detroiy Country Day Upper School, Beverly Hills, Michigan, USA

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a system used to mimic the pathology of multiple sclerosis in mice. It was recently shown that the depletion of T regulatory cells (Treg) in EAE resistant mice rendered them susceptible to EAE induction. Thus I strive to understand the mechanism of how depletion of Treg cells leads to the development of EAE. My hypothesis is that Treg cells prevent the expansion of myelin-specific autoimmune effector T cells, causing a deficiency in the number of these disease-causing T cells. If my theory proves true, the depletion of Treg cells will allow for the expansion of the autoimmune T cells, ultimately leading to disease development. In these experiments, spleen cells were obtained from myelin basic protein (MBP)-immunized mice previously treated or untreated with anti-CD25 antibodies. The MTT assay was used to assess antigen-specific cellular expansion in cultures and the ELISPOT assay was used to determine the frequency of disease-causing cells as reflected by their production of gamma interferon. Results from the MTT assay indicate that spleen cells from anti-CD25 treated mice expand at a greater rate than those from untreated mice. Similarly, the ELISPOT assay showed that the frequency of gamma interferon-producing cells is much higher in anti-CD25 treated mice than untreated mice. Taken together, results of both sets of experiments are consistent with the notion that regulatory T cells prevent development of EAE, and perhaps MS, by inhibiting the proliferation and expansion of disease-causing T cells. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>

DENDRITIC POLYMER-INSULIN CONJUGATES/NANODEVICES FOR ORAL INSULIN DELIVERY: A SYSTEM FOR OPTIMAL BIOAVAILABILITY IN TYPE 1 DIABETES
Shilpa Naresh Raja
West Bloomfield High School, West Bloomfield, MI, USA

A viable oral insulin form has been the elusive goal of many investigators for decades. An enteric form is the ideal alternative to current invasive therapies. This study combines protein conjugation to dendritic nanodevices, targeting, and microencapsulation to propose an oral drug delivery system of efficacy. In the course of this study, a novel polyol-insulin conjugate was designed and synthesized. Polyol has been proven to facilitate a rapid, enhanced cellular entry and delivery of conjugated compounds. The dendrimer-insulin conjugate acts as a transport mechanism that enables insulin to enter the cells of the gut lining. Polyol’s numerous functional groups make it conducive to conjugation with further moieties such as PEG-grafts, glutaric, fumaric, and sebacic acids, and protease inhibitors. These moieties protect insulin from the degradatory enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract, ensure its enteric ability, and increase its circulation time. The conjugate’s size allows it to be encapsulated in protective, bioadhesive microspheres proven to facilitate an 11.4% bioavailability. Along with the targeting moieties, the encapsulated conjugate may enhance this bioavailability rate to the extent that an efficient oral insulin pill could be developed. Additionally, the conjugates can enhance the effectivity of delivery via invasive methods and can localize in the cell, releasing the drug over time, perhaps making less shots necessary daily for Type 1 diabetics.

THE EFFECT OF PARENTAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS ON THE PHENYLALANINE LEVELS OF INFANTS WITH PHENYKETONURIA (PKU)
Michelle Horng
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR, USA

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a recessive genetic disorder that results in the body’s inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine (PHE). Toxic build-up of PHE in the brain gradually causes mental retardation in the patient. This, however, can be avoided by following a PHE-reduced diet. <br><br> It is believed that infants raised within lower social economic households will experience more abnormal plasma PHE levels. This study aims to define whether parental social economic status influences the plasma PHE level of PKU infants. <br><br> The study uses data of 15 randomly chosen PKU patients whose plasma PHE levels were monitored for the first 12-18 months of life using quantitative blood spots. Statistical analysis showed that PHE levels of patients from lower social economic situations stayed within the optimal range (2-6 mg/dL) 65.2±16.0% of the time, and that the PHE levels of patients from higher social economic situations stayed within the range 59.5±17.0% of the time.<br><br> The difference in data from the two groups are shown to be clinically insignificant, as p>0.05. This suggests that social economic status is not significant in relation to success in maintaining optimal PHE levels in infants with PKU; rather, the data suggests that parental compliancy and understanding of the PHE-reduced diet is the major factor in maintaining optimal PHE level ranges. <br><br> Further research is needed to explore diet therapy compliance in order to better educate parents of PKU children and minimize the severity of mental retardation.<br><br> This study will continue through early May to significantly increase sample size. <br><br>

GENE THERAPY MEETS CHEMOTHERAPY: EXPOSURE OF MALIGNANT GLIOMA CELLS TO TRANSGENIC EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND TEMOZOLOMIDE
Milana Zaurova
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, New York, USA

Malignant glioma kills more than half of its victims within two years of diagnosis, and recurs even after radical surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. This study investigates the pro-apoptotic effects of exposing human glioma cells to cellular vectors expressing transgenic Tumor Necrosis Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ). After testing sensitivity of A172, U87MG & U343 glioma cells to exogenous TRAIL alone, they were found to be sensitive, semi sensitive and non-sensitive, respectively. Co-exposure of tumor cells to soluble TRAIL and TMZ doubled the amount of U87 cell death when compared to TRAIL alone. Tumor cell death was measured using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) with a TRAIL-gene insert, doxycycline inducible TRAIL expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells was confirmed using RT-PCR and immuno-labelling. U87MG glioma cells were co-cultured with undifferentiated TRAIL- expressing ES cells both after pretreatment of the glioma with TMZ and without pretreatment. Results show that transgenic ES cells can be used as gene therapy vectors to deliver regulated, TRAIL to human glioma cells in vitro, killing the same amount of tumor cells as exogenous TRAIL. Co-cultures performed after the glioma cells were pretreated with TMZ yielded nearly double the tumor cell death of those without pretreatment. Finally, fully differentiated ES-derived astrocytes expressing TRAIL were co-cultured with Jurkat human tumor cells, killing more Jurkat cells than exogenous TRAIL and providing many clinical advantages over current treatments.

PROLONGED EFFECTS OF RADIO FREQUENCY RADIATION EXPOSURE ARE CELL PHONES AND RADAR GUNS SAFE?
Danna Elisabeth Thomas
Broadneck Senior High School, Annapolis Maryland, USA

There are nearly 170 million wireless subscribers in the US, including many young adults. Since widespread cellular phone use it little more than a decade old, there has been limited opportunity to examine its long-term health effects. There is also a growing concern about the occupational exposure of police officers to microwave radiation form traffic radar devices. <br><br>The goal of my experiment was to show whether or not exposure to different band of Microwave Radio Frequency (RF) Radiation would cause mutations to occur in Drosophilae. <br><br>In my experiment I exposed five generations of Drosophilae to 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 24 GHz Radio Frequency Radiation. These microwaves are common radio frequencies for cell phones, cordless phones, and radar guns today. I also maintained a Control vial of Drosophilae not exposed to radio frequency radiation. <br><br>I observed wing mutations in all five generations of RF exposed test cultures. Applying a test of statistical significance, I was able to support my hypothesis that RF Radiation does increase the likelihood of a mutation. <br><br>If a simple fruit fly mutates, could it be possible that RF Radiation emitted from cell phones and radar guns is harmful to human users?<br><br>According to the 1993 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health feasibility assessment, police officers are at a greater risk than the general population for any number of adverse health outcomes. Police Officers can reduce the potential risks of RF Radiation by using the radar gun lead covering when a radar gun is turned on.

SIGNIFICANCE OF M. TUBERCULOSIS LIPOPROTEIN PROCESSING IN TLR2 STIMULATION, MACROPHAGE PROINFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, AND MYCOBACTERIAL GROWTH
Jacob Hill Bagley
Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York, USA

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, is the single leading infectious cause of death in the world. One reason for the remarkable virulence of M.tb is its ability to persist in antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, by inhibiting their activation. The role of membrane-associated M.tb lipoproteins in inhibiting macrophage activation has not been characterized. I sought to characterize an M.tb mutant that lacks Lipoprotein Signal Peptidase (LspA), an enzyme that cleaves the signal peptide from M.tb prolipoproteins during lipoprotein processing. Without this enzyme, full lipoprotein processing does not occur. I examined the M.tb mutant’s growth in vitro and assayed murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells for proinflammatory response after treatment with the mutant M.tb and wild-type M.tb. I also characterized the stimulation of Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, which were made to express Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), after they were treated with the mutant and wild-type M.tb. TLR2, which is displayed on antigen-presenting cells, recognizes lipoproteins and, when stimulated, causes the increased expression of various cytokines. I found that LspA is necessary for normal growth of M.tb in vitro, that absence of LspA does not affect M.tb-induced RAW cell proinflammatory response, and that LspA is essential for TLR2 stimulation. These findings are significant to the pursuit of fully characterizing M.tb-macrophage interactions.

EFFECTS OF KAVA AND ALCOHOL ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY OF DAPHNIA MAGNA
Parth S Vyas
William L. Dickinson, Jersey City,NJ,United States

Kava,which grows throughout the Pacific Islands, was used by Polynesians in religeous ceremonies and now as an antidepressant. Because of its current popularity as a rereational drug, there is rising concern about its health effects when taken with alcohol. The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of Kava on the heart rate of Daphnia magna. It was hypothesized that if Kava is consumed with alcohol, it may result in significant loss of heart rate. A pilot study was conducted to test the optimal concentrations of Kava and alcohol. Heart rates of Daphnia were measured for 10 seconds before and after the substances were administered. The mean heart rates were-for Kava(180 BPM), Kava and Alcohol(150 BPM),and for neither (215 BPM). Several uncorrelated t-Tests were used to determine significance for these heart rates. For Kava and Kava with alcohol the calculated t of 6.16>2.878(p>0.001); for Kava and alcohol solution compared with alcohol the calculated t of 1.47<2.878 and not significant; and for separate solutions of Kava and alcohol, a calculated t of 1.68<2.878 and not significant. The results of this study show that although Kava decreases heart rate it is not of critical significance. However when Kava is taken with alcohol, the combined effects on the heart rate is shown to be dangerous and may have serious health consequences. The research hypothesis that a mixed solution of kava and alcohol will significantly reduce Daphnia's heart rate to a minimum level is fully supported.

THE EFFECTS OF BETASERON AND PYCNOGENOL ON NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CELLS
Katie Joy Nicholas
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA

It was hypothesized that both Betaseron and Pycnogenol would effectively reduce the NO levels of G-3-5 cells (CRL-2252, ATCC) which were taken from MS patients at autopsy.<br><br> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system. For an unknown reason, the body’s cells attack the myelin sheath that protects various nerve fibers. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in MS is still debated, but it may play a role in the destruction of the myelin sheaths. Two somewhat controversial MS treatments (Betaseron and Pycnogenol) were tested for their ability to reduce NO levels in G-3-5 cells.<br><br> Over a time period of three weeks, Betaseron and Pycnogenol were administered to G-3-5 cells in 24-well culture plates (using Random Complete Block), each at four different appropriate concentration to test dose response. A single culture plate was utilized to test alpha lipoic acid (ALA) in a repetition to compare to previous research. Absorption of the samples and Greiss reagent was read at 550 nm and NO levels were calculated in ìM nitrite from the standard curve. <br><br> The untreated cells were compared to cells treated with Betaseron and Pycnogenol and a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001 to p < 0.05) of NO was observed with each chemical treatment. Exposure time was not a factor and dose effect was not significant. This study indicates that Betaseron and Pycnogenol are both effective treatments to reduce NO levels in G-3-5 cells and may be effective treatments for MS patients.<br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF THE RISK REDUCTION OF TRANSMISSION OF NOSOCOMIAL PATHOGENS WITH THE APPLICATION OF SELECTED ANTISEPTIC AGENTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Louis Paul Derousie
Orange Park High School, Orange Park, Florida U.S.A.

Nosocomial infections with the pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylocccocus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have escalated in epidemic proportions in the last decade. Strategies to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens from patient to patient are crucial in the healthcare setting. Failure to control the spread of MRSA and VRE via contact increases the probability of the emergence of the lethal pathogen vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) <br><br>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of wet wiping latex tourniquets and non-latex stethoscope tubing with a selected antiseptic agent after inoculation with either Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus .faecalis. Four antiseptic agents were used: benzalkonium chloride(1:285), 4% chlorohexidine gluconate, 3% hydrogen peroxide, 62% ethyl alcohol. After a wet wipe with an antiseptic agent, tourniquet sections previously inoculated with S .aureus yielded positive growth 16% (25/160); stethoscope tubing previously inoculated with S .aureus yielded positive growth 20% (32/160). After a wet wipe with an antiseptic agent tourniquet sections previously inoculated with E .faecalis yielded positive growth 17% (27/160); stethoscope tubing previous inoculated with E .faecalis yielded positive growth 17 % (27/160). The efficacy of using an antiseptic agent on the environmental surfaces of latex tourniquets or non-latex stethoscope tubing was 83% (529/640) “no growth” <br><br>This study supports the hypothesis of risk reduction of nosocomial pathogens with the application of selected antiseptic agents on environmental surfaces. Recommendations are that stethoscopes and tourniquets be wet-wiped with an antiseptic agent after patient contact to reduce the transmission of antibiotic resistant organisms in the healthcare setting.<br><br>

IMPLICATION OF NICOTINE'S PRO-ANGIOGENESIS ACTIVITY: THE GOOD AND THE BAD
Sarah S. Mousa
Columbia High School, East Greenbush, NY, USA

The present study examined the mechanisms and the effects of nicotine on angiogenesis-mediated processes and its impact on tumor growth and wound healing. Nicotine demonstrated potent and significant (P<0.01) stimulation of the release of endothelial cell (EC) basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) but not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Nicotine in a concentration-dependent manner induced EC tube formation (P < 0.01) that is comparable to bFGF. In the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of angiogenesis, Nicotine effectively-induced the generation of new blood vessels (P <0.01), an effect that is comparable to the pro-angiogenesis growth factor bFGF or VEGF. Nicotine's pro-angiogenesis effect is shown to be mediated via bFGF as evident from the blockade by the bFGF polyclonal antibody. Additionally, the effects of nicotine on either EC release of bFGF or angiogenesis was maximally blocked (P < 0.01) by either anti-integrin alpha v beta 3 or inhibitor of the intracellular Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In the CAM tumor implant model, nicotine doubled (P < 0.01) the growth rate of breast, colon and lung cancer. These data indicated that nicotine has an endothelial cell stimulating effect resulting in enhanced angiogenesis mediated via FGF2 that is induced through the integrin alpha v beta 3 and MAPK. These data suggest a potential adverse effect of nicotine in cancer patients. In contrast, the pro-angiogenesis impact of Nicotine on wound healing was determined in an in vitro scratch wound healing assay using human dermal cells. Nicotine demonstrated effective stimulation (P < 0.01) of wound healing as compared to control. This represent potential benefit in using topical but not systemic nicotine or its polymeric form in improving wound healing in diabetics or patients with foot ulcer, without its potential adverse effect in promoting tumor growth or metastasis.<br><br>

IMMUNOSTIMULATION THROUGH NF-KB ACTIVATED CYTOKINE SYNTHESIS FROM AN HERBAL POLYSACCHARIDE FROM TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA
Reshma Ramachandran
Coral Reef Senior High School, Miami, FL, USA

RR-1, a novel (1,4)-(alpha)-D-glucan, is the active ingredient within Tinospora cordifolia, an ayurvedic herb known to have immune stimulating properties. To further explore these properties of RR-1, its effect on the biochemical pathways associated with monocyte/macrophage activation in RAW 264.7 mouse monocytes was investigated. When mouse monocytes are treated with RR1 (0 - 1000 µg/ml), a dose dependent increase in the synthesis of TNF-(alpha) was noticed, which could be completely inhibited by the NF-kB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). RR1 induced a 60% increase in NF-kB activation reaching a plateau at 500 µg/ml concentration. The time course experiment showed NF-kB activity peaking at approximately 8 h after treatment beyond which the activity started declining in RR1-treated monocytes. Phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of I-kB(alpha)occurred about 30 min after RR1 treatment of monocytes. RR1 does not upregulate the transcription of complement receptor 3 (CR3) and toll-like receptors (TLR2, 4 or 6). Incubation of monocytes with RR1 at 37°C followed by fluorescein-conjugated Zymosan A bioparticles do not very much alter the phagocytosis intensity of bioparticles. However, non-opsonized binding of fluorescein-conjugated Zymosan A bioparticles is significantly inhibited by pre-incubation of mouse monocytes with RR1 at 4°C. The inhibition of Dectin-1 receptor that is involved in the non-opsonized binding of polysaccharides significantly reduced RR1-activated TNF-(alpha) synthesis. These results suggest that the novel (1,4)-(alpha)-D-glucan from Tinospora cordifolia induces monocyte/macrophage activation, stimulating the synthesis of cytokines through Dectin-1 signaling, I-kB(alpha) degradation, and NF-kB activation, showing its clinical potential for biodefense and treatment of human diseases.

IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF SUGAR SUBSTITUTE MUTAGENICITY VIA A MOUSE LYMPHOMA THYMIDINE KINASE GENE MUTATION ASSAY
Kaleb Markus Naegeli
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, United States of America

The purpose was to evaluate mutagenic properties of sugar and its substitutes - aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and stevia (with and without maltodextrin) - on a mouse lymphoma cell culture. Cells were treated with methotrexate to kill TK-/- spontaneous mutants. The cells at a concentration of 10^6 cells/mL were placed in aliquots of 0.6 mL and received 0.4 mL RPMI1640 (w/5% bovine serum) or 0.4 mL S9 metabolic activator. Ten µL sweetener solution at concentrations of 5000, 2500, and 630µg/mL were added to the cell culture. These sweetener concentrations were approximately equivalent to the amount of sugar substitute in one, four, and eight diet sodas. After 24 hours incubation at 37 degrees Celsius, the cells were washed and incubated for 48 hours to express TK-/- mutants. The cells were then plated in twenty-four well plates (six wells/sweetener for replication) and received 1µL of trifluorothymidine to kill all normal TK+/- cells. After twelve days incubation, colonies of mutated cells were counted. When results were counted, aspartame, saccharin, and pure stevia (at concentrations of 630, 630, and 5000µg/mL respectively), yielded statistically significant decreases in cellular growth. Aspartame caused a significant decrease of 53.1% in cellular growth at 630µg/mL (t-test=2.780>t.05=1.8046). At all three concentrations, saccharin caused significant or highly significant numbers of TK-/- mutants (t-test=4.470>t.01=3.25) (t-test=2.490>t.05=2.26) (t-test=7.50>t.001=5.41). Sucralose yielded significant numbers of mutants without metabolic activation at 5000 and 2500 µg/mL. Stevia caused a statistically significant decrease in mutated colonies (t-test=2.320>t.05=1.8331). Saccharin and sucralose showed potential mutagenicity and stevia lowered mutagenicity while aspartame inhibited cell growth.

THE CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF FRANKINCENSE OIL IN MALIGNANT GLIOBLASTOMA: A MECHANISTIC APPROACH
Carrie Elizabeth Shaw
Career Center, Winston-Salem NC, USA 

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive type of malignant brain tumor, has a 5-year survival rate of <3%. Because there have been no major advances in the treatment of GBM in over 30 years, it is imperative that new strategies are developed. Thirty one to 84% of cancer patients use complementary therapies. One such therapy, use of essential oils, are oils extracted from plants using a steam distillation process. This project tested the cytotoxic and mechanistic effects of frankincense oil in GBM and normal brain cells. <br><br> Using the MTT cell proliferation assay, cytotoxicity of frankincense oil in SNB19 human GBM, C-6 rat GBM, and normal rat astrocyte cell lines was evaluated. Cells were treated with 0.0 to 0.2 µg/mL frankincense oil in 0.05 µg/mL increments. At a frankincense oil concentration of 0.2 µg/mL, 100% of SNB19 and C-6 GBM cells were killed, compared to only 20% of normal rat astrocytes, a “therapeutic ratio” of 4:1. To determine whether frankincense killed brain tumor cells by apoptosis (programmed cell death), western blotting was performed, probing for cleaved caspase-3. Caspase-3, an activator of apoptosis, is cleaved only when cells undergo apoptosis. As frankincense oil concentration increased, SNB19 and C-6 GBM cells showed an increase in caspase-3 cleavage while no caspase-3 cleavage was detected in normal rat astrocytes.<br><br> Future studies will determine possible synergistic effects of essential oils in combination with standard cancer treatments. In addition, topical frankincense is being tested in animals with skin cancer at a regional veterinary school’s oncology program. <br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF NICOTINE AND ITS IMPACT ON LEARNING: POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE ON CYPIN GENERATED NEURONAL BRANCHING
Myriah Lynn Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull Wyoming, USA

This research investigates the enzyme, Cypin. Cypin is a seldom-researched brain enzyme. It was discovered in 1999 in the hippocampus. Cypin controls neuron branching, which theoretically affects learning. Experimentation concentrated on the impact of various nicotine concentrations on the production of Cypin in tissue cultures. Lower levels of Cypin were expression, indicate less neuron branching, which could result in reduced learning potential.<br><br> To analyze the affect of nicotine on Cypin, PC-12 cells were exposed in-vitro to daily nicotine concentrations of 0.4 mg/L to 7.2 mg/L. After treatment, cells were processed using primary and secondary antibody ICC. Stained cells were observed for expression of Cypin using photomicroscopy. Counts were recorded for all slides.<br><br> From the results that have been collected from this experimentation, it can be concluded that nicotine possesses a strong potential to affect learning. Cypin expression after nicotine addition showed that neuronal branching decreased. This effect is probably most detrimental in young children and infants who are experiencing higher levels of neuronal development. As a result of decreased neuronal branching, the ability to learn would also decrease. <br><br> However, the decreases in Cypin expression were not linear in relation to concentration. This would suggest that even small amounts of nicotine could produce a similar impact. Reduction of Cypin ranged as high as 50%.<br><br> Further investigation will center on more specific nicotine concentrations that better identify effects on a “per-cigarette” or similar basis and on verification of initial experimentation. <br><br>

CAN LASERS BE USED TO MEASURE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS?
Julie Krystine Loza
Kouts High School, Kouts IN, United States

Blood glucose testing has always been a necessary, but problematic task. In order to alleviate the usual pain inflicted when a diabetic tests his blood sugar, I used a laser and the laser light’s polarizing properties to measure blood glucose levels painlessly. An amplifying circuit with a sensor showed at what rotation the most light went through the polarizing filters. This amount of rotation is the amount the laser light rotated. The amount of light rotation varies directly with the blood glucose level, so that was how I was able to measure the blood glucose levels. I found that the laser light rotated less with high glucose levels, opposite of the way it should be. Another noted outcome is that the samples taken from the high glucose levels were less variable than the samples taken from the low glucose levels. I concluded that with better, more precise materials, blood glucose levels can be measured with a laser.

THE ROLE OF HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL CELL SPECIFIC GENE IN NEUTROPHIL INFLAMMATION
Saranya Sathananthan
Martin Luther King Academic Magnet, Nashville Tennessee, USA

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, and occurs not only during embryogenesis and wound healing but also during the development of tumors, and many other diseases. Understanding the processes of angiogenesis and the factors that influence it is important for the advancement of angiogenesis therapies, which are currently being used to treat various tumors and cancers. Inflammation, the body’s response to cellular injury resulting in the migration of white blood cells to the injured region, is one aspect of angiogenesis. Human Endothelial Cell Specific Gene (HES), a recently discovered gene was found to be linked with the inflammation process and indications are that HES may be involved with neutrophil inflammation, the attraction of neutrophils to endothelial cells. A cell adhesion assay was done to determine whether HES controlled neutrophil inflammation. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)were infected with pAdeno HES and were assayed for their ability to attract HL60 neutrophils. Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory factor that induces inflammation, was used as a positive control to verify the assay. When inflammation occurs, inflammatory agents are released into the blood stream to cause neutrophils to migrate toward the endothelial cells at the injured site. An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was done in order to determine whether the HES protein was released into the media to attract the HL60 neutrophils. The ELISA results indicated that HES was not released into the media. These results suggest that HES does not control this type of inflammation.

IMPROVING CANCER TREATMENT THROUGH TELOMERASE INHIBITION
Jimmy Chen Yang
Plano Senior High School, Plano, Texas, U.S.A.

Telomerase allows for replicative immortality and is believed to be activated as part of most cancer progression. Correspondingly, telomerase inhibitors are being developed and tested for cancer treatment. However, one of the disadvantages to this treatment is the time required to be effective. This study investigates the possibility of sensitizing lung cancer cells to radiation therapy by reducing the expression of telomerase. Ultimately, synergistic cancer cell death is sought by decreasing the probable protective effects of telomerase. In order to determine if synergistic cell death could be achieved, telomerase was inhibited by using a modified oligonucleotide inhibitor, and cells were treated in conjunction with radiation. Cell death was quantified by obtaining cell counts and cell death percentages in a cell population study and by counting cell colonies in a colony formation assay and a soft agar assay. Afterward, percent inhibition calculations were conducted. With telomerase inhibition, synergistic cell death was found in certain cases of all of the assays when the inhibitors were combined with radiation. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the differences among the groups were significant, with p<0.0005. Furthermore, use of the telomerase inhibitor was able to enhance the percent inhibition by 15-25%. As a result, telomerase inhibition may hold potential in enhancing the effects of radiation therapies in combined treatment strategies. These results suggest that telomerase plays a role in protecting cancer cells from treatment and conveys the implications of combining telomerase inhibitors in treatment for patients.

THE CORRELATION WITH HYPOXIA INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1ALPHA AND THE REDUCTION IN MALIGNANT TUMOR GROWTH.
Andrew Allen Gilbert
North Utah Academy for Math, Eng. & Science, Ogden, Utah, USA

Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression has been demonstrated in malignant Gliomas. VEGF is regulated by the transcription factor HIF-1ALPHA under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a DNA-binding complex composed of two subunits, HIF-1ALPHA and -1BETA. We introduced an environment of HIF-1ALPHA, in order to reduce the growth of new cells in the tumors through mitosis. To do this we applied a liquefied form of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1ALPHA, and allowed the tumor to grow in DPBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline) for exactly one (1) week. We then compared the tumor growth to the controls, the blind tests and the know variable. The averages for the tumor growths are as follows: the tumors with HIF-1ALPHA had an average growth of 6.5%, while the non-hypoxic tumors had, on average, 13.65% new cellular growth. My conclusion is that the HIF-1ALPHA environment was very successful against the new tumor growth and against deteriorating the VEGF levels. The cellular growth was cut by approximately 50% and the VEGF levels were cut to 25% of their original status. We also observed shrinking of the blood vessels in the tumor, reducing strain on the body by reducing the amount of blood needed for the tumor to survive. <br><br>

THE NUEROCHEMICAL EFFECT OF DIABETES ON PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Joshua Edward Tripp
Sheridan High School, Sheridan, Arkansas, United States of America

This project examines the neurochemical effects of diabetes on Parkinson’s disease (PD). The neurochemical effects of PD can be simulated in PC12 cell cultures by exposing them to the neurotoxin MPP+. This reduces the amount of dopamine present inside the cell. Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the dopaminergic system and amounts of dopamine are decreased in brains of people with PD. Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin resulting in fluctuations in blood glucose. <br><br> PC12 cells were exposed to different glucose environments (high, normal and low) to simulate diabetes. PC12 cells were exposed to MPP+ in these different glucose environments to simulate the combination of diabetes and PD. After 24 hours of exposure the cells were washed, followed by an extraction procedure to remove the neurotransmitters from the cell prior to injection into an HPLC system to measure the amounts of dopamine and DOPAC, which is a metabolite of dopamine. <br><br>The amounts of dopamine and DOPAC in the groups exposed to the different concentrations of glucose were not different. However, all the groups exposed to MPP+ had significantly lower amounts of dopamine and DOPAC. The group with high glucose and MPP+ had slightly higher dopamine than the normal with MPP+. The cells with low glucose had less dopamine. These results indicate that low glucose in the brain may make the effects of PD more severe. <br><br>

CHARACTERIZATATION OF BONE MARROW-DERIVED STEM CELLS
Janet Wing Yui Li
Wayzata High School, Plymouth MN, USA

The most integral part of a stem cell study is the verification of the cells of interest as stem cells. This study used three analytical tools, quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing (Q-PCR), fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), and immunofluorescent staining, to document the regulation of three genes and six proteins in two populations of Rhesus monkey bone marrow-derived cells.<br><br>Both lines, RG1000 and RK0, began culture plated at 500 cells/cm2 and 1000 cells/cm2, but the RG1000 cells plated at 500 cells/cm2 and the RK0 cells plated at 1000 cells/cm2 began to die out by differentiating into fibroblastic-like cells. Thus, the two cell lines exhibit different survival characteristics. Results from the Q-PCR analysis and verification by immunofluorescent staining show the upregulation of genes Oct3a and Ddx4 in both lines of cells. Nanog was minimally present. In the FACS analysis, a CD44 phenotype was in both cell lines; however, CD106 is found only on the RK0 line. The most likely explanation is the density differences when growing the cell lines. The lower density RK0 cells seem to produce a classical mesenchymal stem cell phenotype (CD44 positive, CD45 negative, CD106 positive, MHCI positive, MHCII negative) while the higher density RG1000 cells produce a phenotype more common to a multipotent adult progenitor cell (CD44 low positive, CD45 negative, MHCI low positive, MHCII negative, CD106 negative).<br><br>It can be concluded that the cells were at least mesenchymal stem cells. Further testing on the multipotency, via differentiations of these cells, will reveal the true differentiation potential of the cells.<br><br>

CORD BLOOD STEM CELLS ALTER CYTOKINES IN THE BLOOD AND THYMUS AFTER A STROKE.
Justus Roberts II
Paul R. Wharton High School, Tampa, Florida, USA

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a change in the amount of inflammatory proteins, cytokines, expressed in the peripheral blood and the thymus cells after an induced stroke and whether CB stem cells altered this expression. <br><br>METHODS: This experiment utilized blood and thymus cells from rats that were normal, stroked, and stroked and transplanted with Cord Blood (CB) stem cells. The cells were cultured and the amount of cytokine secreted was determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Absorbant Assay (ELISA). Some of the thymuses were cut to thin slices mounted on slides and immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokine expression. <br><br>RESULTS: The results showed that when a victim has a stroke and has been injected with CB stem cells, then the pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased and the anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in the blood and thymus, which benefits the stroke victim. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The results obtained supported the researcher’s hypothesis, because the CB stem cells that were administered to stroked rats did reduce the ability of the rats’ peripheral blood and thymus cells to produce the inflammatory cytokines. The potential impact or contribution this research may have on the broad field of medicine is that strokes are the third leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Hopefully, with these results, CB stem cells can be used as a treatment for stroke victims.

ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE INDUCES DEATH OF ALVEOLAR CANCER CELLS: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Poorav Kumar Rohatgi
Hillsborough High School IB, Tampa, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the Atrial Natriuretic Protein (ANP), which acts as a vasodilator within arteries, inhibits the NF-kB signal pathway, inducing apoptosis, or cell death in A549 alveolar cancer cells. In this experiment, ANP was confirmed to deactivate the NF-kB pathway through results from the Dual-Luciferase Assay, fluorescence microscopy, and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) analysis. Next, it was determined through the Fluorometric Tunel Assay that ANP induced apoptosis in the A549 cancer cells. Using this information, the researcher concluded that there was a direct correlation between the inhibition of the NF-kB pathway and the activation of apoptosis in the cells by using the Active Caspase-3 anitbody and Annexin-V assay in FACS. Finally, in order to best simulate the conditions within an organism, the researcher grew colonies of A549 cancer cells in soft agar and ascertained that the cells treated with ANP actually produced fewer colonies. These results may provide an approach for localized treatments of tumors.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF EARLY STAGES OF BREAST CANCER WITH MARKER CONNEXIN 43
Eugenia Gabrielov
West Lafayette Jr./Sr. High School, West Lafayette, IN, United States

Archival biopsy sections, anonymous to the researcher, of histologically certified classes of benign breast lesions, immunostained for protein Connexin 43 with horseradish peroxidase were obtained. The value of the protein as a marker of specific alterations of apical polarity was assessed by the relationship between the histological degree of polarity loss and connexin relocation. A consistent scoring method to evaluate potential cancerous changes was developed.<br><br> Two main parameters for histological grading of polarity loss were used in addition to usual histological classification which was already performed. The markers were the position of the nucleus (basal or not basal) within luminal epithelial cells and the degree of filling of the lumen (mono or multilayer epithelial cells or complete absence of a lumen). Size of nuclei and nuclear structure were analyzed for variance. The location of Connexin 43 was compared to each of these markers. Specific locations in the epithelium were classified as: (1) apical and basal location; (2) trace apical location; (3) basal location; and (4) undeterminable staining.<br><br> Non-cancerous slides, ductal hyperplasia slides, and a ductal carcinoma in situ slide were used for image capture at various magnifications. A scoring system of four symbols based on marker location in reference to the lumen was used to grade individual images. Numbers of marker locations in the form of percentages were recorded into statistical analysis program Prism 3.0. T-tests were performed to address the significance of the correlation between a specific distribution of Connexin 43 and a specific histological alteration. <br><br>

COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DUE TO EPILEPTIC FOCI IN THE NEOCORTEX
Max Lawrence Christie
Ossining High School, Ossining NY, USA

Previous research has shown that epileptic activity in the brain can cause impairment in cognitive skills. This study attempted to determine if epileptic activity specific to the neocortex would cause cognitive impairments in the developing brain. Experimental rats were kindled to induce an epileptic focus and were placed through behavioral tests: a balance beam, an elevated plus maze, and an open field test. Experimental and control rats spent comparable times on the balance beam (Experimental, Mean=71.2 sec, Control, Mean=79.7 sec). However experimental rats took almost twice as long to reach the closed arm of the elevated plus maze (Experimental, Mean=49.7 sec, Control, Mean=27.5 sec; P=.060) and exhibited signs of perseveration during the third period of the open field test (Experimental, Mean=157.0 sec, Control, Mean=94.9 sec; P=.028). Experimental rats showed an increase in the length of seizure duration (Stimulation #1 Mean=6.61sec., Stimulation #15 Mean=15.47 sec., Stimulation #30 Mean=23.84 sec.) and the behavioral seizure stage as a function of the stimulation number. These results suggest that epileptic activity in the brain can cause a rewiring of neuronal architecture of the brain, disrupting normal activity associated with cognition.<br><br>

SCFC ANTIBODIES FOR THE THERAPY OF IGA NEPHROPATHY
Christina Eloisa Tartaglia
Rye Neck High School, Mamaroneck New York, USA

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a disease that may result from the production of abnormal IgA antibodies with fewer than normal galactoside sugar residues attached to their hinge regions. These aberrantly glycosylated antibodies may provoke an immune response leading to immune complex formation and deposit on kidney mesangium, which is a hallmark of the disease. In support of this hypothesis, HAA lectin binding was enhanced to IgA1 purified from IgAN patients. In addition, IgAN patients had varying levels of serum IgG reactivity to their own IgA1 and IgA1 from other IgAN patients. Furthermore, panning scFv libraries was conducted over purified patient IgA, and scFv that reacted to normal human IgA was absorbed out. A bacteriophage library, expressing approximately one hundred million different recombinant human single chain antibodies (scFv), was used as an antigen source for panning. By this approach we expect to isolate scFv that bind specifically to IgA from patients with IgA nephropathy. Purified IgA from one or two IgAN patients with IgA/IgG complexes in their sera was chosen for panning. After panning and absorption, individual phage clones are tested in ELISA’s and immunoblot assays to identify scFv that bind specifically to patient IgA. ScFv with high specificity have potential for development as diagnostic and/or therapeutic reagents. <br><br>

CAN A NEW MEDICINE BE DISCOVERED IN A PLANT NATIVE TO MONTANA? A SUDY OF THE ENZYMATIC INHIBITION ACTIVITY IN PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS ISOLATED FROM YUCCA GLAUCA: PHASE II
Kels Gordon Phelps
Butte High School, Butte, Montana, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to isolate and identify the compounds in Yucca glauca responsible for signal transduction inhibition activity.<br><br>I began by combining several fractions produced from two C18 Reverse Phase Flash High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) columns on raw Yucca root extracted in methanol. These fractions were combined based upon signal transduction activity and the fact that their Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were very similar. One of these sets of fractions was separated using Countercurrent Chromatography. Another was separated using Flash Silica. A third set of fractions was divided using an LH-20 methanol column.<br><br>I examined NA 2-83 S and T, combined them and ran an HPLC which produced NA 2-101. Then, I ran another HPLC on NA 2-101 F producing NA 2-102. I ran an HPLC with TFA on NA 2-102 tube 25 which produced NA 2-103’s.<br><br>I examined NA 2-85 K/NA 2-93 B (methanol LH-20 of NA 2-79 D (methanol LH-20 of NA 2-7)) and found that it was highly active in inhibiting Caspase 1. I discovered that it was trans-3,3’,5,5’-tetrahydroxy-4’methoxystilbene. I then looked at NA 2-103 tubes 17 and 18. I determined that tube 17 contained a high concentration of Yuccaol A with some Yuccaol C. Tube 18 contained Yuccaol A and Yuccaol C.<br><br>I was able to identify the compounds responsible for signal transduction activity. Yuccaol C was by far the most active. Yuccaol C may be used to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS IN BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM
Samuel Phillips Lawrence
Alice Deal Junior High School, Washington DC, United States

The purpose of the present experiment was to explore, in rats, the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in behavior associated with autism. Efforts to understand autism have shown that individuals affected by autism have fewer acetylcholine receptors than the normal human brain. Nicotine is a neurotransmitter that activates acetylcholine receptors. By comparing the behavior of normal rats whose nervous systems have been injected with nicotine and, subsequently, injected with a nicotine antagonist, it is possible to explore whether the smaller number of active receptors in the brains of individuals with autism plays a role in their distinctive social, exploratory, and stereotypic behaviors. Each of four rats was tested under four conditions: (1) Control (no injection), (2) Saline solution (to control for effects of an injection), (3) Nicotine enhancement drug (to examine effects of increased levels of nicotine in the brain), and (4) Nicotine antagonist (to examine effects of decreased levels of nicotine in the brain). The rats' social, exploratory, and stereotypic behaviors were compared across these four conditions. The rats showed less social and exploratory behavior when their acetylcholine receptors were blocked by the nicotine antagonist than they did in the control and nicotine enhancement conditions. The rats also showed less stereotypic behavior in the nicotine enhancement condition than in the baseline condition. The results suggest that the smaller number of acetylcholine receptors found in the brains of individuals with autism may play a central role in the diminished social and exploratory, and increased stereotypic behaviors that characterize this disease.

THE EFFECT OF 670NM LED PHOTOBIOMODULATION ON THE GROWTH OF MITOCHONDRIAL MUTANT S. CEREVISIAE
Keely Ann Goodgame
San Jon High School, San Jon N.M., United States

<br><br>Therapeutic light-emitting diodes (LED) are a recent form of light therapy. This so called “photobiomodulation” has been shown to accelerate wound healing and to increase cell growth in tissue cultures. Both cell division and growth require energy produced through the cellular respiration occurring in mitochondria. Cytochrome-c oxidase, the terminal enzyme complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, creates the electrochemical gradient which provides the force to produce ATP (Capaldi, 1990). The theorized energizing of cytochrome complexes in the electron transport systems by the photobiomodulation have not been documented (Eells, et al., 2002). The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of a 670nm LED light on a S. cerevisiae strain deficient in mitochondrial DNA and a strain deficient in cytochrome-c oxidase subunit IV, to elucidate the theorized mode of action. S. cerevisiae is a well documented eukaryotic model with available mutant and wild-types to test specific cytochrome-c oxidase complexes. It was hypothesized that the 670nm LED light would improve the growth and longevity of both mutant strains. The wild-type and mutant yeast were photoirradiated with a 670nm LED light at 80seconds/4joules per cm2, 2X and 3X a day, using a Quantum© warp 10 light for a period of 86 hours. Colonies were counted at 12 hours, 24 hours, and 86 hours. The photobiomodulation significantly increased the growth and longevity of cytochrome-c oxidase subunit IV S. cerevisiae at both levels of irradiation, supporting the hypothesis. Further research should include a suitable model for a mitochondrial respiration deficient disease.<br><br>

OSTEOPOROSIS: A STUDY OF CALCIUM ABSORPTION AND DEPLETION IN ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS BONE.
Lacy Beth Casteel
Brooks High School, Killen Alabama, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to study the differences in calcium absorption and depletion within various beverages and calcium supplements. The supplements used were Tums, Coral Calcium, Calcium Citrate, Oyster Shell Calcium, and Calcium Hydroxyapatite; while the beverages used were Water, Orange Juice, Coca Cola, Milo’s Sweet Tea, and Papst Blue Ribbon Beer.<br><br> It was hypothesized the Coca Cola would be the most destructive to the bones used in the experiment, while Calcium Citrate would be the best supplement choice because of solubility factors.<br><br> Solutions were prepared using each supplement dissolved in the different beverages. Odocoileus virginianus (White Tail Deer Bones) were massed before and after soaking in the solution. A calcium probe was used to determine the level of calcium in the solutions before and after the soaking. The pH of the solutions was also measured. When the calcium probe appeared inaccurate, a series of EDTA Titrations were performed to determine the amount of calcium contained within each solution.<br><br> The results of this experiment show that; in fact, Coca Cola and Orange Juice adversely affected the amount of calcium absorbed. Contrary to the hypothesis, the brand of calcium supplement seemed to make little difference in the task of preventing calcium depletion. However, the data indicates Coral Calcium and Oyster Shell Calcium are slightly more effective. The pH values taken during this experiment remained fairly constant; however, after the soaking period, the pH increased.<br><br>

THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF SEROTONIN PRECURSOR LOADING TO MITIGATE MDMA-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY: RESCUE OF SEROTONIN NEURONS AND TREATMENT OF ANXIOGENESIS
Diana Lynn Eheart
Hamilton High School, Chandler, Arizona, United States

+/- 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) use has dramatically increased among teenagers and young adults in recent years. MDMA depletes levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), which leads to anxiety, depression, and aggression during withdrawal. It was hypothesized that the 5-HT precursor, L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) will prevent 5-HT neurotoxicity after chronic MDMA exposure. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered neurotoxic doses of MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p.), fenfluramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or control saline injections (1 ml/kg, i.p.), twice daily over four consecutive days. Four days later, these three treatment groups were subdivided to receive the serotonin precursor L-5-HTP (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or sesame oil vehicle (1 ml/kg, i.p.), once daily for two days. Two days later, all rats were assessed for anxiety, using the light/dark box, elevated plus maze, and open field. Following the monoamine assay of brain tissue, results indicate that males and females suffered from MDMA-induced neurotoxicity in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and striatum, which are the main brain structures in emotionality, learning, and memory. There were no measurable anxiogenic effects at one week following neurotoxic exposure to MDMA. Motor activity was increased in MDMA-treated rats, and this was reversed by L-5-HTP treatment. Gender differences were also found. Overall, females showed less anxiety than males as expressed by increased activity. Chronic MDMA exposure was more neurotoxic to females than males. L-5HTP treatment was effective in rescuing 5-HT neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala of males and the striatum in females.

EFFECTS OF CHOLESTEROL TREATMENT WITH TEA ON MICE
Claudia Titze Hessel

One of the modern nutrition problems is the high consumption of fat. They cause gradual increase of free radicals in the organism, which are responsible for oxidative stress and degenerative diseases. Many people look for natural solutions using medicinal plants. Nowadays these studies allow us to make researches that can help us know better those plants and the therapeutic power of their substances, which are called active principle.<br><br> The potential of many plants is already known, and some plants are used for manufacturing medicines. For this research, I used: Ginger(Zingibes officinalis ) , Green tea(Camelia sinensis), arqueja tea (Baccharis trimera), Chapeu de Couro – Leather Hat - tea(Echinodorus macrophillus). These plants have flavonoids, which are antioxidant substances that help reduce oxidative stress. This research’s’ goal is to verify if the plants can contribute to the reduction of lipid per oxidation effects on mice metabolism.<br><br>I used knock out mice for this research, as the receivers of cellular cholesterol gene, which were imbued with hiper-cholestemie, by feeding them with cholesterol supplement ration, and submitted to a tea ingestion diet.<br><br> I analyzed the mice tissue, with the TBA-RS process, and their Protein Dosage, using the Bradford Method. The data collected showed that tea ingestion helped positively the reduction of the oxidative stress in heart, brain and liver tissue.<br><br>

MEK5-ERK5 SIGNAL PATHWAYS IN ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANCE IN BREAST CANCER
Patricia Tsai
Benjamin Franklin Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States

This project arose in response to a heightened concern for the dangers of antiestrogen resistance and aimed to identify CA Mek5’s role in antiestrogen resistance. It was hypothesized that cells transfected with CA Mek5 would not remain relatively stable in the presence of estrogen, ICI 182,780, and Tamoxifen.<br><br>One group of MCF7-N cells was transfected with CA Mek5, while a second group was not. Cells were given estrogen, ICI, and Tamoxifen in controlled amounts. In ERE-luciferase assay, a luminometer measured protein concentrations. RT-PCR visualized PCR products using ethidium bromide staining; Western blot analysis used a chemiluminescence system to detect proteins. In MTT Cell Proliferation Assay, the amount of color produced by the cells varied directly to cell numbers.<br><br>The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis. Protein concentrations measured by the luminometer showed that MCF7-N cells without CA Mek5 grew 40x in the presence of estrogen, while CA Mek5 cells increased by 2x. MCF7-N cells generally decreased in response to chemical treatment. For CA Mek5 cells, however, growth was more defined, even in the presence of chemical treatment. Results for RT-PCR, Western blot, and MTT Assay provided supportive evidence. MCF7-N cells were more responsive to estrogen and chemical treatment than were CA Mek5 cells.<br><br>Hopefully, more people will become aware of anti-estrogen resistance as a result of this experiment and spur increased research in this area of breast cancer. Further investigation(s) include isolating an enzyme or catalyst that will interfere with CA Mek5’s chemical pathways.<br><br>

PREVENTING DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS THROUGH ENDOTHELIAL CELL RESEARCH
Mark G. Evans
Hillcrest High School Midvale, Utah, U.S.A.

Diabetic complications stem from high concentrations of blood glucose, which are known to adversely affect endothelial cells that line blood vessels. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as an intracellular energy sensor and may play a role in adjusting the body’s metabolism in diabetes. My science project measured the endothelial cell AMPK activation in response to varying concentrations of extracellular glucose. Endothelial cell response to elevated glucose has not been studied. <br><br> Cultured bovine endothelial cells were prepared on eight plates. Different concentrations of glucose solutions (2-20 millimolar) were added to each of the cultures. The 5-millimolar concentration is considered the control, approximating normal human blood sugar levels. Ultrasound was used to free the proteins from the cell membranes. AMPK-antibody was added to bind and purify the AMPK protein. This AMPK is added to a peptide, a short chain of amino acids. One of these amino acids is phosphorylated by AMPK, and the amount of AMPK activity can be quantified by measuring radioactive(32 P) phosphate incorporation into the peptide. My results showed that high glucose inhibit AMPK activity. <br><br> This project discovered that in endothelial cells, AMPK activity decreases with increasing glucose concentrations. This will lead to fat accumulation in these cells, because lower AMPK activity will shut-off fat oxidation. In turn, fat accumulation in cells has been shown to damage those cells. Current or future diabetic pharmaceuticals, which increase AMPK activity, may protect the endothelial cells.<br><br>

USING VIRUSES TO KILL CANCER: INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF IN VITRO CELL DIFFERENTIATION IN HSV-1 DOUBLE-MUTANT KM110RED INFECTION OF HFOB AND U2OS CELLS
Natalie Mary Raso
St. Thomas More Secondary, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Oncolytic virus therapy is being investigated as a safer and more effective alternative to conventional cancer therapies. Double mutant Herpes Simplex Virus type I, KM110red (KM110r) is capable of killing osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells while not destroying undifferentiated normal human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) cells, however the genetic reasons for this differential response are unknown. This experiment was conducted to determine whether KM110r is an effective and safe oncolytic virus therapy by exploring its effects on U2OS and hFOB cells and to determine whether induced genetic differentiation alters the permissiveness of hFOB cells to KM110r. <br><br>U2OS cells, hFOB cells and co-cultures were infected. Immunofluorescent microscopy was employed to conduct proliferation assays over the course of 4 time periods. One thousand images were taken and the cells in each image were counted and analyzed, morphologically and statistically, to interpret the data. <br><br>The data showed that at 34°C and 37°C, KM110r eradicated 100% of the U2OS cells, but only 27% at 39°C. The significant practical application of this discovery is that as a cancer therapy, use of KM110r is optimal when administered at 37°C, or physiological body temperature. <br><br>hFOB cells grew at almost identical rates (as confirmed by student’s t-test, significance value >5%) regardless of status of infection at each incubation temperature and were not permissive to KM110r at any point during experimentation. This suggests that KM110r ignores non-cancerous cells despite differentiation. <br><br>The results confirm that KM110r is selectively oncolytic and is an effective and safe oncolytic virus therapy under normal conditions of cell growth and differentiation.

DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS FROM BONE MARROW STEM CELLS: AN ACCEPTABLE, POTENTIAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Sami Obaïd
Collège Regina Assumpta, Montréal, Québec, Canada

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disorder for which one known leading cause is the dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons. To date, there are no known effective treatments PD. One new promising approach for the treatment of PD consists with the replacement, via transplantation, of dopaminergic neurons derived from neural stem cells (NSC). However, one limiting factor is the accessibility and the small number of NSC that one can isolate from the brain. Another possible concern is whether transplanted neurons can produce sufficient dopamine to restore the affected functions. <br><br>The first objective of this experiment was to determine if functional NSC could be isolated from a more accessible and abundant source, the bone marrow. The second objective was to engineer these NSC to over-express dopamine by transducing them using an adenovirus. <br><br>NSC were isolated from adult rat bone marrow. The presence of NSC was confirmed by the expression of nestin. Rat brain NSC was used as control. Transduction of NSC with an adenovirus expressing the TH gene resulted with an increase in dopamine production following the differentiation. The presence of dopamine producing neurons was determined by TH immunostaining and by Western blot. Finally, dopamine over-expressing neurons could form functional synapses with control non-transduced neurons. <br><br>In conclusion, NSC could be isolated from the bone marrow and could be engineered to over-express dopamine. Therefore, this approach could help obtaining millions of dopaminergic neurons for the treatment of PD. Moreover, a similar approach could be applied for the treatment of other neuro-degenerative diseases.<br><br><br>

HOSTILE HABITAT: CAN THEY TAKE IT? HERBS III
Hannah Euphrates Woriax
Purnell Swett High School, Pembroke, NC 28372 (USA)

Rising medical costs and increased risks of side effects are forcing many people to return to the use of alternative sources of help for treatment of their medical quandaries. In earlier studies, this researcher examined extracts from herbs commonly used by Native American cultures. Initially, the antibiotic value of chosen herbs was tested against Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698) and Escherichia coli (Strain K 12, ATCC 14948), then compared against the activity of commercial antibiotics. In a second study, the effectiveness of the most potent herbs was tested in various combinations in an attempt to produce a better medicine than the herb alone.<br><br>The current project focused on the use of three herbal extracts -- Garlic, Goldenseal, and Sage -- for their antibiotic properties on E. coli or M. luteus at two pH environments and the preparation conditions used to formulate them. Results indicate that these herbs display a pH preference for bacterial inhibition, differing by bacterial strain. Secondly, all herbs were able to produce inhibition zones up to either 12 or 36 hours after preparation with E. coli and M. luteus respectively, after which the effect of Goldenseal and Sage began to diminish. However, Garlic has effectiveness in both strains through 30 days. Thirdly, when bacteria are grown over various time periods before application of herbal disks, the data indicate that the three herbs can function up to either 6 or 18 hours pre-growth with either E. coli or M. luteus, respectively. Commercial antibiotics displayed a similar pattern of inhibition. <br><br>

THE PASSIFLORA EDULIS AS MUSCULAR RELAXANT
Ivalany Hernández-López
CROEM School, Mayaguez, PR

The Passiflora edulis is very recognized in natural medicine. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if Passiflora edulis had a muscle relaxant effect when applied to an effected area as an ointment. In the experimentation, 350 mL of Passiflora edulis pulp and seeds were crushed and used to prepared an ointment which was made of wax, coconut oil and vaseline. This ointment was applied by a physical therapist to the experimental group. A placebo of the mixture was prepared with the same ingredient, except Passiflora edulis, for the control group. The sample used for this study consisted of 80 adults; 40 were on the control group, and 40 on the experimental group. The participants under-went a questionnaire before and after the treatment. The treatment consisted of a daily application of the ointment during a month period. The results showed that 88% of the control group confirmed that they felt no relief after the treatment, in comparison with 100% of the participants of the experimental group who confirmed that they felt total relief with the ointment. A second phase will be done to identify the components in the Passiflora edulis and find its relationship with commercial muscular relaxants if any.<br><br>

This project presents the use of the plant leaves known as Ludwigia octovalvis as a natural medicinal remedy for the control of bacterial infections caused by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro.<br><br>Different concentrations: 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 of the leave extract were prepared. Control discs were prepared with these concentrations and placed them into the Petri dish containing the bacteria. A negative control was prepared by using sterile distilled water on discs and a positive control (Ampicillin 1g) to prove the effectiveness of the obtained extract; by measuring the inhibition growth area. It was verified that the Ludwigia octovalvis leaves extract inhibited the bacterial growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae that cause skin ulcers and respiratory effects.<br><br>Different tests were performed, like paper chromatography and calcium carbonated Chromatography, obtaining a and b chlorophyll and xanthophylls. Chlorophylls absorb visible light to make the photosynthesis process of the plant. Xanthophylls are carotenoid and contain oxygen in its molecular structure. <br><br>The leaves extract contains saponins, which help to emulsify lipids. Also contains flavonoids that are naturally occurring phenolic compounds in plants. The antioxidative effect of flavonoids had long been recognized. They inhibited lipid peroxidation, to scavenge active oxygen to chelate iron ions, and to inactive lipoxygenase; it has many important biological functions and many medicinal properties. The bioassay demonstrated non toxic compounds for the brine shrimp.<br><br> <br><br>

OBESITY AT THE PEDIATRIC AGE " THIRD MILLENNIUM EPIDEMIC”
Sheyra Elin Rivera Santos 
Carlos Escobar López High School, Loiza, PR

<br><br> This investigation was intended to demonstrate that in the community of Loíza, P.R., there exists a high level of obese children and adolescents who ignore the health risks of this problem and to determine the most common possible causes for obesity. <br><br> A questionnaire was validated and used as the instrument <br><br>to obtain the data. The participants were chosen at random among the ages of 7 to 18 years. This instrument consisted of four social demographic questions, six eating habits, four family record questions, two questions to measure the knowledge they have about health problems related to obesity and twelve items to select the frequency with which they carry out certain activities or experience different daily living situation, <br><br> The data demonstrated that their favorite breakfasts are ham and cheese sandwiches with soda, and a slice of pizza at lunchtime. Most of the participant’s parents are not obese, but they have several members of the family, who are obese. <br><br> The participants preferred to watch TV and to eat at the same time and they also liked to play video games. In addition they add salt to already seasoned food and drink soda in excess, all of this without practicing any physical activities. <br><br> According to the data analysis, the participants know that being obese can cause them to develop certain illnesses, but they don’t know which are those possible illnesses. The most common causes for obesity seem to be the sedentary lifestyle (the lack of physical activities) and inadequate eating habits. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE GASTROCNEMIUS LEG MUSCLE IN SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WITH APPLICATION TO FACIAL PARALYSIS
Abhiram R. Bhashyam
Bethel Park High School, Bethel Park, PA, USA

<br><br> The purpose of this research was to measure the force and displacement of a muscle contraction following electrical stimulation for applications involving muscle paralysis. It was hypothesized that larger voltages and shorter pulse durations would produce greater muscle force and displacement, while smaller voltages and larger pulse durations would yield smaller muscle force and displacement.<br><br> Initially, varying voltages were applied through a specially programmed circuit into the exposed gastrocnemius muscle (with its nerve excised) of the Sprague-Dawley rat (Rattus norvegicus) to determine its response. Muscle contraction force and displacement values were measured in two separate trials. After stimulation, muscle force was recorded through a digital force gauge, while muscle displacement was captured using a camcorder and later quantified.<br><br> At the conclusion of the experiments, it was determined that muscle force and displacement could be graded, as a function of electric stimulation, and the hypothesis was verified. In addition, both the muscle force and displacement were found to nonlinearly increase with increasing voltages. The importance of these results in relationship to activating facial muscles that have been paralyzed is subsequently discussed. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

EXAMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATING DOWN SYNDROME WITH A 5-HT1A ANTAGONIST
Elizabeth Carey Banks
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, United States 

Down syndrome (DS) is a very frequent genetic disease, occurring 1 in 700 live births. It is due to the triplication of Chromosome 21. It is a leading cause of mental retardation as well as systemic abnormalities such as congenital heart disease and skeletal dysmorphology. Both a reduction in hippocampal volume and hippocampal function is impaired in DS. We have studied adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of a mouse model of DS, the Ts65Dn mouse, to test the hypothesis that this mechanism of replenishment of adult hippocampal neurons may be impaired in this model of DS. Previous data suggests that in Ts65Dn there is the overexpression of the gene product of KCJ6. This results in the overproduction of GIRK2 potassium (K+) channels coupled to a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) and therefore excess serotonin-induced inhibition. . The second aim of my project was to study the effects of applying a 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100635, to a Ts65Dn mouse. To measure neurogenesis, brain slices treated with a 5-HT1a antagonist and untreated slices from both Ts65Dn and wildtype mice (C57B/J6) were immunohistologically examined for cell proliferation with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Specifically, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, which normally displays widespread neurogenesis, was examined. Compared to untreated C57B/J6 mice, untreated Ts65Dn mice display 46% less neurogenesis. However, treating Ts65Dn mice with WAY-100635 increases neurogenesis 40% to 62% that of untreated C57b/J6 mice. Treating C57B/J6 mice with WAY-100635 does not change neurogenesis. These findings, though preliminary, may eventually lead to the clinical use of serotonin antagonists in Down syndrome patients as a treatment for mental retardation.

THE PRO-APOPTOTIC ROLE OF THE STRESS-ACTIVATED MAP KINASE ERK IN AMPA-INDUCED DARK CELL DEGENERATION IN PURKINJE NEURONS
Anna Maria Symm
Muleshoe High School, Muleshoe, Texas, U.S.A.

Our brains employ neurotoxicity because the developing mammalian brain contains more than twice the amount of neurons needed in the adult. When excessive toxicity occurs, however, chronic neurodegenerative diseases can be caused, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases in the cerebral cortex and autism and ataxias in the cerebellum, which controls motor coordination. Excitotoxicity is controlled by the glutamate subreceptors, namely the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor. AMPA-mediated toxicity induces a unique form of cell death called dark cell degeneration (DCD).<br><br> The cerebellar Purkinje cells are known to be selectively vulnerable to AMPA-induced DCD. To test our theory that dually-phosphorylated ERK (one of three MAP kinases found in AMPA signaling cascades) is pro-apoptotic, despite the dogma that it is pro-survival, we used rat cerebellar slices that had been treated with AMPA to perform a temporal study of the presence of ERK in cells expressing dark cells. We fluorescently tagged ERK that had been dually-phosphorylated, and stained slices with Toluidine blue for morphological assessments. <br><br> We found that in cells treated with AMPA, ERK was doubly-phosphorylated, showing that indeed, AMPA activated ERK. We also saw that when an ERK antagonist was added to cells prior to their exposure to AMPA, levels of DCD dropped and those of healthy cells rose, showing that there is indeed a causal relationship between the activation of ERK and AMPA-induced neurotoxicity. In proving that ERK is pro-apoptotic, we have opened the doors for further research that could lead to new treatment and diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases.<br><br>

MODULATION OF THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME COMPLEX VIA MORPHINE COUPLED NITRIC OXIDE RELEASE: A POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THE PREVENTION OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
Suraj Hitendra Rambhia
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho NY, USA

Over the past several decades, there is a growing need for the development of neuroprotective compounds, those that can prevent neural death. It was proposed that nitric oxide (NO), when induced by morphine sulfate, would produce neuroprotection in a human neuroblastoma cell line when tested concomitantly with compounds that produce intracellular oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.<br><br> Experiments were performed to test for NO involvement in intracellular protein degradation, controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome complex. It was proposed that NO would produce neuroprotection by specifically targeting and re-directing proteins for normal degradation via the 26S proteasome chymotrypsin active site, specific for nitrated and basic proteins.<br><br> Experiments involved examining neural cell viability and morphology in addition to the analysis of gene specific mRNA levels via semi-quantitative RT-PCR, protein levels via Western blotting, enzymatic activity via fluorogenic substrate-cleaving assays, and NO release via the Apollo 4000 real-time free radical amperometric detector.<br><br> Significant neuroprotection on the cellular and molecular levels serves as a foundation for future work concerning the development of novel ligands for morphine’s mu3 opiate receptor in an effort to prevent cellular death associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Uses for these ligands may have broader implications in disease prevention since the production of constitutive NO via the mu3 opiate receptor has been observed in numerous human cell and tissue types.

DELAYED APOPTOTIC CELL CLEARANCE INDUCE AUTOANTIBODY TO HNRNP P2
Kinjal S Shah
Ridgeway High, Memphis TN, Shelby

Deficiencies in clearance of apoptotic cells predispose to the development of autoimmune disease. This is evident in mice lacking the receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl, and Mer that mediate uptake of apoptotic cells. Deficient mice exhibit an increased abundance of apoptotic cells in tissues and manifest diverse autoimmune conditions. To test these mice for the presence of autoantibodies to apoptotic cells, we generated spontaneous splenic B cell hybridomas and used microscopy to screen for clones reactive with apoptotic Jurkat cells. From hybridomas secreting IgG antibodies reactive with apoptotic cells, we selected one that recreated the major serum specificity for apoptotic cells. The antibody, LHC7.15, bound to an antigen that is differentially distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in live and apoptotic cells. In late apoptotic cells, the antigen coalesces into aggregates that form blebs at the cell surface. Immunopurification of the antigen, followed by mass spectrometry, identified a protein of 69kD whose partial sequence matched hnRNP P2. This multi-functional protein binds DNA, RNA, and several known RNP autoantigens. <br><br>Our observations suggest that an RNP complex, formed and translocated to the cell surface in apoptosis, participates in the induction of linked sets of anti-RNP autoantibodies. Our results also implicate hnRNP P2 as a potential novel antigen involved in initiating and sustaining systemic autoimmune diseases. <br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION INTO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: ANTIBODIES TO CD44 AND INTEGRIN ALPHA4BETA1 DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT MYELIN-SPECIFIC T-CELL RESPONSES
June-Ho Kim
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA, USA

Adhesion molecules CD44 and integrin ALPHA4BETA1 have been implicated in recruitment and extravasation of myelin-reactive T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) of the human autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Previously shown, antibodies to CD44 and ALPHA4BETA1 prevent CNS inflammation and ameliorate symptoms of EAE. However, the effect of these antibodies on the function of myelin-reactive T cells is still unknown. --- In this study, we assessed proliferation and cytokine secretion of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T-cells following anti-CD44 and anti-ALPHA4BETA1 treatment. We hypothesized that anti-ALPHA4BETA1 would inhibit proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, we hypothesized that the stimulatory anti-CD44 antibody would promote proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. --- T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of MBP Ac 1-11 TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with MBP peptide and antibodies. We performed Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays to measure cytokine secretion, and antigen-specific T cell proliferation assay. First, we observed that the antibodies did not inhibit T cell proliferation. Second, there was an increase in secretion of immuno- suppressive cytokine interleukin-10 by both antibodies. Furthermore, we found up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-GAMMA, tumor necrosis factor-ALPHA, and interleukin-12 in cells treated with anti-CD44, whereas these cytokines were down-regulated by anti-ALPHA4BETA1. These results suggest that, though anti-ALPHA4BETA1 and anti-CD44 both prevent EAE, they differentially affect pro-inflammatory cytokine production by T cells. Most importantly, the immuno- suppressive role of anti-ALPHA4BETA1 makes it a promising therapy for EAE and MS.

MODIFIED TOBACCO PRODUCTS REVEAL THE CRITICAL ROLE OF NICOTINE IN PROMOTING ATHEROGENESIS
Sarah Emily Catanzaro
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington, NY, United States

The tobacco industry is currently marketing modified tobacco products as potentially less harmful alternatives to conventional cigarettes. However, there are few if any biological readout systems to assess the effects of such products. The effects of mainstream smoke from three different modified tobacco cigarettes, Quest1, Quest3, and Eclipse, to a standard research cigarette and a non-smoking control on the development of atherosclerosis in the apolipoproteinE-deficient mouse were investigated. Quest cigarettes have varying nicotine levels, but the same tar content, while Eclipse heats rather than burns the tobacco.<br><br>Laboratory personnel exposed mice to mainstream smoke from each of these products as well as a reference cigarette (2R4F), 1 hour per day, 5 days per week, for 12 weeks. They also explosed an additional group of mice to Eclipse smoke for 1.5 hours per day to achieve a similar total smoke product (TSP). Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were measured by laboratory personel and slides of the aorta were prepared by laboratory personnel as well. I designed the study and determined hematocrit and cholesterol levels and atherosclerotic lesion area in the aorta at the end of the study.<br><br>Only the mice exposed to high nicotine levels from Quest1 and 2R4F cigarettes had increased aortic atherosclerosis. All mice increased in weight over the course of the study, although the weight gain in control mice was slightly higher. Blood pressure was the same in all groups; however heart rate was significantly lower at the end of 12 weeks in mice smoking 2R4F.<br><br>These findings suggest that nicotine is the primary determinant of atherogenesis in this model. In addition, this study shows that effects of mainstream smoke can be evaluated in a biological model that can be used to compare the effects of different types of cigarettes.

LOW DOSE MORPHINE PRIMING PREVENTS HIGH DOSE MORPHINE INDUCED MACROPHAGE INJURY
Ekta Patel
Syosset High School, Syosset NY, USA

Morphine is a narcotic analgesic (a class of drugs that relieve pain without causing loss of consciousness), which has the primary job of controlling and limiting severe pain and is widely used in today's society. Macrophages, particularly MMQ's, are types of white blood cells that reside in tissues, out of the bloodstream, where they attack foreign substances and help the rest of the immune system identity harmful toxins, bacteria, and viruses and are also known as the "policemen" of the body. The apoptosis, programmed cell death, of macrophages after high and low dosage of morphine was added and tested. The higher doses of morphine increased the apoptosis levels as the lower doses of morphine decreased the apoptosis levels, reducing them further than the control. Thus, testing low dose morphine priming, it was concluded that priming with a low dose of morphine could prevent high dose cell injury and be beneficial for the human body. Moreover, the withdrawal effects of morphine show that it is favorable to expose the macrophages for the minimum amount of time to the morphine to attain the least percentage of apoptosis.

EFFECTS OF GUANOSINE ON ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN IN A PARKINSON'S DISEASE MODEL
Patrick John Martin
Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary School, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Studies have shown that a build-up of alpha-synuclein occurs in Lewy Bodies, deposits commonly found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of Parkinson’s disease patients. Alpha-synuclein induces neuronal apoptosis when over expressed.<br><br> This experiment attempted to determine if the neurotoxin MPP+ induced apoptosis and alpha-synuclein expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and investigated whether the addition of guanosine, a purine nucleoside, prevented MPP+-induced alpha-synuclein expression.<br><br> It was hypothesized that neuroblastoma cells treated with MPP+ would show an increase in levels of alpha-synuclein expression and that cells treated with guanosine would have a lower alpha-synuclein expression.<br><br> An ELISA alpha-synuclein test and a BCA assay were performed using protein extracts from cells already treated with MPP+ and/or guanosine. Based on these results, the amount of alpha-synuclein relative to the amount of total protein was calculated.<br><br> Statistical analysis using ANOVA showed no significance as the power of the performed test was below the desired power of 0.800. Assays performed showed that alpha-synuclein expression was highest in vehicular control samples (9.91439E-06 relative to amount of total protein) instead of in MPP+ samples. This was determined to have occurred because 500 micromoles was the exposure level used. This was thought to be more realistic for a disease model; however, previous studies used millimolar concentrations of MPP+.<br><br> Although results were not statistically significant, a lack of alpha-synuclein expression in samples treated with guanosine was observed. This experiment demonstrates the potential of guanosine as a therapeutic treatment for Parkinson’s disease.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF ZINC ON THE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN COCKROACHES
Lauren Mino Chuday
Oakton High School, Vienna, Virginia, USA

This experiment attempted to investigate the effect of Zinc on cholesterol levels of cockroaches. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches were selected because they possess fat bodies, which could be extracted and examined. Distilled water was mixed in a 1-liter container with 2.9 grams of Zn into a suspension. The suspension was divided in half and .5 liters of distilled water was added to attain the 1.45 g/mL suspension of Zn. The 2.9 and 1.45 g/mL suspensions were fed to 3 cockroaches each and distilled water was fed to 3 control cockroaches. I am 95% confident, according to the 2 Sample T-Test, that the weight gain the cockroaches exhibited was due to the Zinc, as it was the only substance provided in differing amounts, 2.9 and 1.45 g/mL, to the cockroaches. The Molybdenum Blue Reagent Spray and Sudan IV were used to display the migration of fats that the cockroaches contained up the silicon gel plates which were used in gel chromatography. The analyses of the qualitative molecular weights were used to determine the difference between the LDL and HDL cholesterol. Though the 2.9 g/mL cockroaches did gain the most weight throughout the experiment, they displayed the lowest amounts of cholesterol.

COMPREHENSIVE EVOLUTIONARY STUDY OF DISEASE-CAUSING AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTIONS USING COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS
Jeffrey M. Bhasin
Rocky River High School, Rocky River, Ohio USA

Large scale sequencing has resulted in public databases receiving a monumental amount of new data. Comparative evolutionary studies of species at the genetic level can now be done. Disease-causing sequences in humans have been incidentally reported to exist as wild type (normal) sequences in other organisms. No published study has compared to what extent this occurs. This study compared known human disease-causing amino acid substitutions to wild type sequences across all available vertebrate organisms. No published software existed to perform this task; custom programming was developed to accomplish high-throughput computational analysis techniques. Of 1,081 genes identified, 257 (24%) were found to have one or more occurrence of a human disease-causing sequence present as wild type (normal) sequence in other organisms. The gene that had the most mutations (codon locations) was the gene causing Retinitis Pigmentosa, with 243 codons, followed by Von Willebrand Disease (140 codons) and Cystic Fibrosis (74 codons). This study discovered functionally relevant codon locations, as they indicate where a change has occurred between species, underscoring a biologic difference. Major questions have yet to be answered about how a particular allele goes from being neutral or beneficial in one organism to disease-causing in another. This study documented the prevalence of human Mendelian disease sequences present as normal sequences in other vertebrates. This information can lead to finding suitable new animal models of human disease. These findings additionally permit further study of these now identified substitutions, a necessary step in the development of effective disease treatment.

GOT DIELECTRICS? SIMULATING ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF MUSCLE
Stephanie Baker
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, Utah, USA

This project is the result of experimentation to create an easily reproducible cost-effective solid that simulates electrical properties of human muscle tissue for testing medical implant devices. <br><br> This was done using a dielectric probe to analyze effects of various quantities of sugar and salt dissolved in distilled water on the relative permittivity and conductivity of such solutions. Graphing results of the probe readings determined that a solution of eight ounces distilled water with 6-8 tablespoons sugar and 3/8 to 5/8 teaspoons salt yielded probe measurements at 400 Mhz within ten percent of the accepted values of relative permittivity and conductivity of human muscle tissue, namely 64.72 and 43.22, respectively. <br><br> Given this range of sugar and salt quantities, solid mixtures were created by adding two tablespoons of TX151 gelling agent to various solutions whose probe values were recorded and analyzed. It was then possible to predict exact quantities of sugar, salt, TX151 and distilled water that would produce a solid with probe readings within five percent of those found in human muscle tissue. A solid was made with predicted quantities which yielded permittivity and conductivity measurements of 64.98 and 44.37, respectively. <br><br> Contributions of this project will provide for cost-effective testing of the behavior of electrical signals in muscle tissue which in turn will lead to medical implant devices that can artificially stimulate muscle tissue. It will also lead to the development of new imaging techniques that can detect muscle tissue irregularities.

PRESERVATIVE EFFICACY OF GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) ON MEAT AND EGGS TO PREVENT FOOD BORNE ILLNESSES CAUSED BY SALMONELLA AND E. COLI
Nandini Sarma
Shawnee Mission East High School, Prairie Village KS, USA

Poultry, meat, and egg industries use chemical preservatives that may be harmful to human health in the long run. This study was designed to evaluate if garlic can be used as a natural preservative to prevent meat and egg spoilage due to bacterial growth during storage. Garlic extracts were prepared using fresh garlic bulbs. Skinless chicken legs, commercially available eggs, and non-pathogenic strains of Salmonella and E. coli were used as test models. For testing the preservative efficacy of garlic extract on meat, chicken legs and eggs were experimentally contaminated with Salmonella and E. coli, and then treated with garlic extract. They were compared to the appropriate non treated controls, and were tested for different periods of storage (15 days for meat, 4 weeks for eggs). The meat was stored under refrigeration, and eggs were stored at room temperature and refrigeration temperature.<br><br>Garlic was found to be a very effective preservative that prevented bacteria induced meat and egg spoilage. It preserved chicken meat for up to 15 days, and eggs for up to 4 weeks, in both temperatures. If this technology is used appropriately by food industries, it could reduce cases of bacteria induced food borne illnesses in meat and egg consumers and will be an effective replacement for chemical preservatives. Also, it would be a very realistic option for developing countries for effective sanitization and storage. The findings of this research would be helpful in making safe and healthy food products, eventually leading to the maintenance of better health.<br><br>

AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE INCIDENCE RATE OF BORRELIA BURGDORFERI IN IXODES SCAPULARIS FROM CLEARWATER COUNTY
Rachel Ann Drewlow
Bagley Jr./Sr. High School, Bagley, MN, USA

Lyme disease is an illness caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Spread to humans via infected ticks of the Ixodes genus, it has quickly become a national health concern. The black legged tick, Ixodes scapularis is responsible for the occurrence of this disease within the northern and north-central United States. While extensive research has been conducted to discover and monitor the rates of I. Scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi within these areas, no such actions have been taken in Clearwater County, Minnesota.<br><br>This research was performed in a three step process: lysing of tick cells, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and gel electrophoresis. All procedures were conducted according to the manufacture’s protocol and/or common practices. <br><br> <br><br>Ticks were collected from the hides of five legally harvested deer from Clearwater County. Of the twenty adult ticks obtained, fifteen were ultimately tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi bacteria. DNA from each I. scapularis, a negative control, and two positive controls of known B. burgdorferi were prepared using nested PCR. This technique was performed twice to ensure correct laboratory procedure. Results discovered the effectiveness of the protocol, but failed to provide clear information as to the incidence rate of B. burgdorferi in the I. scapularis. 15/16 I. scapularis showed positive results for the presence of B. burgdorferi. However, due to the intense specificity of the process, contamination is of high concern and quite possible. <br><br>

IN VITRO INNATE IMMUNITY: EFFICIENT TESTING OF THE GENETIC RESPONSE OF PARENCHYMAL HEPATOCYTES TO LPS TREATMENTS AND THE REDUCTION OF INFLAMMATION BY ANTIOXIDANTS
Melanie Elizabeth Huffman
Heritage Christian School, Indianapolis, Indiana USA

Most immunology studies are conducted in vivo or with cultures that include macrophages. The use of parenchymal hepatocytes to study the innate immune response provides an efficient method of research requiring fewer animals to be used and/or reduced time. <br><br> The project purpose was to study the innate immune response using parenchymal hepatocytes and to determine if alpha-tocopherol plays a role. The innate immune response of parenchymal rat and canine hepatocytes was initiated with a 1 and .1 ug/ml dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 50% of cells were pretreated 24 hours with alpha-tocopherol and then treated with tocopherol and LPS for 4 and 24 hours. The remaining 50% were treated with LPS for 4 and 24 hours. Genechip microarrays showed upregulations in immune response genes associated with inflammation indicating LPS initiated an immune response. Cells treated with LPS were characterized by an upregulation of chemokines, cytokines, and cytochromes. The 4-hour (acute) response was stronger than the 24 hour. LPS treated cells showed an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative stress suggesting ROS (reactive oxygen species) production.<br><br> Results closely paralleled in vivo studies. In general, tocopherol lowered LDH leakage (damage) and decreased immunogenic proteins suggesting effectiveness in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS damage associated with inflammation (scarring). <br><br> Inflammation has been linked to diseases such as fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s. ROS production is associated with the immune response and prolongs inflammation. Implications are In vitro studies using parenchymal hepatocytes could provide a controlled and efficient way to support inflammation research by rapidly screening the effects of an unknown endotoxin with reduced time and/or animals.<br><br>

CHANGES IN BRAIN FUNCTION FOLLOWING HIGH/LOW NOVELTY-SEEKING
Saate Saiyara Shakil
Benson Polytechnic High School, Portland, Oregon, USA

The focus of this study was to determine whether there is a correlation between locomotor response to a novel environment and levels of extracellular glutamate in the dorso-lateral striatum of mice. Past studies have shown that there is difference in cocaine self-administration between groups of rats with different responses to novel environments, which could be tied to levels of neurotransmitters in certain regions of the brain. A group of mice were behaviorally tested and separated into two groups (High and Low Responders) according to their locomotor response to a novel environment. Samples of extracellular fluid were then taken from the dorso-lateral striatum of these mice, using the technique of in vivo microdialysis. The samples were then analyzed for glutamate using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The dorso-lateral striatum from these same mice were taken for gold-particle glutamate immunolabeling to be analyzed using electron microscopy. This study found that high responders had significantly lower extracellular levels of glutamate in the dorso-lateral striatum than did low responders. However, there was no significant difference in density of glutamate immunolabeling within nerve terminals between the two groups. These findings beg further questions, such as whether high and low responders will respond differently to pharmaceutical drugs or drugs of abuse.

AN ANALYSIS OF BRAIN TISSUE SECTIONS FOR PROTEINS TARGETED BY THE GENOTOXICANT METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL (MAM)
Allison Shelton Rhines
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Western Pacific ALS/PDC is a neurodegenerative disorder that is reportedly caused by exposure to the neurotoxin cycasin and/or its aglycone, methylazoxymethanol (MAM). After MAM crosses the blood-brain barrier, it has been recently shown to influence the expression of genes in the Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway, rendering it near ineffective and causing a potential buildup of protein aggregates within the brain. When synapses are blocked by protein aggregates, neurons are unable to communicate and this may result in the expression of symptoms of common neurodegenerative disorders. I conducted a series of experiments with the goal of determining the exact brain region location of the disturbances in protein levels and also of determining whether or not these disturbances were induced by a mechanism of DNA damage. My goal was to find the best concentration of antibody to get an effective reaction with different tissue proteins. Once the concentration of the three antibodies had been established, I applied them in immunohistochemistry to determine the regions of the brain in which these proteins were affected by MAM. Finally, to test the hypothesis that MAM influences the degradation of proteins through a mechanism involving DNA damage, I examined these proteins in brain tissue sections from wild type (C57) mice and compared them to DNA repair deficient (MGMT-/-) mice. The DNA repair mutant mice showed significant differences in protein levels when compared to C57 mice, leading to the conclusion that MAM does in fact influence important brain tissue proteins through a DNA damage mechanism.

SALIVA: THE STRESS CODE
Ketaki Rawal
Centennial Regional High School, 880 Hudson, Greenfield Park,Que J4V 1H1, Canada

HPA Reactivity to stress in 14-15 year olds.<br><br>Stress has been implicated in a variety of disorders of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and immunological systems as well as in memory impairment.<br><br>The body’s stress response systems are the HPA axis and the ANS system and lead to an increase in cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure when stressed. Cortisol can be measured effectively in saliva- a non-invasive procedure. <br><br>In this experiment, physiological responses of adolescents to a commonly occurring stressor in school, were measured. Heart rate, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol were measured both at basal levels, and under stressful conditions, and differences in response and gender differences were recorded. Results showed two distinct groups, based on salivary cortisol measurements- Responders and Non Responders. The results suggest that Non Responders may have altered HPA reactivity to stress, and may have an increased vulnerability to future disease. In this research, the HPA responsiveness to stress is proposed as a screening tool for identification of populations that are at an increased risk for stress-induced disorders. <br><br><br> <br><br>

In an expanded project, one hoped to determine the effects of different concentrations of heated and non-heated aspartame on Eucidaris tribuloides. When tested, one expects heated solution A to have the least amount of zygotes produced.<br><br> Solutions A, B and C were made by the process of serial dilution. 237 ml of each solution was heated to 71.1C and allowed to cool. 39.5 ml of the specified solution was then added to each plate. By the process of chemical release, the gametes were released into the shedding cups. One squirt of eggs and sperm was added to each plate and results were taken after 80 minutes and 36 hours.<br><br> At the end of the 80 minutes, group A had a total average of 14.1 zygotes. In group B, there was a total average of 3.7 zygotes. Similarly, there was an average of 3.2 in group C and 8.6 in group D. In group E, an average of 2.7 zygotes had developed, followed by 3.1 in group F and 3.6 in group G. After 36 hours group A had a total average of 5.2. In group B, a total average of 4.2 was recorded. Group C had a total of 4.5 and group D showed an average of 4.3. In group E, there was an average of 2.9. Group F showed an average of 3.8 zygotes followed by group G with 4.2.<br><br> These results supported the hypothesis that aspartame has an adverse affect on life and when used in large heated quantities, the effect is multiplied.<br><br>

EFFECT OF VITAMIN E ON ULTRAVIOLET INDUCED MUTAGENESIS
Kawakahi Kaeo Amina
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI USA

This project seeks to evaluate the role of Vitamin E (alph-and gamma-tocopherol), on the repair of eukaryotic DNA induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. Previous research showed bacterial cells incubated in antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene) and irradiated with various amounts of UV increased in overall survivability—where alpha-tocopherol increased cell survivability two and a half times over the control but was unable to reduce damage at irradiation levels over 10mJ. Current research extends the use of Vitamin E into a eukaryotic model involving the human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. DNA damage induced by UV in K562 cells was evaluated using the Comet assay and it repair measured by viability and growth after irradiation.. The Comet assay showed that after 24 hours of incubation with alpha-tocopherol, there was measurable decrease in DNA damage after UV irradiation compared to vehicle (tetrahydrofuran) control. gamma-Tocopherol was less effective a decreasing the amount of DNA damage. The growth of K562 cells was assessed following tocopherol pretreatment and UV irradiation (between 5 and 20mJ) of UV. Alpha-Tocopherol pretreated cells showed an almost two fold increase in cell numbers over those cells that were not treated, consistent with the DNA repair results. Whether tocopherols protect DNA from UV damage or enhance DNA repair is currently under investigation. However data strongly support a role for tocopherols in protecting against UV-induced DNA damage.

THE EFFECT OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE SKULL ON INTELLIGIBILITY OF SPEECH FROM PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS
Erin Marie Fischell
High Technology High School, Lincroft NJ, United States of America

This experiment was conducted to determine the plausibility of transmitting intelligible speech through the skull by means of vibration from a piezoelectric transducer. It was hypothesized that the intelligibility of speech transmitted through a skull from a piezoelectric transducer would increase with the use of a frequency filter. A three-part experiment was conducted to determine the validity of this hypothesis. The first part determined the frequency response of the piezoelectric transducer and skull bone combination based on six target frequencies. The second part was transmitting speech in the form of well-established phonetically balanced sentences through the skull. In the third part, the frequency equalizer was used to create a custom filter based on the results from the frequency testing. While the unfiltered speech displayed basic intelligibility based on an ALCON percentage test, during the third part of the experiment the intelligibility increased significantly, and the research hypothesis was accepted and the null rejected. These results strongly indicate that it is possible to transmit intelligible speech through the skull from a piezoelectric transducer.

EXPANDING THE REPERTOIRE OF THE YIR GENES DETECTABLE IN A PLASMODIUM YOELII INFECTION: A MODEL FOR STUDYING ANTIGENIC VARIATION IN MALARIA
Kunal Jose Bhayani
The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Elstree, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom

Malaria kills around 1.5 million people each year and it affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. It is caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium which is transmitted from person to person by the female Anopheles mosquito. <br><br>Following infection, the parasite avoids the immune response by varying the antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. <br><br>On this basis, research was conducted using the rodent variant Plasmodium yoelii. This model can be used for studying antigenic variation in the parasite. It is suspected that the yir gene family present in P. yoelii, which is similar to the gene families, var and vir, present in the human malarial parasites P. vivax and P.falciparum respectively, is involved in this antigenic variation. <br><br>The project involved detecting transcription within the yir gene family in a mixed infection of P. yoelii. The method involved techniques such as: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to replicate the genetic material, and TA Cloning to ligate the genetic material into Escherichia coli. Bacterial colonies were cultured and sub-cultured and the transcribed genetic material sequenced. <br><br>The data showed that yir genes were transcribed from across the gene family which had not been documented before. This shows that various yir genes are actively transcribed by the parasite in a mixed infection which further enhances the hypothesis that they may be responsible for antigenic variation. This in turn raises the possibility of producing drugs to inactivate the genes involved in antigenic variation and allow the host’s immune system to destroy the malarial parasites. <br><br>

THE MATRIX PROBE - EVOLUTION , CO-REGISTRATION OF DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WITH 3DIMENSIONAL BREAST ULTRASOUND USING A FULL-FIELD MATRIX OF PIEZOELECTRIC CRYSTAL TRANSDUCERS
Chetley L. C. Gervais
Sandwich Secondary School, LaSalle Ontario, Canada

A novel multi-modality “fusion” breast imaging system producing <br><br>CO-REGISTERED full-field digital mammography and 3D breast ultrasound data sets is displayed. Specifically a large format fixed array of piezoelectric crystals incorporated into a modified digital mammography compression paddle is proposed which can be rotated out of the way during the mammography exposure without altering the position or compression of the breast. A sonolucent plastic insert allows simultaneous production, co-registration of mammography and breast ultrasound data. Feasibility of the design is confirmed by manual production of co-registered sequential high resolution DICOM3 images of the entire breast phantom. This USA patent pending medical device has significant patient care advantages including approximately 100 times more breast ultrasound imaging information provided to the Radiologist for diagnostic review than during conventional breast ultrasound imaging, sequential slice review and 3D reconstruction by existing DICOM3 medical software. “Fusion” ultrasound images can also be subjected to multi-planar re-slicing to demonstrate the relationship of objects within the tissue data block and to existing normal breast structures. This project is the first successful creation of a practical “fusion” breast imaging system. Electronic switching of the proposed large field piezoelectric crystal array and auto-segmentation algorithms will provide “real time"( 4D) full-field ultrasound with enhanced vascular imaging increasing the potential medical usage of this device. Co-registration image "fusion" is achieved by simultaneous imaging in compression therefore for the first time exact 3D spatial correlation between digital mammography and breast ultrasound is possible. Improved SENSITIVITY and SPECIFICITY during screening will result in earlier and more accurate diagnosis of breast cancer.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ACID REDUCERS ON THE BACTERIAL INHIBITORY ABILITY OF STOMACH ACID
Adam Lee Hubrig
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND, USA

Purpose: The purpose was to determine the effects of acid reducers on the ability of stomach acid to inhibit the growth of bacteria. In addition, to compare three types of acid reducers: cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine.<br><br>Procedures: <br><br>Dilution formation: Collected sixteen acid reducers and created four dilutions by dissolving 250, 500, 750, and 1000 milligrams of acid reducer into 50 milliliters of a 1.6 pH (0.025 molarity) hydrochloric acid solution. Next, the change in pH was determined through the utilization of the pH Testr2 (retaining the solutions upon completion).<br><br>pH: Created (and determined the pH of) a solution composed of an acid reducer and distilled water to use as a control for the purpose of the Kirby Bauer procedure. Next, 100 milligrams of acid reducer was dissolved into 50 milliliters of distilled water. The pH was recorded and the solutions were retained.<br><br>Kirby Bauer: Conducted to measure the inhibition zones (of five separate, pure cultures of bacteria) produced by six solutions: the HCl solution, the acid reducer-distilled water solution, and the four acid reducer-HCl dilutions for each acid reducer. <br><br>Conclusion: Upon plotting data from the dilution formation tests on a line graph, I established that each of the chemicals satisfied unique equations. Cimetidine had the greatest impact on the solution’s pH. In the Kirby Bauer procedure, I determined that the higher the dilution of acid reducer, the larger the inhibition zone proved to be. Overall, I conclude that acid reducers have a higher potential to destroy bacteria than stomach acid.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF IPRIFLAVONE ON HUMAN OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION AND CELL MORPHOLOGY IN VITRO
Lindsay Rachel MacLeod
Suffern High School, Suffern, New York, USA

Ipriflavone (7-isopropoxyisoflavone), a synthetic isoflavone derivative, remains controversial as to its potential usefulness in treating patients with osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption and increasing osteoblastic bone formation. This study examines the effects of ipriflavone on morphology and resorption of human osteoclast cells grown in culture. Similar studies have been performed with alendronate, an anti-resorptive agent commonly prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis. A significant inhibition of bone resorption has been observed with this bisphosphonate at 10-4 M. The present goal is to determine the effectiveness of ipriflavone on osteoclast resorption, and its significance as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.<br><br> CD14+ monocytes were grown on bovine bone slices in cell culture dishes for 21 days. Ipriflavone was added at 10-4M, 10-5M and 10-6M concentrations from day 15 through day 19. The cell culture media was assayed for c-telopeptide (CTX) (a bone resorption marker) at days 19 and 22. Cells were also grown in 10-4M alendronate and assayed for CTX. This served as a positive indicator of inhibition of bone resorption. Digital images, taken at several intervals, assessed cell morphology. <br><br>

EVALUATION OF MMP AND TIMP EXPRESSION IN HUMAN PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS
Jeff Silpe
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, New York, United States of America

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases’ (TIMP) levels and their inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases’ (MMP) activity were examined in human pediatric de novo brain tumors. Prior proposed theories suggest that elevated TIMP levels are an acute host response to extracellular matrix degradation and that those TIMP levels are direct down-regulator of MMP activity. Fourteen human patients’ tissues were stained for expression of TIMP-1, 2, 4 and MMP-2, 8 to reveal a correlation between their levels and activity. Also, tumor cells were transfected with rhTIMP-4 and analyzed for expression with immunofluorescence cell staining after 48 and 72 hours. A trend of strong TIMP-4 expression became evident in the medulloblastoma patients’ tissues. The strongest expression was found in the astrocytoma patient. The rhTIMP-4, in the transfected cells, continued to be expressed after 48 hours and 72 hours. This means that rhTIMP-4 has the potential for therapeutic applications because it correlates with the down-regulation of MMP activity—halting the malignant process—and is continuously expressed in tumor cells up to 72 hours. These results support the theory of a direct down-regulation of MMP activity by TIMP.

NOVEL GENETIC ANALYSIS OF DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND HEREDITARY PATTERNS USING A MULTI-POPULATION DATA SET
Nicholas Paul Semenkovich
Ladue Horton Watkins High School, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA

Individual variations in the genetic code hold the promise of explaining differences in physical characteristics, disease susceptibility, aging, and sensitivities to medications. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common DNA sequence variants that appear in similar patterns among people of the same ethnicity and race. SNPs are thought to be associated with diverse diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease, but the utility of SNPs is compromised by their frequency. They are common and may represent true differences in protein structure, linkage disequilibrium with other genetic loci, or innocuous differences. To test the hypothesis that robust computer algorithms can predict the potential usefulness of SNPs and sequence data, I developed computer algorithms to determine the usability of a multi-population database of sequences. In the first stage of this project, I used a novel protocol to determine: the potential usefulness of SNPs, areas of overlap between SNPs and disease markers, and nonsynonymous SNPs between populations (those causing amino acid changes). I used these data to define linkage disequilibrium across the data set. In the second stage, I expanded this protocol to analyze the impact of entire sequence regions on disease susceptibility and to define heredity. These studies provide proof of concept that bioinformatics can help bridge the gap between descriptive data from the human genome and clinically relevant issues such as hereditary patterns and the genetic propensity to develop disease.

IN VITRO INDUCTION OF MYOBLASTS: STIMULATION OF MYOGENIC PHENOMENA IN MARROW STEM CELLS
Gulraiz Zahid Khan
North Attleborough High, North Attleborough MA, USA

Bone marrow has long been known to be a source of stem cells capable of regeneration of the hematopoietic system. Traditional concepts indicate that stem cells give rise to progenitor cells in a hierarchical system. Recently, however, research had raised the possibility that stem cells from bone marrow are able to differentiate into many other tissues and organs including lung, muscle, liver, and heart, garnering widespread attention. The experiments conducted focused on investigating the inducer(s) responsible for the conversion of marrow stem cells into muscle fibers.<br><br> The inducers (Myogenic Regulatory Factors) used in this study were MyoD, Myf5, PAX3, C-MET, MNF, and B-actin. Based on an analysis of RNA (by means of a RT-PCR), it was determined that only MyoD gained entrance to the marrow cells. Its presence suggests an effective method of converting marrow stem cells into muscle.<br><br> Although the mechanisms for the entrance of MyoD are unknown, one hypothesis is that injured muscle cells send out soluble signals (e.g. cytokines), resulting in a change of permeability of marrow cell membranes thus allowing MyoD to enter and converting the stem cells to muscle. The results also support the theory that in order for conversion to occur, the muscle has to be injured.<br><br>

AYURVEDIC MEDICINE AGAINST HUMAN BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCER CELL LINES
Rhea Chattopadhyay
La Cueva High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America

Turmeric is common in Indian cooking. Curcumin, a potent constituent of Turmeric is used throughout Ayurvedic Medicine. Curcumin is known to have anti-oxidant and anti-tumor properties. The purpose of this project was to determine the potentially inhibiting effects of Curcumin and Turmeric against cancerous epithelial cell proliferation under different conditions; the presence or absence of IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) and fetal bovine serum (a source of growth factors).<br><br> The cell lines used in this study were the human breast cancer line, MCF-7 and the androgen dependent human prostate cancer cell line, LNCAP-FGC. Procedures included direct application of both Curcumin and Turmeric to each individual cell line cultured in-vitro in media containing or lacking IGF-1 and fetal bovine serum. The presence and absence of serum in this study represents the clinically observed heterogeneity of tumor tissues, which contain areas of high and low growth factor supplies. Cell proliferation was measured using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1. <br><br> Curcumin and Turmeric were found to have a potent effect against cell proliferation of the MCF-7 and the LNCAP-FGC cell lines. Even in the presence of the growth factor IGF-1 both Curcumin and Turmeric negatively affected cell proliferation, possibly by inducing cell apoptosis and/or necrosis. The presence of serum strongly counter-acted the anti-proliferative effect of Curcumin and Turmeric, indicating the importance of multiple growth factors for the survival of cancer cells.<br><br>The results signify both Curcumin and Turmeric’s use as an effective agent against breast and prostate cancer in future experiments and clinical studies.

MODELING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES PHASE II: FLU VACCINATION STRATEGIES IN A STRUCTURED VILLAGE
Laura Mcbride Glass
Albuquerque High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States

In my project, I asked whether social structure influences the spread of the flu and, more importantly, whether I could find a vaccination strategy that would be most effective at saving lives during outbreaks of severe flu pandemics. Using a networked agent based model, I considered a small village of 10,000 divided into four age classes: kids, teens, adults, and seniors, each with class specific parameters such as disease contagiousness and mortality. Based on my experience, agents were placed in multiple groups such as families, school classes, businesses, and senior groups. Within each group, social links were created, with given frequencies of contact, along which the disease could spread. Simulations that increased the realism of the disease parameters and village social structure (groups and sub-group networks) demonstrated the critical importance of kids and teens in the spreading of the flu. Based on these results, I then considered several vaccination strategies including: no vaccination, current policy (26% for kids and teens, 30% for adults, 59% for seniors), seniors only vaccinated, and kids and teens only vaccinated. I found that, when using the current policy, the peak number infected decreased to almost half. While vaccinating only seniors had almost no effect on the spread of the disease, when vaccinating just kids and teens, the disease never sparked! Further simulations showed that vaccination of kids and teens at a rate of only 60% would be sufficient to eradicate most flu. These results are significant in light of vaccine shortages as we had in Fall, 2004.

PROTEIN MARKERS AS INDICATORS OF PATIENT RESPONSE TO LUNG CANCER THERAPY
Janice Lynn Gee
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, CA, United States of America

Cancer is uncontrolled cell proliferation, which results in a tumor. Tumor hypoxia is a region in a cancerous tumor that receives less oxygen then other areas of the tumor. Studies show regions of tumor hypoxia result in aggressive growth and stiff resistance against common cancer treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Monitoring this phenomenon is therefore important to patient health.<br><br> This study focused on monitoring the levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Osteopontin (OPN), and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in the plasma of small cell lung cancer patients with hypoxic tumors treated with the proteasome inhibitor drug PS-341. The hypothesis was that these specific proteins would be accurate markers in corresponding with tumor activity and patient outcome.<br><br> To test this hypothesis, blood samples from patients were taken at different times with at least one sample taken pre-treatment. The plasma from each patient was run on Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) to determine VEGF, OPN, and PAI-1 levels. Results of all blood from the same patient were compared to one another to determine correlation between protein level and tumor growth. These results were then compared with patient outcome reports to determine relation between protein activity and patient treatment effects.<br><br> Using available data, I concluded that VEGF is a better marker in monitoring patient outcome from PS-341 because it is more responsive. However, more plasma samples and patient outcome reports are needed to draw a more certain conclusion. <br><br>

ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES: A SIMULATION OF NATURAL FINGER MOVEMENT USING SILVER PALLADIUM ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS
Sushma Chennubhotla
dupont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, U.S.A 

For this project, a model was constructed using electroactive polymers to simulate natural finger movement and thereby allude to its use in artificial muscles. An electroactive polymer was synthesized, tested and then used to construct a finger of a wax hand allowing for simulation of natural finger movement. The hypothesis was that controlled finger movement will be achieved and it will effectively demonstrate electroactive polymer usage as it pertains to artificial muscles.<br><br>An electroactive polymer is a chemical compound that reacts to electrical force by movement. The specific objective of this project is to show the potential of electroactive polymers to function as artificial muscles which can take the place of metal parts in current prosthetics. The advantage of artificial muscles made of electroactive polymers is that they allow for a smooth as well as graded movement whereas prosthetic limbs are limited in their function and scope and produce smaller rigid movements due to tiny metal pieces.<br><br>The project consisted of membrane synthesis, experimental testing with a voltage frequency generator and construction of a wax hand model. Materials for the membrane were obtained by the ERI Development Company. The experimental testing was done using a 2-5 volt generator connected to a 9-volt battery. Lastly, the model by using wax to create a realistic hand model and wire to fashion the membranes into finger joints. The main result was a creation of an electroactive polymer model capable of simulating natural finger movement and demonstrating the polymers' usage in the field of prosthesis.

SILENCING OF STAHPYLOCOCCUS VIRULENCE GENES USING SIRNAS
Shaleen Tarun Cholera
White Station High School, Memphis TN, USA

The effect of IL-1b on S.aureus was investigated in terms of extra-cellular replication, adherence to IL-1b treated human lung epithelial cells (A549), replication pattern within IL-1b treated human lung epithelial cells; and mRNA expression of bicomponent leukotoxins (Luk ED, Luk PV, HlgA, HlgCB) as well as microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs). Recombinant IL-1 enhanced the extra-cellular replication of S.aureus and data indicates that IL-1b binds specifically to S.aureus in vitro. Similar patterns of bicomponent leukotoxins mRNAs and MSCRAMMs mRNAs were observed in S aureus grown in the intracellular milieu of A549 cells stimulated with IL-1b. Human lung epithelial cells had higher levels of collagen mRNA and among other MSCRAMMs mRNAs, the mRNA expression for collagen binding protein (Cna) of S.aureus was also elevated significantly. The sustained presence of IL-1b seemed to aid the adherence, invasion and intracellular persistence of S.aureus. <br><br> After examining the expression levels of: Caf1A (receptor of IL-1), lukED (leukotoxin), and Clf, Cna, and Fnbp (MSCRAMMs) in S. aureus grown in both intra-cellular milieus as well as extra-cellular milieus; and, after examining the gene expression of S. aureus Small Colony Variants that emerged from the intracellular milieu, we examined the effects of RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) on virulence genes of S.aureus, specifically: lukED, lukPV, and GYR. RNAi is a mechanism newly discovered in organisms that use Double-Stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a template to generate short-interfering RNAs, known as “siRNAs”, which “silence” sequence-specific gene expressions, thus shutting of the targeted virulence gene.<br><br>

XYLITOL XTREME: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHEWING XYLITOL GUM IN REDUCING DENTAL CARIES IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BY DECREASING THE ORAL COLONIZATION OF STREPTOCCOCUS MUTANS.
Justin Andrew Johns, Christine Elizabeth Johns
Evangelical Christian School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

Dental caries is a disease caused by Streptococcus mutans bacteria in the mouth. There exists a disagreement amongst oral health professionals as to whether the chemical composition of xylitol-based chewing gum or the mechanical act of chewing itself effectively reduces the colonization of Strep. mutans bacteria. This study seeks to examine this dispute. <br><br> Thirty-six high school students were selected and randomly divided into three test groups. Over the 28 day test period group one did not chew gum, group two chewed sugarless gum 50 minutes each day, and group three chewed gum containing 5.5 grams of xylitol for 50 minutes each day. Saliva samples were taken from each study participant on three occasions and were incubated for 48 hours prior to measuring the concentration of Strep. mutans on a scale of 0-3 using a culture broth test strip process.<br><br> Over the test period the level of Strep. mutans in the Xylitol group decreased by 12, or 67%; in the sugarless group it decreased by 1, or 6%; and in the no gum group it decreased by 2, or 12%. Using a Kruskal-Wallace ranked order test for the average bacteria readings a value of 9.823 was found. Compared to the chi-squared value of 9.210, the null hypothesis was rejected at an alpha value of .01, or a confidence level of 99%. These findings suggest that chewing xylitol gum is ten times more effective in reducing the level of tooth decay causing Strep. mutans bacteria in the mouth than chewing sugarless gum.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF CRIME SCENE "CLEAN-UP" ATTEMPTS ON DNA EVIDENCE
Daniel Sherman McGowan, Jeffrey Detzel, Mitchell Fehlberg
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if common cleaners which might be used shortly after a crime in an attempt to "clean-up" the evidence, in this case liquid ë DNA, are effective agents to significantly alter the results of electrophoresis performed on the ë DNA, thus enabling an individual to effectually skew the forensic results to clear him or her of involvement. In this experiment multiple samples of ë DNA were prepared and incubated for extended periods with several publicly available cleaning products as well as Coca-Cola Classic due to its corrosive properties which are common knowledge. Restriction enzyme Hind III was introduced to the incubated ë DNA and used to prepare the samples for electrophoresis. The samples were loaded into agarose gels prepared by the team and the electrophoresis chambers were energized. After suitable migration of the ë DNA had occurred, the chambers were de-energized and the gels were removed for staining. The results of the incubated ë DNA samples were compared to the results of control ë DNA samples with no added chemicals and a standard ë DNA digest with Hind III.

Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PR

Science has been battling cancer for years, finding and improving different ways to treat it. A biopsy is a common procedure for the verification of suspicious tumors; however this process is burdened by its sluggishness and unreliability. By using quantum dots this process can be accelerated, while increasing its precision.<br><br> Toluene was added to the quartz cells and the cheek cells were dabbed into toluene. CdSe quantum dots, color Maple Red (604nm), were added to twenty quartz cells. A section of the tumor was incised; a sample was collected and dabbed into the quartz cell. The quartz cells were filled with CdSe quantum dots; color Maple Red (604nm). They were placed in the fluorimeter and the intensity of the fluorescence was measured.<br><br> The difference in the intensities of the fluorescence was not significant in both cells. The average fluorescence of the benign cells consisted of 64.2 while the cancerous cells had an average of 84.2. When CdSe quantum dots, color Maple Red (604nm), were added to the cells, the average fluorescence for benign cells was 161.2 and the cancerous cells was 153.8. This demonstrated a significant increase in intensity of fluorescence between both cells. Data was submitted to statistical analysis, which showed low variability in the data. <br><br> This project can be modeled to be performed on live cells by cultivating cells of both cells and adding water-based quantum dots. Maybe a better detection for cancer can be created using this new method.<br><br>

USING ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBERS TO STABILIZE DNA
Brooke Marie Gillund, Amy Ann Gottfried
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to build a device capable of electrospinning nanofibers from water soluble polymers(PEO), to attach pGLO plasmids to electrospun nanofibers and to transfer the attached plasmids to E. coli bacteria for integration and expression, to determine the transformation efficiency when removing attached pGLO plasmids from nanofibers, and to determine if time has an effect on the transformation efficiency of the pGLO plasmid when attached to the nanofibers. We assembled the apparatus mainly out of PVC pipe and added electricity needed for electrospinning to it. We then added polymer to the conductive distribution cone attached to the wire and successfully spun the nanofibers. To attach the pGLO plasmids to the nanofibers, we poured the polymer and the pGLO into the conductive distribution cone and allowed the solution to spin until it was gone. To integrate the plasmids spun into the nanofibers into E.coli, we followed our transformation procedure. After the transformation was complete and the pGLO had been allowed to grow, we analyzed the data. We determined that at time zero, the DNA was stabilized. We determined that after four days, the DNA was stabilized because we had one colony transformed. Even though we were not able to calculate transformation efficiency, we were successful in integrating the pGLO that was attached to the nanofibers into E. coli. Due to this, we can accept our expected hypothesis and reject our null.

This project’s goal are to detect and find the amount of formaldehyde in different brands of textile samples and diapers , to check that the amount of formaldehyde exceeds the standards of formaldehyde, and to find a way in order to decrease the amount of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a hazardous chemical causing skin, eye and respiratory irritation and can cause dermatitis. Formaldehyde has been declared a Priority Existing Chemical (PEC) under section 51 of the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. The use of formaldehyde in MDF particle boards, synthetic resins, paints, dye stuffs and in textile treatment, to give only a few examples, makes the matter of measuring formaldehyde concentrations in the everyday atmosphere of great importance. The hypothesis of this project was to show that some brands of cloth or textile exceed the standard of amount of formaldehyde on textile. Nash reagent was used to dissolve evaporated formaldehyde from taken textile samples. We put the samples into sealed jars with Nash reagent and then incubated at a controlled temperature for a specified length of time. The amount of formaldehyde absorbed by the solution was then determined by spectrophotometer. Data showed that in some countries the amount of formaldehyde exceeds the standards of formaldehyde. We tried to determine/find a way in order to decrease the amount of formaldehyde in textiles. This research will be used to aid in developing better techniques to remove formaldehyde from materials. <br><br>

Philippine Science High School -- Main Campus, Quezon City, Philippines

Biofilms are sessile layers of microorganisms that attach to surfaces. Biofilms cause serious health detriments – urinary tract infection, bloody diarrhea and contamination of indwelling medical devices – present antibiotics cannot treat. <br><br> Effects of juices containing proanthocyanidin – apple, grape, tomato and pear – on the biofilm formation of E. coli and S. aureus were tested. The juices were incubated at room temperature with diluted bacterial cultures on a microplate for three days. Then, wells were washed, stained and rinsed. The remaining stains in the wells, proportional to the amount of biofilm in each, were measured using Totallab’s Image Analysis software instead of a spectrophotometer, to compare treated and untreated cultures. This innovation is inexpensive, more convenient and less prone to errors. <br><br> Statistical tests showed that treatments with apple, tomato and pear juices significantly decreased the biofilm formation of both microorganisms. While grape juice stimulated S. aureus biofilm, it inhibited E. coli’s. Through further tests, treated E. coli were found to exhibit inactive fimbriae and decreased mobility, which may explain the mechanisms of the juices’ inhibition. Observed changes in colony growth patterns of E. coli and S. aureus may also have affected both microorganisms’ biofilm forming properties and explain why grape juice stimulated the biofilm formation of S. aureus.<br><br> Through this research, apple, tomato and pear juices were proven effective in inhibiting biofilm formation of E. coli and S. aureus, thus, making these juices possible treatments for illnesses these biofilms cause. Furthermore, a systematic, fast and easy way of studying biofilms has been established.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF SUPPRESSING GENES ON LYSOSOMAL PRODUCTION IN WILD TYPE AND CUP-5 MUTANT C. ELEGANS AS A MODEL FOR THE HUMAN DISEASE MUCOLIPIDOSIS TYPE IV
Marilynn Tedja, Elise Adcock, Elizabeth Monier
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX USA

To study human diseases, scientists use model organisms such as C. elegans to isolate genes for research. Abnormal programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is the origin of many diseases. Increased apoptotic cell death occurs in cup-5 mutated worms when the “protector gene,” ced-9, becomes inactivated, resulting in more lysosomes to digest the dead and dying molecules. This accumulation of lipid and polysaccharide material in lysosomes causes the human neurological disease Mucolipidosis type IV (ML-IV).<br><br> The purpose of this project was to effectively suppress ced-4, egl-41, cup-5, and nuc-1 using interference RNA (iRNA) in wild type and cup-5 mutant (MT9454) C. elegans, to determine the effects of gene suppression on lysosomal production, and to increase the lifespan of the MT9454 worms by suppressing genes related to programmed cell death—creating an effective model organism to replicate ML-IV. This experiment included four procedures. Procedure one consisted of the preparation of solutions used during experimentation. Procedure two dealt with iRNA induction in the worms to suppress targeted genes. Procedures three and four involved gel analysis of protein production and fluorescence microscopy of lysosomal production in LysoTracker Red treated organisms. <br><br> Lifespan analysis often reflected the effects of lysosomal accumulation in comparison to the wild type control worms. Increased lysosomal production resulted in a shorter lifespan. Using the cup-5 mutant worm control as the model for the human disease Mucolipidosis Type IV, it was determined that the suppression of ced-4 and egl-41 of this mutant strain not only increased lifespan, but also reduced lysosomal accumulation.<br><br>

USE OF ASCORBIC ACID ON DENTAL PLAQUE TO FAVOR THE GROWTH OF BENEFICIAL BACTERIA OVER PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
Angel Omar Sáez, Jean-Louis Rochet
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, Puerto Rico, U.S.A

Human dental plaque contains many bacteria; some beneficial while others pathogenic. There is a delicate balance between the two, which can be easily altered by external factors, such as poor oral hygiene. The purpose of this investigation was to find out if ascorbic acid, acting as a redox agent, could alter the balance of these bacteria by favoring the mostly aerobic beneficial bacteria over the mostly anaerobic pathogenic bacteria. The samples were taken by periodontist from 10 adults with stage 1 or 2 periodontitis and were incubated in TSB tubes. After incubation, the samples were inoculated into three different media (plate count, blood and MacConkey agars). Gram stain, oxidase and catalase tests were performed on the bacteria, and then they were identified by the BBL Crystal Method.<br><br> The hypothesis was neither supported nor rejected by the results because anaerobic bacteria were not present in any of the dental plaque samples. Instead, most of the bacteria found were facultative anaerobes. All of the identified bacteria were opportunistic pathogens and 64% of them were also nosocomial. From the experimental samples, to which the ascorbic acid solution was added, only one bacterium, Enterococcus faecium, survived. The following was concluded based on the results: (1) ascorbic acid is an effective dental plaque bactericide, and (2) the bactericidal effect observed was probably due to ascorbic acid’s acidity. As an application of this investigation, ascorbic acid could be used to lower the risk of infection or disease from dental plaque bacteria, especially for hospital patients. <br><br>

DOES AN OXIDANT STRESS, H2O2, PRODUCED BY GLUCOSE OXIDASE (IN VITRO), DIRECTLY CAUSE INSULIN RESISTANCE?
Krystle Violet Potter, Ariel Leigh Potter
Rio Rico High School, Rio Rico, Arizona, USA

Type 2 diabetes is a debilitating disease that results from an insufficient amount of glucose entering the cell. Insulin resistance is a condition that exists prior to type 2 diabetes causing cells to become unresponsive to insulin’s effort to allow glucose to enter the cell. <br><br> Oxidative stress has been implicated in many diseases. Thus, the purpose of this project was to analyze the effect of an oxidative stress on cellular mechanisms that may become comprised resulting in insulin resistance namely, the insulin receptor, the uptake of glucose by the cell, and glycogen synthase activity. <br><br> We performed the GLUT-4 Protein Determination by Gel Electrophoresis protocol according to standard methodology. The data that we analyzed was collected by lab assistants in a university muscle metabolism laboratory using the following three protocols: GLUT-4 Protein Determination by Gel Electrophoresis, 2-Dioxyglucose Uptake, and Glycogen Synthase Assay. We analyzed the raw data and the significance of differences between the multiple groups was assessed using an ANOVA test with a post hoc Fisher’s test. <br><br> The results indicate that when insulin or an oxidant stress is added individually to cells, there is a significant increase in insulin receptor phosophorylation, glucose transport, and glycogen synthase activity. Consequently, it was expected that there would be an additive effect when both insulin and the oxidant stress were added simultaneously. The results show an unexpected significant decreased effect on insulin receptor phosophorylation, glucose transport, and glycogen synthase activity. This provides evidence that an oxidant stress directly causes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in vitro. <br><br>

THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN IN THE EFFECT OF THE CHOROID PLEXUS ON CORTICAL NEURONS
Lauren Nicole Toub, Anjuli Patricia Kannan
Yorktown High School, Yorktown, New York, United States

The choroid plexus is a bundle of blood vessels located in the ventricles of the brain that produces and secretes cerebrospinal fluid. Recent studies have shown that it is rich in nerve growth factors that affet neuronal survival, differentiation, and proliferation. This research focused on the effect of the choroid plexus on cortical neurons from the embryonic mouse brain. The neurons were cultured either alone or atop choroid plexus explants for several days and then stained for the axon and dendrite markers <br><br>B-tubulin III and MAP2. As hypothesized, those co-cultured with the choroid plexus demonstrated greater process outgrowth, which is a good indication of a neuron's health and level of differentiation. To determine what growth factors in the choroid plexus might be causing the positive effects on the neurons, explants were stained for BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, and NT-3. All four stains were positive. Next, each of these factors was blocked through neutralizing antibodies in an attempt to inhibit their effects. However, blocking the proteins did not significantly reduce process outgrowth in the neurons. Future research into what specific proteins are causing the neurons to grow longer and more numerous processes may provide the foundation for treatments of brain and spinal injury as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

ANTIOXIDANTS IN COMBINATION WITH CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER
Lauren Christine Hughes, Sara Posey
Hilton Head Preparatory School

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate red raspberry, noni, and grape seed extracts as antioxidants to supplement chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Graviola, a non-toxic substitute for the chemotherapy agent Adriamycin, was used.<br><br> To perform the experiment, test tubes were divided into two groups, one containing basal cell carcinomas, and the other containing healthy dermal cells. A soy protein broth was used to represent human fluid, and different combinations of the antioxidants and graviola were added to the test tubes in amounts proportional to the recommended daily dosage for an average human. After forty-eight hours incubation, the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. <br><br> As compared to the control, the cancer cells that contained a combination of antioxidants and graviola had a 64.5% decrease in the number of cells, while the healthy cells with these combinations had a 17% increase in the number of cells. The most effective combination was graviola with red raspberry and grape seed. This combination killed a high percentage of cancer cells and stimulated an increase in the amount of healthy cells. In conclusion, the combination of graviola, red raspberry, and grape seed could be effective as a treatment for basal cell carcinoma.<br><br>

SHOULD YOU MICROWAVE PLASTICS?
Trisha Lea Schleich, Terra Jo Toribio
Mitchell High School, Mitchell, SD, USA

Plastics pervade today's society but are they safe for microwave cooking? To find out, we exposed the California blackworm (Lumbriculus variegatus)to various plastics that had been heated in a typical microwave oven. Due to its sensitivity to the environment, this organism can provide a rigorous test that common plastics are indeed "microwave safe". We began our tests by placing samples of common plastics into spring water which we then microwaved for one minute and set to cool. One-centimeter blackworm segments in the head and tail sections were counted.<br><br>We expected that a one-way ANOVA would show no significant differences in regeneration rates between our plastics since they are widely used in microwave ovens without any noticeable ill effects. We were wrong. There was significant (p = 0.019) reduction in the head segment regeneration rates of segments exposed to high density polyethylene and medical tubing (polyvinyl chloride). There were also significant differences (p < .001) between the tail segment regeneration rates of polyethylene terephthalate (common to injection molded containers) and low density polyethylene (common to flexible lids and plastic wraps). An extension of this project would include an analysis of the chemical makeup of the water after microwaving it in various plastics to see what substances might be affecting our worms -- and possibly people as well.

CIRCADIAN STAGE-DEPENDENT EFFECTS OF EXERCISING ON THE TIME STRUCTURE OF BLOOD PRESSURE
Richie Kimlong Huynh, Ryan Kimlong Huynh
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, Minnesota, United States

This study’s purpose was to examine any circadian stage-dependent (time-of-day) effect of exercise on the time structure of blood pressure and heart rate. Chronobiological studies have shown that most variables vary as a function of time, and that abnormalities in blood pressure variability have an important diagnostic value. Among many factors affecting blood pressure, exercise is known to have beneficial long term affects on cardiovascular health. Fourteen students measured their blood pressure and heart rate automatically at half-hour intervals for five weeks with an ambulatory monitor. Students followed an exercising procedure (jump ropes, curl-ups, push-ups) daily at one of six different times of day during the last four weeks. Improvement in exercise performance was assessed by linear regressions. Student and paired t-tests compared endpoints between genders or values obtained before and after exercise. Circadian stage-dependence of any effect of exercise was tested by a one-way analysis of variance. Females were found to have a higher heart rate than males (p=0.022). The increase in performance of curl-ups and jump ropes tended to be greater among students exercising in the afternoon or in the morning, respectively. The extent of predictable daily change in systolic blood pressure changed to a larger extent among students exercising around noon (p=0.038). As anticipated, some effects of exercise were circadian stage-dependent, offering the possibility of optimizing its effects both for health benefits and performance. This is important for improving lifestyles and for the rehabilitation of cardiac and other patients, in addition to applications in sports medicine.

Ana Debora Nunes Pinheiro, Samuel Verter Marinho Uchoa Lopes
Colegio Christus, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil

The medicinal plants present a pharmacological potential by their different properties. Momordica charantia L. (Cucurbitaceae) fruits have been used to treat gastric lesions, however the gastroprotective activity from its leaves is unknown. In order to evaluate the anti-ulcerative effect an ethanolic extract (EE) from M. charantia var microcarpa leaves was prepared.to evaluate the gastroprotective potential of the etahnolic estrac, tissues from Swiss mice, obteined from a qualified scientist, that ahd been treated with 0,2ml of EE (10 and 100 mg/kg) or saline (positive control), were anayzed for the pH (tornassol papaer, Merck), stomach volume and protein gastric mucus(mg/ml), Bradford, 595mm) evaluation. The results are presented as mean ± S.E. The ethanol promote bleeding, hyperemia and multiple, elongated, reddish bands of lesions in the gastric mucosa. Phytochemical screening to EE revealed presence of free steroids, alkaloids and saponins. Results of lesions scores, pH, volume and proteins were, respectively: Positive control - 74±27.7; 4.33±1.03; 32.00±9.77; 0.02±0.23, EE 10 mg/Kg - 25±35.4; 5.70±1.33; 182.00±125.23; 0.89±0.45; EE 100 mg/Kg – 35.2±16.8; 4.77±1.78; 283.33±150.00; 1.88±0.50. EE 10 and 100 mg/Kg reduced the lesions at 66% and 53% and increased the mucus production at 4450% and 9400%, respectively. These results suggest that EE of M. charantia leaves have gastroprotective activity.

PROTEOMICS ANALYSIS OF OSTEOSARCOMA CELLS
Lalith Kumar Polepeddi, Michael McCord Polmear
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO, USA

Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent tumor in dogs and a devastating human cancer, but its pathogenesis is unknown. The objective of this project is to explore the role of a known tumor suppressor, beta-catenin, in tumorigenesis and progression. Beta-catenin is of interest because it interacts with adhesion molecules, with transcription factors, and with cytosolic protein complexes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway important for growth and differentiation. It was hypothesized that beta-catenin function may be compromised in osteosarcoma cells and that this may be reflected in a decrease in beta-catenin level in these cells. To test the hypothesis, cell homogenates from canine osteosarcoma tissue samples were prepared and subfractionated into a cytosolic division and a high-speed pellet enriched in phospholipids. Tumor stroma cells, used as controls, were processed in the same manner. The proteins in both fractions, from the tumor cells and the control cells, were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto membranes, and probed with an antibody to beta-catenin. Quantitative analysis with a multi-modal imager revealed that beta-catenin was reduced by about 1.54 times in the supernatant of cancer cells compared to the supernatant of control cells. Beta-catenin immunoprecipitation revealed discrepancies in binding complexes to this tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma versus normal cells. Additional experiments will assess methods for treating cancer by using a polymeric encapsulation strategy and viral cancer therapies. While the results were obtained from one tumor sample only, they are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in beta-catenin level/function are involved in osteosarcoma pathogenesis.

<br><br> Would the condition of the respiratory tract improve by decreasing the contamination of pigeon(Columba livia) excrement? The formulated hypothesis is if the contamination of pigeon excrement is eliminated, the students with asthma, respiratory difficulties and nasal allergies will notice an improvement of their condition. A questionnaire was validated, administered, tabulated and analyzed. Finally, a comparison was made between results of Phase I and those obtained in Phase II.<br><br>As a result of the previous investigation some things were done to prevent pigeons from dwelling in the school.In Phase II smaller amounts of excrements were detected on walls.Smaller amount of excrements were responsible for the percentage reduction of related symptoms such as: headaches 17%, nausea 16%, stomachache 17%, colds 12%, respiratory problems 13%, sore throat 22%, cough 6%, itchy throat 20%. There was a percentage reduction health in conditions that were activated with the excrements: sinus congestion 1%, asthma 15%, and nasal allergies 8%. <br><br>Teachers that worked on contaminated classrooms showed a decrease in the following symptoms: sore throat 60%, breathing difficulty 10%, sneezing 10%, skin rashes with itching 10%. There was no change in the incidence of hoarse voice it remained on a 20% incidence.<br><br>The results showed that pigeon’s excrements is a condition affected teachers and students. After the investigation it was suggested to the school administrator that it’s necessary to avoid further contamination with pigeon’s excrements. Phase II reflected a significant decreased on the symptoms prevailing on students and teachers.

THE EFFECTS OF CINNAMON ON FACTORS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Holly Ann Wonders, Morgan Rae Rummel
Delavan High School, Delavan, Illinois, United States of America

Cardiovascular Disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States for over a century. Leading risk factors for CVD include high cholesterol, high LDL, high triglycerides, low HDL, and high VLDL. Cinnamon has been found to stimulate insulin receptor sites to remove glucose from blood enabling cells to metabolize lipids more readily for energy. This study investigated the effect of commercial cinnamon on blood serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL and VLDL.<br><br> Two groups of six human subjects in good health were used in the study. The experimental group ingested 2 grams of cinnamon in the form of two capsules (500 mg each) twice daily for 42 days. The control group ingested the same amounts of wheat flour as a placebo. Subjects were instructed to eat and exercise as normal. Blood samples were taken on days 0, 21, 42, and 63 and analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and VLDL. <br><br> Analysis of the raw data showed that 67% of the experimental group saw an average drop in total cholesterol and LDL. HDL increased among 67% of the experimental group. The average drop in cholesterol was 9.3% and the average drop in LDL was 12.5%. Triglycerides were lowered by an average of 15% in 83% of the experimental group. Similarly, 83% of the experimental group had an average drop in VLDL of 14%. Statistical analysis of the data showed that there was a significant variation of the data among subjects, which was most likely due to the sample size and variation among subjects' diet and exercise. In conclusion, the research conducted was substantial and additional research is warranted. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF TRICHOSTATIN A ON LONGEVITY, METABOLISM, AND REPRODUCTION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Michael Jay Levy, Alexander Egan
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, New York, United States

While the American Federation for Ageing Research spent $63 million toward research of treatments for age-related diseases, little money has been directed toward research of treatments retarding the onset of diseases. Delaying of age-related diseases means the increase of productivity by the ageing population. A 1% increase in productivity adds $1 billion to the U.S. economy. A by-product of cellular respiration, ageing is caused by accumulation of non-active enzymes/proteins; cytochrome-c in mitochondria causes free-radical production, ultimately damages neurons. Histone-deacetylase inhibitors promote the expression of genes by stopping histone deacetylation. Histone deacetylation adds the affinity between the DNA and the histone. This blocks transcription. This experiment investigates the effects of Trichostatin A on longevity, metabolism, and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster. Two groups, one consisting of 10uM TSA and the other consisting of a normal food medium, were exposed to no, 10, 20 and 40 min. UV-B, which was used to create oxidative stress. The metabolic rate based on the activity of the drosophila, fecundity based on the amount of eggs laid, lifespan based on fly counts, and chromosomal observations vis a vis dissection of the salivary glands and fuschin stained under a micro-dissecting scope were the variables investigated. Results suggested that TSA promoted hsp22 gene transcription and chromatin morphology. Longevity was most significant when compared to THA followed by exposure of UV-B radiation of 20 minutes. Future research includes rtPCR of the hsp22, p53, and EcR gene, vibrant apoptosis and free radical assay, and using INDY mutant flies.

THE USE OF ESSENTIAL OILS OF CAMU CAMU AND EUCALYPTUS; AND THE COLORING OF ACHIOTE IN ELABORATION OF NATURAL PRODUCTS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ASTHMATIC PROBLEMS
María Jimena Márquez Palacios, Karla Alexandra Monier Bautista
San Antonio de Padua, Lima-Lima, Perú

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the use of natural colorings and flavors doesn’t cause bronchial problems to people with asthma and create a technological process for the elaboration of candies with natural colorings and flavors that present functional properties. <br><br> <br><br> We used the flow of essential extraction oil process using distillation with vapor and water, to extract the essence of the flavor of the Camu Camu and the Eucalypti. It was also used an extraction with ethanol to obtain a coloring starting from seeds of achiote that would replace the tartrazine. A quantity of 3 ml was obtained, enough for the elaboration of the candy. <br><br> <br><br> By means of a simple process, preparing water, glucose and the essential oil a candy with healthy properties was obtained. This candy not only contributes to the prevention of breathing problems but also offers nutritious properties, since the camu-camu contains great quantity of ascorbic acid and the eucalyptus is useful to treat lung affections, colds or asthma attacks. As a result, the asthmatic volunteers didn't present breathing problems when consuming this product such as the ones presented with the commercial candy. <br><br> <br><br> Being a similar and healthy substitute for the tartrazine, this project contributes to the alimentary industry; people who suffer from breathing problems can continue consuming products of its preference without damaging their health.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS ANTI-OXIDANTS ON PARKINSON'S MODEL DROSOPHILA
Scott Philip Yakaitis, Jeff Qiu
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, New York, United States

In the United States, at least 500,000 people are believed to suffer from Parkinson's disease, and about 50,000 new cases are reported annually (National Institute of Neruological Disorders and Stroke). Parkinson’s disease has been linked to mitochondrial aging based on the free-radical theory of aging. Therefore, if one could control mitochondrial aging in patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease, the Parkinson’s disease symptoms should decrease (Pollack, 2001). The oxidants that are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s include MPTP and MPP+ (Fukushima, 2004). These oxidants cause mitochondria to initiate internal apoptosis once they reach the level of toxicity. Lipoic acid and COQ 10 have both been found to act as anti-oxidants. COQ 10 has been shown to decrease parkinson’s symptoms while lipoic acid has yet to be shown to do that. However COQ 10 has also been found to decrease life span while lipoic acid increases lifespan (Driver, 2002). To decrease adverse effects, a cocktail of lipoic acid and COQ 10 has been introduced into a Parkin model organism. The cocktail of lipoic acid and COQ 10 did reduce the symptoms of Parkinson’s in the model organisms. In addition, they reduced them slightly better than COQ 10 alone. However, the cocktail did not raise lifespan high enough. They still remain below normal. The difference was only 1% but it was found to be statistically significant. To continue this study, fruit fly brains will be stained to determine varying levels of apoptosis at certain key stages in the organism’s development to determine if the medication is affecting apoptosis and not another mechanism.

NEW CANCER GENE? ANALYZING MUTATIONS IN PROTEIN KINASES THAT INDUCE CANCER
Arif Ali Awan, Hamza Mohaimeen Bari
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Protein kinases are enzymes that are responsible for regulating the signaling pathways, which are important for neoplasia including cell proliferation, adhesion, survival and motility. To determine which kinases are expressed and altered in tumorigenesis, we carried out a bioinformatics analysis of various cancer tissues for kinase expression and potential mutations associated with these kinases. The databases of ESTs, which contain different types of cancers, were obtained. With the aid of bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, we identified that brain cancer had the highest number of expressed kinases when compared to other cancers. Practical Extraction and Report Language (PERL), a computer programming language, was used to identify mutations in the kinases by comparing the wild type sequences with the ones expressed in cancer. Four kinases were found to be expressed in several of the brain tumor EST libraries (patients), which were the prk, crk, cak and mak kinases. In addition, we identified three cluster mutations as hot spots on three particular regions of the prk kinase. These mutations are non-randomly distributed. Moreover, these mutations repeatedly occur across brain tumor tissues of multiple patients. Molecular modeling was used to check the functional importance of the conserved mutations. PCR followed by gel electrophoresis was used to identify expression of these four kinases in the cancerous brain tissue samples of mice. Identification of expression and hotspot mutations in these kinases of brain cancer opens the door to novel screening methods as well as development of targeted molecular anti-cancer therapy.

CYCLOOXYGENASE INHIBITION IN OVARIAN CANCER PROGRESSION
Julia B. Zvenigorodsky, Jasmine Vlahos
Central High School, Philadelphia PA, United States 

This experiment explores the influence of Cox-2 inhibition on expression and growth properties of ovarian normal and cancer cells. Cyclooxygenase is an enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins, which in turn work as messengers in the immune system’s inflammatory response to infection. It was hypothesized that after the initial Cox-2 inhibition, through genetic alterations in the DNA, the gene causing ovarian cancer (in mice) would be silenced. <br><br> Matings performed by qualified scientist were done in order to pass the knockout gene to the offspring. Cox-2 (+/-) mice were mated with Cox-2 (+/-) mice. This resulted in both Cox-2 (+/-) and Cox-2 (-/-) mice. Tissues were then supplied to the student researchers by the supervising scientist. The ovaries were embedded in wax and sectioned. Slides were prepared and microscopy was performed. <br><br> Mice with a complete knockout of Cox-2 (-/-) exhibited a smaller percentage of ovarian tumor recovery. Six ovaries were studied in mice with complete Cox-2 knockout and of those six, only two displayed significant ovary rescue. It was found that mice with a partial knockout of Cox-2 (+/-) demonstrated a higher percentage of ovary revival. Twenty-four ovaries with partial Cox-2 knockout were examined and of those twenty-four, eighteen illustrated significant ovary recovery. <br><br> Reasoning for such occurrences is that when Cox-2 is completely removed from the body Cox-1 is signaled to compensate for the deficient enzyme. When Cox-2 is partial knocked out, or removed from the body Cox-1 is not triggered to compensate for Cox-2. <br><br>

FRUCTOSE: THE NEW GLUCOSE? THE EFFECTS OF HIGH LEVELS OF FRUCTOSE ON FIBRONECTIN PRODUCTION IN RAT MESANGIAL CELLS
Dana Murphy Ullrich, Emily Ager
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

High glucose concentrations in diabetes increase fibronectin synthesis, which scars the kidney and causes renal failure. However, it is not known whether fructose also has deleterious effects on the kidneys. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of high concentrations of fructose on fibronectin synthesis by rat mesangial cells. This experiment will determine whether or not high (30 mM) fructose concentrations cause rat mesangial cells to produce more fibronectin than normal (5 mM) fructose concentrations. It is known that concentrations of 30 mM glucose cause cells to produce more fibronectin than concentrations of 5 mM glucose. In order to perform this experiment, rat mesangial cells were plated in growth media in four different wells with an equal number of cells in each well and incubated for 24 hours. Then the cells were switched to test media, containing either 5 mM glucose, 30 mM glucose, 5 mM fructose, or 30 mM fructose. The 30 mM fructose media immediately killed the cells, so it was lowered to 10 mM fructose. The cells were incubated for 24 hours. The conditioned media was aspirated and the protein in each medium was measured with a protein assay. The media proteins were then separated according to their size by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A second gel was run and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated with an antibody to fibronectin. Bound antibody was then incubated with a second antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence on x-ray film. Bands on the film were quantified by scanning the bands and measuring their relative densities. The film showed that 10 mM fructose caused the cells to produce significantly more fibronectin than the normal concentration of fructose (5 mM). Therefore, fructose can potentially lead to scarring of the kidneys.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF EGFR INHIBITORS ALONE AND IN COMBINATION ON THE GROWTH OF CANCER CELL LINES
Libby Freya Boscoe, Shane Alexa Renee Kleinstein
RMHA, Denver CO, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of three EGFR inhibitors, ZD1839, ZD6474, and C225 alone and in combination on the growth of two Lung Cancer cell lines, H322 and H157, and two Head and Neck Cancer cell lines, UMSCC2 and UMSCC19, and to determine if any of the combinations act synergistically. The hypothesis was that ZD6474 and ZD1839 in combination would be most effective on all cell lines. The degree of growth inhibition was determined using an MTT assay. This viability assay depends on the reduction of MTT by living, metabolically active cells to form a formazan complex. To determine the reduction of phosphorylation of the EGFR receptor site and the map kinase receptor sites caused by the different agents, a western blot was performed. The western blots proved the hypothesis accepted for all cancer cell lines, except cell lines UMSCC2 and UMSCC19. For cell line UMSCC2, the combination of C225 and ZD1839 was most effective in reducing phosphorylation of EGFR. For cell line UMSCC19, ZD6474 and C225 in combination were most effective in reducing the phosphorylation of map kinase. The results obtained from the MTT assay show the hypothesis was accepted as to the effectiveness of ZD6474 and ZD1839 on all cancer cell lines. However, while the combinations proved effective in inhibiting the growth of the cancer cell lines and reducing phosphorylation, both the MTT assay and the western blot data showed that there were little positive synergistic effects.

EFFECTS OF FOLATE SUPPLEMENTATION ON MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION IN RADIATION-DAMAGED HUMAN KERATINOCYTES
Kyla Davis Horn
Cocoa Beach Junior/Senior High School, Cocoa Beach, Florida, USA

This project examined whether folate supplementation would enhance restoration of mitochondrial function in radiation-damaged human dermal keratinocytes. It was hypothesized that cells treated with supplemental folate would have greater mitochondrial function following ultraviolet radiation exposure than would those without folate supplementation, as measured by a mitochondrial transmembrane potential assay.<br><br> HaCaT human dermal keratinocytes were cultured in vitro to confluence and subcultured to achieve sufficient quantities. Seven identical cultures were established for each trial. Six groups were exposed to full-spectrum ultraviolet (UV) for 30 seconds to induce mitochondrial damage. Groups were established as follows: Control (no UV, no folate supplementation), UV/ no folate supplementation, and five irradiated folate supplementation groups at the following levels: 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, and 300%. Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Medium was replaced three times per week.<br><br> An assay of mitochondrial apoptosis was performed using a cationic dye (C25H27Cl4IN4) that fluoresces differently in healthy and apoptotic cells. (The dye aggregates in the mitochondria of healthy cells and glows red; since it cannot aggregate in the altered mitochondria of apoptotic cells, it remains in the cytoplasm and fluoresces green.) Three samples from each culture were examined by fluorescent microscopy (21 samples per trial). Healthy and apoptotic cells from each group were counted. Procedures were repeated for three trials, with a total of 63 samples examined.<br><br> In all three trials, the 200% folate supplementation group had the greatest percentage of healthy cells. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed that the results were significant (p<.01).

MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS IN SOUTHERN OREGON
Claire Elizabeth Glasgow
Henley High School, Klamath Falls OR, USA

My project compared local mushrooms to well-known edible and medicinal mushrooms in terms of natural killer (NK) cell activation and induction of tumor cell death.<br><br>I wanted to test the immune enhancing properties of something growing in my environment. I decided to examine mushrooms, since some mushroom species are used in complementary cancer treatment. Given the immune-activating properties of compounds in mushroom cells and cell walls, I hypothesize that extracts of local edible mushrooms will activate some NK cells.<br><br>I collected many mushrooms, and bought three. I selected 6 for testing, including the well-studied Shiitake. I purified lymphocytes from healthy blood, and tested extracts from all 6 mushrooms. I used 3 antibodies: CD3 stains T cells, CD56 stains T and NK cells, and CD69 stains activated T and NK cells. Using flow cytometry, I gated on CD3- CD56+ NK cells. Then I compared degree of activation by looking at CD69 levels. <br><br>I also looked at the effects my extracts had on the growth and death of the K562 tumor cell line. I stained the cell membranes with PKH67, a fluorescent marker. When a cell divides, it only gets half of the fluorescence. This allows me to track cell division. <br><br>Most of the mushroom extracts activated some NK cells. Also, most of the extracts had some effect on K562 tumor cell viability. The morel mushroom had the strongest effect on the NK cells, and also inhibited K562 growth. <br><br>I was excited that a local mushroom would activate NK cells so proficiently.

LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATUS AND TOBACCO SMOKE WITH INFLUENCES OF NATURAL TEA REMEDIES
Natasha Rosales
McArthur High School, Hollywood, Florida, U.S.A.

In the U.S. alone, there are 8.6 million people that have at least one serious illness caused by smoking, those illnesses combined cost the U.S. $150 billion dollars each year. To subdue the effects of this addictive epidemic the use of the second most popular drink in the world is turned towards. Green tea and yerba mate tea are focused on due to their possible remedial effects stemming from their chain-smoking countries, Japan, and Argentina. The pulsations of Lumbriculus variegatus(California blackworm), a transparent freshwater annelid, served as a model for the human body's circulatory system. By testing the effects of green tea, yerba mate tea, and smoking in various orders which overlap each other ,it was conceived by using a t-test that since, TS = 2.115 > T05 = 2.064, reject null with a probability greater than .0001 for smoking before green tea. Since TS = -.9292 < T05 = 2.064, do not reject null with a probability greater than .20 for green tea before smoking. Since TS = 5.792 > T05 = 2.064, reject null with a probability greater than .0001 for smoking before yerba mate tea. Since TS = -8.503< T05 = 2.064, do not reject null with a probability greater than .20 for yerba mate tea before smoking.100 samples were tested, 5 trials within each of the four styles of testing. Results depict, when the adversities took their toll on the pulsation rate of the blackworm they can be reversed with the influence of tea. Yerba mate tea proved to be stronger, improving the reduced pulsation rates caused by smoking compared to green tea.

IS THERE AN INVERSE CORRELATION BETWEEN CANCER AND HEART DISEASE?
Brian Edward Clement
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States

Endothelial progenitor cells are crucial for tumor neovascularization. Recent studies have shown that cholesterol reduces their number, impairs their function, and inhibits their migratory activity.<br><br> An epidemiological study was conducted to investigate whether the incidence of cancer was lower in the heart disease patient population than in the normal population. In 2003, 140 out of 3,033 heart disease patients were found to have cancer, compared to the 6.6% of people in the normal population with cancer (P = 5.391 x 10^ -6 ). In 2004, 131 out of 2,885 heart disease patients were found to have cancer, compared to the 7.0% of people in the normal population with cancer (P = 1.129 x 10^ -7 ).<br><br> A second study was then conducted to assess the converse – whether the incidence of heart disease was lower in the cancer patient population than in the normal population. In 2003, 27 out of 2,616 cancer patients were found to have heart disease, compared to the 5.8% of people in the normal population with heart disease (P = 0). In 2004, 24 out of 2,554 cancer patients were found to have heart disease, compared to the 6.3% of the normal population with heart disease (P = 0).<br><br> The results of this study expose an inverse correlation between the incidence of cancer and heart disease. With the P-value of all cases being P < .05, the results are in fact significant.<br><br>

NOVEL GENE THERAPY ON INNER/MIDDLE EAR OF POMPE'S DISEASE MICE
Kushagra Shrinath
Vanguard High School, Ocala Florida, United States

Pompe’s Disease results from a defective copy of acid alpha-glucosidase, the gene which encodes for the enzyme essential in breaking down glycogen. Although protein therapy can break down the glycogen of human infants in the most crucially affected areas and prolong their lives, it has been unable to reduce buildup in the inner/middle ear which has resulted in severe hearing loss. In this study, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is designed that will allow for a gene to be expressed in those areas.<br><br>The first step was to ascertain where in the ear glycogen buildup occurs. PAS stains were performed on various ear samples of a wild-type and Pompe's mouse to show areas of buildup. It was shown that buildup occurs in the stapes, stapedius, and ear canal. Next, it was to be determined if non-surgical administration of EBD blue dye can reach the inner/middle ear. After being given removed parts of the ear from mentor, qualitative analysis was done to see extent of penetration of dye, which reached the stapes, stapedius, as well as parts of the cochlea. Finally, it was to see if a delivered transgene using AAV can be expressed in those areas penetrated by the dye. After being given ear samples of a wild-type mouse that had been administered by mentor with lacZ, stains on beta-galactosidase were done but little of the transgene was shown in the stains.<br><br>In this study, it was concluded that glycogen buildup occurs in the stapes, stapedius, and ear canal of Pompe's Disease mice, that through non-surgical administration, it is possible to reach those areas, but that a delivered transgene has a difficult time expressing in the inner/middle ear.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY (CRT) WITH SEQUENTIAL BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKER IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
Shivam Narendra Upadhyaya
Stranahan High School, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, United States of America

Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is the fastest-growing cardiac disease entity in the United States, affecting 2% of the population. CHF is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. CHF has an enormous economic impact on the U.S. health care system due to direct medical costs, disability, and loss of employment. In the United States, the estimated annual cost of CHF is $60 billion. Once heart failure is diagnosed, the prognosis is poor. The overall 1-year mortality in patients with severe heart failure may be as high as 35% to 40%. In the United States alone, approximately 250,000 patients die of heart failure each year. In severe CHF most medical therapies aim at correcting the effects of severe cardiomyopathy without affecting the root cause of the problem: Dyssynchrony in heart muscle, which is severely weak and contracts ineffectively. Patients with ventricular dyssynchrony usually experience conduction impairments that cause their ventricles to contract at abnormal patterns. When this occurs it can cause a reduced diastolic filling time, weakened contractility, protracted mitral regurgitation, and post-systolic regional contraction, making the whole process inefficient and counterproductive. CRT stimulates the heart’s chambers—particularly the lower chambers—to beat simultaneously and helps the restoration of ventricular activation and contraction in order to improve cardiac function (EF), which in turn helps to improve the efficacy of an individual and quality of life. The researcher participated in the study by providing patient education (with supervision), monitored evaluations (i.e. 6 minute walk/quality of life questionnaire), and observed scans and pacemaker interrogations.

MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF SMOKING EFFECT ON DOWN SYNDROME
Daniel Zheng
Saint Paul Academy and Summit School, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States

The purpose of this project is to study the controversial relationship between cigarette smoking and the risk for Down syndrome birth. A biologically-based model is used to describe the effect of smoking on oocyte pool reduction and survival of Down syndrome fetuses during pregnancy. The numerical solutions of the nonlinear-differential equations present in the model are obtained with the Runge-Kutta method. A goal-seeking module available from a spreadsheet program is used to analyze published Down syndrome data and to estimate the unknown parameter values. From the established risk model, we discover that, if cigarette smoking kills oocytes in the resting pool, the risk for Down syndrome conception will be increased. However, the magnitude of the risk change will be small (peak relative risk is about 2.0) and practically detectable only after 15-20 years of smoking. If cigarette smoking also increases spontaneous abortion of affected fetuses, the speculated oocyte-killing effect will become even more difficult to detect. We suggest that future studies should include large numbers of long-term smokers and women who quit smoking before pregnancy in order to better understand the effect of smoking on Down syndrome conception.

SUBLUXATION SPLINT: A NEW HIP BRACE FOR INFANTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP
Shelby R Doyle
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK, USA

The purpose of this project was to create and build a better splint to use to treat infants with Developmental Dylplasia of the Hip (DDH), a condition that causes new born infants to have a femur that can sublux, or slip out of the pelvic socket, due to a looseness of the supporting structures. This is treated with a splint that holds the hip joint in place. The currently used splint, the Pavlik Harness, is difficult to use, which can affect parental compliance. A new, easier-to-use splint could improve compliance and treatment outcome if it was also comfortable, breathable, and met the position and rotation requirements necessary to treat DDH. A good splinting material was molded into various splints that were based on conceptual drawings. Trial and error was used to make the best splint. Each splint was fit and tested on a doll before being either rejected or accepted. Eventually, a viable splint was created that fit the doll and met all of the splinting requirements. Testing the splint consisted of placing the splint on the doll and measuring the degree of necessary upward flexion and hip rotation, a procedure which was repeated for the Pavlik Harness. The timing of placement and removal of the splint was also compared. According to the data, the new splint proved to be faster and easier to use. The Subluxation Splint can now, perhaps, undergo patient testing and may one day prove to be a superior alternative to treat DDH.

CHLOROPLAST GENETIC ENGINEERING: A NOVEL METHOD TO PRODUCE HUMAN THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
Shiv M Gaglani
West Shore High School, Melbourne, Florida USA

Due to rapidly escalating costs of pharmaceuticals and the prospective need for mass-producing vaccines, we need to examine how these medicinal compounds can be produced more economically and in greater quantity. Bacterial expression systems lack the molecular machinery to efficiently produce therapeutic proteins. Chloroplast genetic engineering is an alternative approach to express these proteins. This system offers several unique advantages over other expression methods, including cost-effectiveness, potential for oral delivery, and genetic safety.<br><br> In this study, genes encoding for therapeutic proteins, such as apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and human serum albumin (HSA), were inserted into the pLD chloroplast transformation vector. The vector contained a psbA 5'UTR upstream sequence to enhance protein expression as well as the aadA gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic spectinomycin. Each vector was bombarded into the abaxial side of leaves of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), which were cultured on media with spectinomycin to select only the successfully transformed shoots. These shoots were allowed to develop into transgenic plants. Electrophoresis, Northern/Southern/Western blotting, immunolabelling, and ELISA analysis confirmed that HSA, among other proteins, was successfully expressed in the chloroplasts of the transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco transformed with the vector containing the psbA 5'UTR region expressed HSA at 7.2% total protein and reached up to 11% tp with 50 hours continuous light exposure. ApoA1 expression results are pending.<br><br> In summary, chloroplast genetic engineering appears to be a feasible method that has potential to produce biopharmaceuticals more efficiently and provide them to those who need them most.<br><br>

STEVIA INDUCTION OF DNA REPAIR MECHANISMS: A STUDY OF INDUCED DNA DAMAGE AND GENETIC EXPRESSION
Kaleb Markus Naegeli
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, United States 

The purpose was to study mechanisms through which stevia may modify expression of PCNA and DNA repair genes p53 and p21 and alter DNA repair mechanisms for ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide DNA damage in human fibroblasts. Stevia was tested at 2500, 5000, 10000µg/mL (St2500, St5000, St10000). For DNA repair, cells were damaged with 10, 15, or 20mJ UV irradiation or 5, 10, or 15µM hydrogen peroxide. For gene expression, cells were treated for twenty-four hours and immunoblotted. Tukey-Kramer statistical analysis tested the data for significance. St5000 yielded a statistically significant increase in cell growth when no mutations were induced. St10000 increased p53 expression while suppressing expression of p21; this concentration also increased cell survival rates in both 15 and 20mJ UV-irradiation tests by 40%. The other two stevia concentrations had no significant effect upon UV survival rates. St10000 at 10µM hydrogen peroxide and St2500 at 10 and 15µM hydrogen peroxide decreased survival rates 29, 56%, and 40% respectively. All stevia concentrations increased cell survival at 5µM hydrogen peroxide. St5000 greatly suppressed p53 expression and maintained p21 expression. Higher stevia concentrations induced DNA repair and also increased expression of p53 while suppressing p21. Enhancement of p53 at higher stevia concentrations and p21 expression maintained at lower stevia concentrations shows an inverse relationship between the two genes following stevia treatment. Stevia holds the ability to repair DNA mutations while perhaps increasing susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide damage. These results demonstrate that the sugar substitute stevia holds promise as an anti-cancer agent.

MERCURY RELEASE FROM PALLADIUM-CONTAINING AMALGAM AFTER BLEACH EXPOSURE
Emma Caroline Jeffries
Columbia River High School, Vancouver, Washington, USA

Inorganic mercury, though not as potent as organic mercury, is still toxic in large doses, and is released from dental amalgam, though in relatively small amounts. This experiment compares mercury vapor release from high-copper amalgam with and without palladium when exposed to bleach. The researcher hypothesized as bleach concentration increased, so would mercury release, and samples with Pd would release less mercury than samples without Pd. Forty samples each with and without Pd were separated into five different groups, one control and four different concentrations of bleaches. After 7 hours of bleaching, the amalgams were sanded and mercury release was measured with a gold film mercury analyzer. T-tests performed between each group within the Pd and non-Pd groups, and then between the Pd and non-Pd groups indicated that both control groups released significantly higher levels of mercury than the bleached containing samples, and both Pd and non-Pd groups exposed to higher concentrations of bleach tended to release less mercury per sample. No conclusion could be drawn about the effects of the presence of Pd. These results contradict all previous literature.

THE BIOACTIVITY OF TRICLOSAN
Drew F. Chesanek
Bradenton Preparatory Academy, Bradenton, FL, USA

Triclosan is a substance that is present in many deodorants, soaps, and toothpaste because of its antibacterial properties. However, when triclosan comes in contact with chlorinated water it is found to produce chloroform, which may exceed EPA standard limits making it a serious health hazard. My interest to study this substance was sparked after watching a news program about triclosan. The purpose of my experiment is to block the phenol of triclosan by acetylating in order to see if triclosan acetate has antibacterial properties like the parent, triclosan. My hypothesis was I would be able to synthesize triclosan acetate and it would be ineffective as an antibacterial compound.<br><br>I synthesized triclosan acetate by reaction of triclosan and acetic anhydride. The acetate was purified by an extractive process and shown to be pure by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, Rf = 0.93; triclosan, Rf = 0.68). I then tested triclosan and triclosan acetate against B.subtilis for anti-bacterial activity and found that triclosan acetate was active, but only 44-49% as effective as triclosan against B. subtilis.<br><br>Triclosan acetate was synthesized and proved to have antibacterial properties. This data allowed me to reject my original hypothesis and conclude that the phenol group is not totally responsible for triclosan’s antibacterial properties. The shape of the molecule and the presence of the chlorine atoms may prove to be more responsible for these properties. Therefore, future studies could include synthesizing and testing different, but similar molecules to triclosan to determine which part(s) of the molecule are responsible for its bioactivity.<br><br>

ENGINEERING OF A NOVEL INHIBITOR OF BIOFILM-ENCAPSULATED PATHOGENS
Madhavi Pulakat Gavini
The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, Mississippi, USA

Pseudomonas infection is a leading cause of death among patients with AIDS, Cystic Fibrosis, cancer and burn victims. These opportunistic pathogens are multidrug resistant. They produce biofilms that protect bacteria from phagocytosis and antibiotics. Therefore, treating Pseudomonas infections requires biofilm inhibitors. The aim of this research is to engineer a method to inhibit the growth of biofilm-forming pathogens. Since non-biofilm forming Pseudomonas is abundant in the environment, the hypothesis is that herbal products would contain biofilm-inhibiting compounds. First, an abiotic technique was developed to isolate a biofilm-forming Pseudomonas from the non-biofilm forming lab-stock of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01. The resulting clonal isolate designated Pseudomonas aeruginosa MG1could produce biofilm. Gram staining, growth on Pseudomonas isolation agar plates, Oxidase and Catalase tests, light microscopy, and global gene expression profiling by Microarray technique showed MG1 is a model for biofilm forming Pseudomonas. Effects of ten herbal extracts/compounds on the growth of PA01 and MG1 were tested by spot testing and growth curve analysis. Terminalia chebula (Tc) extract was the most potent inhibitor of both Pseudomonas strains and was able to inhibit their growth even after over 100 fold dilution. Microarray and Real-time PCR techniques showed that Tc can reduce or inhibit expression of genes needed for establishing biofilm and infection in animal host. The anti-microbial compound in Tc is water soluble, functional after autoclaving and at pH 7.0, and has a size <0.1 micron. It is ideal for developing anti-microbial sprays and inhalers to treat Pseudomonas infections.

QUERCETIN AND IRON AS POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS FOR GDNF PRODUCTION TO REDUCE PARKINSON’S
Amy Kathleen Feller
Greybull High School, Greybull, Wyoming, USA

Parkinson’s disease plagues four million people world-wide today. By the year 2040, that four million is expected to double. At this time there is no known preventative procedure or medicine to cure Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is a neurological disorder that causes the body’s muscles to seize, and impairs movement. This project experimented with a rat neurological cell line (PC-12) to find a means to produce more Glial Cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) in brain tissue. GDNF is a protein that aides in neurological cell growth and survival. Two different antioxidants were evaluated for their abilities to increase the expression of GDNF. The first antioxidant was quercetin, found in blueberry extracts. The second antioxidant was iron, supplied through a raspberry extract. PC-12 cells from ATCC were treated with NGF and grown in a culture incubator to stimulate formation of nerve cell phenotypes. Healthy mature cells were placed into slides containing four wells. There were three slides of cells tested with blueberry extract and three slides of raspberry extract. The control was represented by two slides that were not treated. The cells were allowed to grow in the slide wells, then were stained and viewed. The expression of GDNF was determined using computer density image analysis. The outcomes showed that blueberry enhanced cells had the largest average with a 215.42 expression rate for GDNF. Those cells treated with the raspberry extract gave an average expression of 168.23 counts. Control slides produced an expression average of 129.45 counts. Results suggest that blueberry extracts, which contain quercetin, increase the expression of GDNF in PC-12 cells by nearly double over control values. <br><br><br>

EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN REGULATION ON THE CCR5 CO-RECEPTOR IN THE UTERUS
Alison Lea Siler
Garinger High School, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States

Estrogen is a female hormone produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands. Estrogen regulates proliferation and differentiation through changes in gene expression in the mammalian uterus. Studies have shown that estrogen is known to increase regulation of the CCR5 expression in the cells. CCR5 is located on the epithelial cells in the uterus. The variant CCR5, CC-chemokine, may inhibit the HIV-1 replication. HIV attaches to the CD4+ cells in the body and then bonds to the CCR5 co-receptor to initiate infection. Without the CCR5 co-recptor, HIV can not enter the cell. It was hypothesized that estrogen would up-regulate expression of the CCR5 co-recptor in the uterus. To test the hypothesis, the mice were ovarectomized, to remove endogenous hormones. They were treated for 4 days with progesterone (2mg/day) and on the last day, they received a single injection of estrogen (1ng). The uterus was isolated at 0 hour and 1 hour after estrogen injections. RNA was isolated from the uterus and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA was used for PCR amplification of CCR5. The data supports the hypothesis. This would indicate that women are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection through the uterus during the follicular phase of the cycle.

THE EFFECTS OF RESVERATROL ON CELL INVASION AND EXPRESSION OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE-2 (MMP-2) IN ER- AND ER+ BREAST CANCER CELLS IN VITRO
Pamela Eunice Palmer
Hall High School, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America

Abstract<br><br>Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide. Breast cancer, as any other cancer, is more destructive and has a poor prognosis due to the spread of the disease. The destruction of surrounding connective tissue by cancer cells contribute to its aggressive behavior. A number of studies have shown that up-regulation of a family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. Degradation of the matrix is thought to contribute to tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In the current study, the student researcher studied the effect of resveratrol on invasion potential of two breast cancer cell lines. The student researcher tested the effect of resveratrol on estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 and estrogen-receptor negative (ER-) MB-231 breast cancer cells. Invasion and metastatic properties were measured using an in vitro Matrigel cellular invasion assay and the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). The student researcher has shown in previous studies that MCF-7 and MB-231 cells respond differently to resveratrol and further that MB-231 cells had a higher level of STAT3, which is a transcription factor known to be activated in a number of tumors and can turn on other genes involved in the cancer process. Recent studies have shown that breast cancer with elevated STAT3 is correlated with more invasive cancers.<br><br>

COPPER(II)2(3,5-DIISOPROPYLSALICYLATE)4-INDUCED REDIFFERENTIATION OF PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS
Mehak Gupta 
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR, United States 

The purpose of my research was to determine whether copper(II)2(3,5-diisopropylsalicylate)4 [Cu(II)2(3,5-DIPS)4] treated pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells would redifferentiate to normal cells as evidenced by a reduction in cell number without cell killing. Cell number and viability were determined using a Coulter Particle Counter in conjunction with the Trypan Blue exclusion and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-4-sulfophenyl-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) derived formazan assays. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were treated with DMEM media containing 0, 25, 50, or 100 microMolar Cu(II)2(3,5-DIPS)4. Cell counts of well-wall (viable) attached cells and non-attached (non-viable) cells in media were performed every 24 hours after initial treatment. The Trypan Blue dye exclusion assay, performed with a hemocytometer, and the MTS assay, performed with a ultraviolet-visible absorption measuring Safire Microplate Reader were used to measure metabolically active cells in order to determine cell viability. There was no decrease in cell viability found by examining the culture media for evidence of dead cells as measured by the Trypan Blue staining assay and the MTS derived formazan assay, providing no evidence of cell killing. These experiments, therefore, establish that Cu(II)2(3,5-DIPS)4 has the potential to be used as a clinical drug to treat cancers without cell killing in contrast with traditional treatment methods that require cancer cell killing.

SELF-FOLDING DEVICES FOR TRANSMUCOSAL DRUG DELIVERY- PART II
Andrew Lee
Upper Arlington High School, Columbus, Ohio, United States

Oral drug administration faces problems, such as stomach acidity, enzyme degradation, and short residence time in the intestine. The purpose of this project is to design self-regulated delivery devices based on self-folding hydrogels. The self-folding bilayer consists of a swelling poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) layer and a non-swelling poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) layer. The model drug is entrapped in a mucoadhesive Carbopol layer attached to the bilayer. Enhanced binding and improved drug release of this self-folding patch has been successfully demonstrated in last year’s study using a food dye as the model drug and pig small intestine as the delivery site. <br><br> A systematic experimental study was carried out this year to develop a comprehensive delivery device, to better understand the dynamics of the bonding and de-bonding process of the patch, and to measure protein based drug release. A thin and non-adhesive PHEMA layer was added on top of the bilayer and patches were placed in enteric capsules. The folding and de-bonding behavior was visualized with a microscope in a flow device. A two-sided diffusion cell with a pig intestine mucous membrane was used for the drug release test with both food dye and Bovine Serum Albumen (BSA) as model drugs. The results showed that drug on self-folding hydrogels can be protected from stomach acid by using enteric capsules and the thin PHEMA layer can prevent the patch from adhering to the intestine on the wrong side. The device with self-folding bilayer enhanced the delivery of the drug and the data was repeatable. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF MPP+ ON GENE EXPRESSION AND DOPAMINE IN PC-12 CELLS: AN IN-VITRO MODEL OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Heather Kay Ali
Fayetteville High School, Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States of America

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly and is associated with a reduction in the neurotransmitter, dopamine (DA). PD occurs when DA-producing neurons in the substantia nigra begin to die or become impaired. In this project a cell model of PD was examined for alterations in both neurotransmitter concentration and gene expression to determine if these changes are similar to those observed in PD. PC-12 cells have similar neurochemical properties to actual dopaminergic brain cells. PC-12 cells in culture were exposed to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). They were dosed with 500 micromolars of MPP+, incubated for four, eight, and twenty-four hours, then harvested, and examined for: 1) Neurotransmitter content 2) RNA (ribonucleic acid) quantity and quality, 3) Gene expression, and 4) Cell staining to observe changes in cell structure. MPP+ treatment of PC-12 cells decreased the amount of DA and its metabolites DOPAC (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid) and HVA (homovanillic acid) in a time dependent manner. There was also a decrease in the total amount of RNA as the exposure time for MPP+ increased. Significant gene expression changes were also produced by as evidenced by alterations in both Alpha-Synuclein and DAT (dopamine transporter) genes. Fluorescent microscopy showed an increase in nuclear fragmentation and condensation. This data indicates that MPP+ produces a neurotoxic effect in PC-12 cells similar to the effects shown in Parkinson’s disease making it an excellent in-vitro model.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF MAXILLARY CENTRAL INCISORS & NAIL PLATES TO DETERMINE A CORRELATION
Robin B. Jones
Brunswick High School, Brunswick, GA, USA

You're playing ball with your son and he accidentally hits you in your mouth knocking out your front teeth or maxillary central incisors. Is there a simple way besides estimation and examining the other teeth to get the correct measurement of the teeth? In this experiment one will determine how by the process of comparing and contrasting the maxillary central incisors and the nail plates. The purpose is to find an easier way to replace your front teeth when they fall out because of old age or are knocked out by accident. It was hypothesized that the maxillary central incisors will correlate with the nail plate using the statistical analysis and is consistently accurate (75%of the time).<br><br> The procedures were as followed: measure of the nail plate on the middle finger with a caliper. Then measure the maxillary central incisors with a caliper. Record results and compare and contrast measurements. The results were that out of all the 21 participants, participants #4 and #'s 17-21 had the same maxillary central incisors as their nail plates. The rest of the participants were 3 millimeters at the most and at the least, 0.5mm.<br><br> The conclusion did not support the hypothesis because only six of the twenty-one participants had the same size maxillary central incisors and nail plates. The results determined that there was a correlation though it wasn't apparent in looking at the results and their differences. The procedures used here would not be accurate to use in patients who have missing maxillary central incisors.

ABSTRACT ALLICIN VS. CHAP: SYNERGISTIC/DETRIMENTAL
Juman Ziad Khweis
Taos High School, Taos, New Mexico, USA

Research indicates that garlic can prevent cancer and lower cholesterol, but does its most potent component (Allicin) have a bactericidal effect when tested on E. coli Strain K 12?<br><br> This led to the question, “Will Allicin affect bacterial growth when it reacts with HCl and the enzymes Chy-Max, Amylase, and Pepsin?” It is hypothesized: (1) Allicin will have the best bactericidal effect than any other enzyme or HCl (2) Allicin will exhibit a synergistic bactericidal effect when in combination with HCl, Amylase, Chy-Max, and Pepsin. <br><br> To perform this experiment, fill sterile test tubes with 10 mL of nutrient broth, 0.1 mL of E. coli and .01 g of a different chemical (Chy-Max, HCl, Amylase, Pepsin). Allow solutions to set for 15 minutes at 22 degrees C. Plate 0.1 mL of each inoculated solution on nutrient agar. Incubate plates for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Repeat the same procedure for all Allicin/enzyme, Allicin/HCl, enzyme/enzyme, and HCl/enzyme solutions.<br><br> The results indicate that Pepsin/Chy-Max had the best bactericidal activity. Amylase/Chy-Max exhibited the least bactericidal activity. Although Amylase/Chy-Max killed very little bacteria in comparison to Pepsin/Chy-Max, it did have some bactericidal properties when compared to the baseline of E. coli in nutrient broth. It is evident that Pepsin by itself and in combination with other enzymes, HCl and Allicin exhibited the highest level of bactericidal activity.<br><br> Upon data collection and interpretation, it was concluded that the Allicin exhibited a high level of bactericidal activity when compared singly, but not as high as Pepsin. In chemical combinations, it was concluded that all Pepsin combinations rated at a high level of synergistic bactericidal activity. <br><br>

A HUMAN PULSE ANALYSIS SYSTEM BASED ON VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Liang Zhao
No.2 High School of East China Normal University, Shanghai, China

Pulse diagnosis is one of the four diagnostic techniques in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has been widely practiced in China for more than 2600 years. <br><br>In this project, a pulse analysis system was developed based on the combination of pulse diagnosis and two advanced techniques, virtual instruments and artificial intelligence. Human radial artery pulse signals were detected with a mechanic (strain-gauge or PVDF) sensor connected to a computer. Data acquisition and analyses were integrated on the virtual instrument platform, LabVIEW. Using time and frequency domain analyses, a series of parameters reflecting human pulse features were figured out. With these parameters, three kinds of artificial neural networks (ANN) were created using Matlab to recognize pulse conditions. <br><br>Using this system, an experiment on abdominal respiration was conducted and its influence on the pulse condition was described. An example of neural network recognition was established by studying pregnancy pulse which is a unique category in traditional Chinese pulse diagnosis. Pulse data of 109 women (including both pregnant and non-pregnant) were recorded, analyzed and compared. The data were divided into training set and test set to train ANNs. Test results showed: the recognition accuracy of the three methods (BP, RBF and support vector machine) reached 90.48%, 85.71% and 88.10% respectively.<br><br>The contributions of this project are threefold. Firstly, an effective system was developed to study pulse conditions. Secondly, artificial intelligent identification of pregnancy pulse was explored. Thirdly, the results supported the TCM theories and also provided a new vision of non-invasive health examination. <br><br>

BLEACHING OUT BACTERIA: A STUDY ON THE USE OF CLOROX ® REGULAR-BLEACH AS A CLEANING AGENT IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SETTING
Katherine Anne Horton
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL, USA. 

The purpose of this project was to study the effects of Clorox ® Regular-Bleach when used as a sanitizer in an elementary school environment. The hypothesis was that the overall number of absences recorded during the experiment would decrease by 20% after using Clorox ® Regular-Bleach as a sanitizer. <br><br> For three weeks, each desk in three elementary school classrooms—first, second, and third grade classes—was cleansed with a fresh paper towel and undiluted Clorox ® once a day. The number of absences during each week was recorded and compared to the number of absences during the same week of last year. Six random bacterial samples were take from each classroom every week to see if the Clorox ® was killing the bacteria on the desks. The results were recorded. <br><br> The project compared the three classrooms in three ways. First, each child’s absentee record during the time that the experiment was conducted this year (November 28th-December 16th, 2005) was compared to their absentee record from the same dates of yesteryear (November 28th-December 16th, 2004). Second, the overall numbers of absences in each classroom were compared to the number of absences from the other classrooms. Third, the bacterial samples from each classroom were compared to one another. It was found that after using Clorox ® as a sanitizer the overall number of absences from the 52 subjects was decreased by 37.5%, exceeding the hypothesis and proving that Clorox ® Regular-Bleach can be used to reduce absences in an elementary school environment. <br><br>

Landesgymnasium St. Afra, Meissen, Germany

The objective of my research was to develop a novel prophylaxis of catheter associated UTI and to study it in vitro. I decided to develop a local prophylactic system based on impregnating the surface of the catheter itself with antibiotics, and to study the kinetics of consequent release of the drug.<br><br>Results: The combination of a hydrogel as carrier substance and Norfloxacin as antibiotic demonstrated close to optimal release properties, characterized by:<br><br>– High initial release – "initial burst" – a high and effective concentration of the antibiotic at the locus of infection from the very start of therapy<br><br>– A continual increase over the following 24 hours to provide a thoroughly effective concentration<br><br>– Close to linear dependency of the local concentration of antibiotic on the incubation concentration during system production, resulting in predictable and controllable release parameters<br><br>– Satisfaction of important criteria for minimizing the risk of development of resistance t<br><br>Overall, local prophylaxis using the proposed system has the following advantages over traditional oral administration of antibiotics:<br><br>– No damage to the patient's natural bacterial flora beyond the locus of infection<br><br>– Reduction of systemic side-effects due to minimal resorption of the antibiotic into the bloodstream<br><br>– Reduced adhesion of bacteria to the surface of the catheter <br><br>– Prevention of biofilm development<br><br>In particular, as a consequence of the last two points, the use of the proposed system can be considered to result in a significant reduction of hospital-acquired catheter associated UTI.

CLASSIFICATION OF CELL CULTURE AND PRE-MALIGNANT TISSUE BASED ON RADIAL-LBF ANALYSIS OF NUMA IN THE MAMMARY EPITHELIUM
Eugenia Gabrielova
West Lafayette Junior/Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN, United States

NuMA, a nuclear protein found in the mammary epithelium, is sensitive to changes in cell and tissue phenotypes. NuMA distribution has been studied by manually measuring foci, but this method is inadequate when NuMA is spatially reorganized as observed during cell differentiation. Basement membrane images of normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells can be classified to accurately reflect in vivo behavior after differentiation. Radial local bright feature (radial-LBF) analysis has been developed to correct the inadequacies of manual protein analysis. Local brightness in images of fluorescently-immunolabeled NuMA has been studied using Radial-LBF analysis and is measured based on an average nuclear brightness. Thousands of nuclear LBF were quantified with the help of confocal imaging technology to discover changes in nucleic organization throughout cancer progression. This three-dimensionally based automated classification system measured distributional changes of NuMA in pre-malignant tissue with clarity that has not yet been established with manual analysis methods. Sub-populations of cells were introduced into cell culture of different stages and studied using the three-dimensional classification method described above. First, cell populations were voluntarily mixed and distinguished with pre-malignant tissue samples. Second, heterogeneous populations with multiple phenotypes were classified to recognize changes in cell aggressiveness within mammary epithelial tissue. The growth pattern of these populations was identified from basement membrane culture imagery. Various structural brightness parameters were also digitally analyzed. Sub-classes were identified for the purpose of advancing clinical cancer diagnosis methodology.

NANOTECHNOLOGY: PHASE II, DEVELOPMENT OF A NANOPARTICLE-BASED SENSOR TO DETECT A CANCER BIOMARKER
Gina Elisabeth Paietta
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH, USA

The use of nanoparticles provides a new and versatile set of building blocks to construct novel types of biosensors to examine molecular processes, biological fluids, cells and tissues. The project goal was to develop a nanoparticle-based biosensor to be used for the detection of a cancer biomarker. In particular, the approach taken was to harness the quenching of quantum dot fluorescence by gold nanoparticles, using a DNA-assembled nanostructure, for the detection of collagenase activity. Collagenases represent one category of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP’s) that are produced by cancer cells and are associated with metastatic potential. The successful function of the biosensor was demonstrated by a significant change in fluorescent signal observed when the quantum dot-gold nanoparticle biosensor (containing a peptide as a biological recognition element) was exposed to collagenase activity. The quenching of fluorescent emission upon detection of collagenase by the sensor was both substantial (an 85% reduction) and reproducible. Key parameters examined included the length of the oligonucleotide that was used to direct the self-assembly of the sensor (20 nucleotides was optimal), as well as assay incubation time (60 minutes was optimal). Control experiments using a competitor oligonucleotide confirmed that the biosensor was functioning according to design by reversal of the quenching effect. The design of the sensor is flexible in that by simply changing the peptide used in the biosensor, then a different cancer-related protease could be detected. The nanobiosensing approach reported here may eventually lead to better survival rates by improving the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of cancer.

NON-INVASIVE BIOSENSORS FOR THE DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CROHN'S DISEASE
Stephanie Maria Bachas-Daunert
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington KY, USA

Crohn’s disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of the entire digestive tract. Although the aetiology is not completely understood, the pathogenesis of CD is believed to be due to bacterial infection. Certain bacteria produce and respond to the extracellular signaling molecules N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), known as quorum sensing molecules (QSMs). Bacteria communicate with each other by releasing and responding to QSMs, whose concentration is a function of cell population density. Expression of genes responsible for pathogenicity occurs when a critical concentration of these QSMs is reached. This phenomenon is termed as quorum sensing because the concentration of the QSMs is a reflection of the population size. Bacterial QSMs can be recognized by mammalian cells, and, thus, induce the on-set of inflammation. Currently, there is no simple, fast, non- or minimally invasive method for the diagnosis and management of CD. To that end, we developed a biosensor for QSMs and employed it in the detection of these molecules in saliva of healthy volunteers as well as of CD patients. The biosensor is based on genetically engineered cells capable of emitting bioluminescence in the presence of QSMs. This method provides a non-invasive diagnostic tool with potential use as a home self-test for detection of CD onset and its management, through early identification of a “flare-up”. Finally, detection of QSMs in gastrointestinal samples by our biosensor may help in gaining insight and understanding of the interplay between gastrointestinal bacterial flora and inflammatory bowel diseases.

LAUGHTER: THE BEST MEDICINE? EFFECTS OF LAUGHTER ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN COMPARISON TO EXERCISE
Kendra Malia Ho Ching
Kahuku High School, Kahuku, HI, USA

<br><br> Diabetes has become a dynamic concern for thousands of Americans. The disease, which obstructs the body’s ability to utilize glucose in the blood and results in dangerously high blood glucose levels, affects 20.8 million Americans. Researchers are constantly looking for ways to reduce glucose levels in order to combat the disease. Muscular activity decreases glucose levels because it requires energy. The body obtains energy from blood glucose. When people exercise, they use more of the glucose in their blood. My project studies the effects of laughter on blood glucose in comparison to the effects of exercise. <br><br> I tested ten subjects; five diabetic, five non-diabetic. Their glucose levels were monitored during three sessions; day 1) after they viewed a humorous film, day 2) after they watched a boring documentary, day 3) after 20 minutes of exercise.<br><br> The glucose levels of four of the five diabetic subjects decreased after they watched the humorous film. The blood glucose levels of all the subject’s except 1dropped significantly after 20 minutes of exercise. <br><br> Laughter did lower glucose levels in most of the participants. This was more relevant in the diabetic subjects whose initial glucose levels were very high. Increased muscular activity in the abdomen, as well as the release of endorphins (caused by laughter) most likely contributed to the decrease. Exercise undoubtedly reduces glucose levels by astonishing degrees. The commercial recommendation to exercise for improved health is no lie. To help reduce glucose levels, diabetics should take the time each day to exercise and LAUGH! <br><br>

MOLECULAR BASIS OF ANOXIA STRESS SURVIVAL
Desh Prakash Mohan
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX, USA

Anoxia is a condition of oxidative stress in which there is absolutely no oxygen in the environment. This condition underlies the pathogenesis of several diseases including cardiac, pulmonary, and cerebral dysfunction, and cancerous cells in oxygen-deprived tumors. To better understand this response, we are studying the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode. In this study, I examined if (1) gender influences the anoxic stress response in C. elegans, and (2) what gender-specific pathways, genes, or molecules may be involved in this response.<br><br> <br><br> I found that gender indeed affects the stress response of the C. elegans nematodes to anoxia—males survived anoxic stress much better than their hermaphrodite counterparts did. So far, in the search for molecules influencing anoxia, a small heat shock protein, hsp-12.6, and a glycolytic enzyme, gpd-2, were confirmed to be key factors in anoxia survival. Since males and hermaphrodites differ in a single X-chromosome, elucidation of potential X-chromosome genes that may impact the anoxia responses emerges as an important future direction of my work. Undoubtedly, unraveling the molecular blueprints for anoxia survival holds the key to how we manage a wide spectrum of human diseases marked by anoxia. <br><br>

CELL SURVIVAL, GENOMIC INSTABILITY, AND BYSTANDER EFFECTS INDUCED BY IONIZING RADIATION
Danna Elisabeth Thomas
Broadneck Senior High School, Annapolis, Maryland, United States

Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell-Human Chromosome-4 (CHOC4) cells were used to test hypotheses that; 1) cellular irradiation induces delayed genomic instability 2) microbeam irradiation induces bystander effects (BE) in neighboring unirradiated cells. Genomic instability is defined as increased acquisition of genomic alterations in progeny of irradiated cells generations after exposure. Microbeam radiation mimics X-rays, but permits focused exposures of defined cell subpopulations within larger populations. <br><br>CHOC4 cell X-ray sensitivity was characterized by measuring cell survival and used to select 5 Gy microbeam radiation dose for the study. To test hypotheses for delayed chromosomal rearrangements experimental groups were generated in which 0% (control), 10% or 100% of progenitor cells were irradiated.<br><br>Analyses of metaphase chromosomes indicated no significant increase in chromosomal aberrations 10 days postirradiation for either group relative to controls. An increase in chromosome 4 kick-outs, however, was indicative of chromosomal instability. Similar incidence of kickouts between the 10% and 100% groups indicates BE-induced genomic instability. Absence of BE would have manifested as a reduced number of kickouts in 10% group relative to the 100% group. <br><br>These results support hypotheses for radiation-induced delayed instability and BE. The classic radiation biology paradigm is that radiation energy must be deposited in cell nucleus to elicit biological effects. However, this study demonstrates that the target for radiation-induced effects is not solely the irradiated cell, but also includes surrounding cells. The implications of non-targeted delayed effects of radiation exposure must be evaluated to determine significance of these indirect effects on human health and carcinogenic potential.<br><br>

TREATMENT OF AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: 2ND YEAR STUDY. EFFECT OF INTRAOCULAR STEROID ON CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULATURE AND VITREAL VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR LEVEL
Sabrina Lakshmi Prabakaran
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in Americans over the age of 60. AMD is caused by Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV). CNV is the development of abnormal leaky blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. <br><br> The purpose of my experiment is to determine the effect of intra-ocular steroid Triamcinolone Acetonide (TAAC) on CNV and its effect on ocular Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels. VEGF is a known promoter of CNV.<br><br> Experiment: The C57BL6 mice were used. The animals were treated per the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The researcher received animal care and use certification by IACUC and was trained in all aspects of the experiment. Student researcher performed all assays and assisted in all aspects of the experiment except euthanasia. Five experimental and five control animals received a laser application to the left eye to induce experimental CNV. Control animals received an intra-ocular injection of saline to the lasered eye and experimental animals receive TAAC (manipulated variable). The animals were euthanized two weeks after the injections. The vitreous was assayed by ELISA for VEGF levels. The choroid was stained with Rhodamine-Agglutinin for CNV and examined using Zeiss and confocal microscopy. <br><br> Results showed that TAAC significantly reduced experimental CNV compared to saline (p=.05). VEGF levels in the vitreous were significantly lower in the TAAC group suggesting TAAC’s reduction of CNV through suppression of VEGF. <br><br> Conclusion: With the 'Ageing of America' Macular degeneration is about to hit 'epidemic proportions'. It is a disabling illness where the elderly victims lose their vision, independence and dignity. Treatment options for AMD are limited. This study shows TAAC to be a promising treatment option.<br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF THE CONSUMPTION OF B12 AND B9 VITAMIN AND ZINC SUPPLEMENTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS LIFE QUALITY
Alana Rocha Schmidt Witt
Fundação Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha - Novo Hamburgo - RS - Brasil

As a person gets older, needs of body energy decrease, on the other hand needs of some nutrients become higher. Right nutrition is required for physical, mental and social hear for every human being.<br><br> The goal of this research is to verify the mainly nutritional lacks in senior citizens, proposing a way to adequate the ingestion in an efficient way. It was found out that the most common nutritional lacks among the seniors are of B12(cianocobalamina) and B9(folic acid)and Zinc. As a consequence of these nutritional lacks, absence of energy to carry out the daily activities can be mentioned. Due to law nutrient absorption from the daily diet, the best way to replace the nutrients for seniors is supplements. We can mention folic acid: the human body can absorb 50% of folic acid in food, 85% in fortified food and 100% in supplements.<br><br> Based on this information, seniors from a public asylum took a daily supplement containing the nutrients mentioned before, according to doctor’s recommendations, during twelve months. During the nutritional intervention, health tests were done to identify any alteration. At the beginning of the research, memory tests were done as well as in the end of the period. The memory tests, showed an increase of 77% in the tested people’s attention. <br><br> A better quality of sleeping and more energy for daily activities were shown after the third month of intervention. The death rate in the asylum during this year decreased in 75%. At the end of the intervention period, the tests also showed that the ingestion of the nutrients before mentioned generated benefits for the mental and physical heath in seniors and increased life quality.<br><br>

MAM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS
Fei Chen
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton, OR USA

The aim of my study was to examine the DNA methylating agent Methylazoxymethanol on the functional development of neonatal cerebellar granule cells. The goal was to establish a clear link between persistent DNA damage and prolonged detrimental cell injury. The approach for examining this relationship is relatively novel; there have been no studies that focused on functional damage in cell cultures. Therefore I wanted to look at how MAM affected axon elongation in wild type cells and then look at its effect on DNA repair mutants to establish a relationship between persistent DNA damage and functional damage to cells in development. Neuronal cells that have already been exposed to varying concentrations of MAM for various time periods are cultured and then fixed at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining is then applied to these cells, staining for the primary antibody B-tubulin and labeled with the green fluorescent dye-Alexa 488. Pictures were taken of these cells and morphometric analysis was done on these pictures measuring the axon elongation lengths at different time points and exposure levels. Analysis of my data shows that short exposures at high concentration levels do not kill the cells, but instead causes very significant disruption to axon elongation. More importantly MAM was significantly more detrimental to DNA repair mutant neurons, suggesting a link between DNA and the functional deficits seen. This data furthers the understanding of the mechanisms behind MAM induced damage and most importantly the mechanisms behind environmental damage and the onset of neurodevelopmental disease.

A NOVEL FUNCTION OF LACTATE TRANSPORTER MCT1 IN GASTRIC RESTITUTION
Lisa Madeleine Marrone
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA USA

In this experiment, the function of monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was investigated in restitution of gastric surface mucous cells. Restitution is the repair mechanism by which cells migrate to cover an injured area. In the gastric mucosa, restitution is required both in daily life and in disease to prevent acidic gastric fluids from causing tissue damage and ulceration. Cell migration after gastric injury is dependent upon glycolysis, which under some conditions yields the waste product lactate. The bioflavonoid phloretin, a known inhibitor of MCT1, was used to block lactate transport in migrating cells and determine the overall effect of MCT1 on restitution. It was found that inhibition of MCT1 with phloretin significantly and dose-dependently inhibited restitution. Furthermore, under bicarbonate-free conditions that simultaneously inhibit the bicarbonate transporter NBC, there was a complete inhibition of restitution with no effect on viability. These results suggest that MCT1 activity is necessary for maximum rates of restitution, and also that MCT1 functions along with NBC to regulate intracellular pH and provide a mechanism for lactate efflux during cell migration. This newly discovered role of MCT1 and novel model of pH regulation in gastric restitution can potentially extend existing models of migration in other cell types, especially those that migrate by utilizing glycolysis, such as the repair of skin epithelial cells and migration of lymphocytes and cancer cells. In this way, this study in gastric restitution could lead to novel strategies for both facilitating restitution in skin cells after burn injury and inhibiting metastasis of cancer.

MODELING AUDITORY ATTENTION BY IMPLEMENTING IHC MOVEMENT INTO FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY OF THE INNER EAR: A NOVEL APPROACH TO STIMULI SEPARATION
Jonathan Blake Sellon
Staples High School, Westport, CT, United States

There are two theories that describe auditory attention. One theory suggests that the primary auditory cortex controls attention entirely. The other postulates that attention can occur at the cochlear level. The present study demonstrates that cochlear-based auditory attention is possible and designed an algorithm to describe the process by separating stimuli into unique components utilizing properties of auditory attention. Varying frequency stimuli were introduced into a cochlear auditory nerve model. Spikes activated for different frequencies of sound were then examined to determine the best method of separation. Next, a mathematical description of the volumetric movement of the cochlea’s inner hair cells (IHCs) was created. The addition of IHC movement into the original developed model allowed for better stimuli separation.<br><br>There are several implications for the model. First, the model verifies that cochlear-based attention is possible. Second, these results suggest a new way to separate multiple auditory inputs for sound recognition software. One problem in auditory recognition algorithms today is that many fail to separate two stimuli introduced at the same instance. Incorporating the new cochlear model of auditory attention into a device (such as a cochlear implant or speech recognition) would provide a new way for the device to process various input stimuli at the same instant.

A NOVEL NON-INVASIVE METHOD FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA
Jason Bernard Clain
Greenwich High School, Greenwich CT, USA

Malignant melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer related death. Millions of people are at risk for melanoma as a result of activities that involve high levels of sun exposure. Dermatologists biopsy suspicious lesions and send the tissue to a pathology lab for conformation analysis. This procedure is not without complications, the biopsy procedure can leave scars and the dermatopathologist can incorrectly interpret the pathology (a potentially fatal mistake). The purpose of this research was to develop a novel method for the non-invasive diagnosis of malignant melanoma using visible spectroscopy. Lesions on patients were analyzed using an OceanOptics HR-2000 spectrometer with an optical fiber reflectance probe and visible light source. A clear difference was observed in the reflectance spectra when suspicious darker lesions and normal skin were contrasted. The reflectance spectra of both malignant melanoma and atypical moles (dysplastic nevi) were compared. Thirty-nine spectra were analyzed and a characteristic signal at 550 nm was identified for melanoma. Eight-three percent of the non-malignant tissue did not show the reflectance at 550 nm. Reflectance visible spectroscopy appears to provide an early non-invasive indication of malignant melanoma. This simple, cost effective screening process could easily be applied by doctors with limited dermatology background and potentially save thousands of lives every year.

MICRO PATHOLOGY LAB CHIP FOR DETECTING MOLECULAR LESIONS OF GLIOBLASTOMA
Carol Yoon Joo Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, USA

Current techniques for cancer diagnosis are inadequate because they can detect distinguishing morphological patterns, but lack the capability to accurately identify intercellular interactions specifically causing a particular cancer. Generalized diagnoses lead to ineffective therapies and high mortality. The objective of this project was to develop a system capable of detecting and analyzing cancer signaling pathways for specific diagnoses and targeted treatments. <br><br> In order to take a systems biology approach, Glioblastoma, the most lethal form of brain cancer, was utilized to integrate signaling pathway analysis with microfluidics. The device was fabricated by soft-lithography. Antibodies were immobilized onto the channels of the device by surface modification. Transfected and untransfected U87 lysates were labeled with fluorescent probes and passed through the device. Expression levels of EGFRvIII, PTEN, mTOR, p-Akt, and p-S6 from the PI3K pathway of Glioblastoma were analyzed under a fluorescent microscope.<br><br> PTEN was detected and showed to be 19.7 fold greater in intensity than in lysates without PTEN. EGFRvIII was also identified and showed detection efficiency two times greater than the controls. Phosphorylated downstream signaling proteins such as mTOR, Akt, and S6 were efficiently analyzed as well. The results were validated with western blots. <br><br> This newly developed device can efficiently analyze protein interactions from cancer signaling pathways. Proteins such as PTEN, EGFRvIII, p-Akt, p-mTOR, and p-S6 from Glioblastoma were efficiently detected on chip. The Micro Pathology Lab Device will improve cancer diagnostics, accelerate drug clinical trials, and aid in the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicines. <br><br>

SICK FROM NON-STICK? A STUDY DONE WITH POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE AND CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Richelle Rae Fritzler
Merino Jr-Sr High School, Merino, CO, US

In past studies, it has been found that polytetrafluoroethylene, more commonly known as Teflon has been linked to several cases of kids with birth defects and even linked to cancers. Just recently, the EPA has suggested removing Teflon from the market by 2015. The purpose of this research project is to test the effects of polytetrafluoroethylene on the mutations, length, and number of progeny of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Before testing the C. elegans, water samples were obtained. Water was boiled in both a Teflon and non-Teflon pan at two different temperatures. A coated carpet and non-coated carpet were also soaked in water.<br><br>After obtaining the six samples, 7 different plates of C. elegans were prepared. The samples were applied to the appropriate group. For the control, distilled water was applied. After exposure, the C. elegans were transferred to X plates and the eggs were allowed to hatch. The number of progeny and lengths of the C. elegans were recorded. The obtained samples were tested for PFOA level using a mass spectrometer.<br><br>When analyzing the data of the large C. elegans in the first generation, the 500 Teflon group had the longest average at 1.31 mm, and the coated carpet averaged 1.22 mm, while the control was 1.18 mm. In the second generation of progeny, the carpet with coating had the most with 86 per grid while the control had 30, and the 500 Teflon group had 18 per grid. It was concluded that the PTFE caused the C. elegans to produce more progeny than the control, as well as produce larger C. elegans.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF T-REG DEPLETION IN EAE REMISSION
Leslie Wen-Hsien Tse
Detroit Country Day Upper School, Beverly Hills, Michigan, USA

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model that is used to study the regulation and pathology of multiple sclerosis. Development of EAE in SJL.B mice is induced by immunization with the neuroantigen, myelin basic protein (MBP). This induction requires that the mice be pre-treated with anti-CD25 antibodies, indicating that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are involved in the control of disease induction. This project investigated whether CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are also involved in the control of the disease’s spontaneous remitting and relapsing activities. In initial experiments, mice depleted of Treg cells and induced with MBP showed normal remitting-relapsing cycles. It was realized that new Treg cells might have been replenished from the thymus, which accounted for the observed remitting cycle. In subsequent experiments, an adoptive transfer system was used. This was done by injecting disease-causing T cells from MBP-immunized donor mice into naïve recipient mice so as to induce EAE. The donor mice were depleted of Treg cells by anti-CD25 treatment and the recipient mice were depleted of Treg cells by both thymectomy and anti-CD25 treatment a month prior to receiving donor cells. Under these conditions, the absence of Treg cells resulted in the abrogation of disease remission and development of a chronic form of the disease. These results indicate that regulatory T cells control both the maintenance of EAE resistance and disease remission after the initial episode of paralysis.

DETECTING NOVEL SUBMICROSCOPIC CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES IN AUTISM
Maryam Ibrahim Sultan
Townsend Harris HS, Flushing New York, United States of America 

The current experiment was performed to identify putative autism susceptibility genes by detecting sub-microscopic duplications or deletions (microdups/dels) within chromosomes of autistic patients with mental retardation (MR) and dysmorphology. It was hypothesized that a large fraction of these patients will carry microdups/dels at a rate corresponding to the severity of their MR and/or dysmorphology and that disruption of genes within these regions may contribute to the autism phenotype. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) was performed on 20 autistic patients and the results were confirmed by genotyping microsatellite markers. Genotyping was also used to map the borders of the microdup/del revealed by aCGH and putative autism susceptibility genes were identified within this region. A deletion within 4q22.1 was verified and the minimal length of the deletion was demonstrated by genotyping. The human gene SNCA, the alpha-synuclein isoform NACP140, was named as a putative autism susceptibility gene. To date, no studies using aCGH for autistic patients have been reported. Data from this project may have implications for subsidized screening for autism in high-risk patients and pregnant women.

THE ROLE OF THE HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR, APICIDIN, IN THE TREATMENT OF T-CELL LEUKEMIA AND LYMPHOMA
Alma Shi
Townsend Harris High School, Forest Hills, NY, USA

T-cell leukemia and lymphoma are common cancers in both children and adults. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are novel therapeutic agents that have antiproliferative effects against various cancers in-vitro. It was hypothesized that apicidin, an HDACI, will have antiproliferative effects against T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cells. T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells were treated with varying concentrations of apicidin in-vitro for 24 hours to 72 hours. Cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis were done to determine the effect of apicidin on cell growth and cell cycle. When compared with other HDACIs (trichostatin A and butyrate), apicidin was a more potent antiproliferative agent against T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells in-vitro. Apicidin induced G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Using western blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, T-cell leukemia cells were observed to express HDACs 1-11. These results show that in-vitro, apicidin is a potent antiproliferative agent against T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells and this effect is associated with G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Microarray analysis is presently being done to determine genes that are specifically modulated by apicidin in these cells. Apicidin could potentially be used in treating patients with relapsed T-cell leukemia or lymphoma.

MIRACLE CELLS: ACTIVATION OF HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL FACTORS WITH THE MOUSE OCT-4 GENE
Subha Subramanian
Iowa City West High School, Iowa City, IA, 52246

Although embryonic stem cells display plasticity and replenish any specialized cell, they pose much controversy because of their origins. Therefore, I sought a protocol to create a pluripotent stem cell not isolated from a human embryo. I asked myself if a mouse Oct-4 gene would be expressed in a human skin fibroblast and regulate pluripotent embryonic stem cell factors. In my protocol, culturing, sub-culturing, transient transfection, RNA isolation, reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction, and electrophoresis are included. The gels indicated that the mouse Oct-4 gene down-regulates to express Nanog and possibly Sox-2. Thus, adult human skin fibroblast cells can express embryonic genes. This finding suggests that adult human skin fibroblasts have the potential to become specialized cells, such as heart, liver, and lung cells. This will reduce organ transplant rejection – a huge benefit to patients in need of organs.

THE IMPACT OF MULLER CELL REACTIVITY DURING RETINAL DEGENERATION
Sheel Tyle
Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, New York, USA

Age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness in the USA. Muller cell reactivity is one common process in all etiologies for various retinal eye diseases and neuronal loss within the retina. Muller cell reactivity was graded as non-reactive, mildly-reactive, moderately-reactive, and severely-reactive based on the age and the area of the degenerating retina sampled. To test whether the effect is due to a diffusible factor, photoreceptor cells were cultured in conditioned media from various graded Muller cells. These results were statistically not significant. When the impact of cell-to-cell contact was tested, the Young Central Muller Cells (non-reactive) allowed 23.78% photoreceptor cell survival; the Young Peripheral (mildly-reactive) allowed 50.17% survival; the Old Central (moderately-reactive) allowed 3.20% survival; and the Old Peripheral (severely-reactive) allowed 3.9% survival. Statistically, these cell-to-cell results were significant individually against the control using t-tests and as a whole using the ANOVA test at p less than or equal to 0.001. From my investigations, it appears that a diffusible factor from the Muller cells doesn’t play a role in preserving photoreceptor cells during retinal degeneration. However, a cell to cell signaling mechanism does seem involved. The more reactive the Muller cells, the lower the survival of photoreceptor cells in coculture; perhaps due to an increase in the release of cytokines from reactive Muller cells or a decrease in growth factors as Muller cell reactivity increases. New therapies for retinal diseases could come from the fact that Muller cells potentially harm photoreceptor cell survival.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE METAL CONTAMINATION OF DONATED BLOOD TO BE USED IN NEONATAL BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS
Allison Michelle Blatz
Mentor High School; Mentor, Ohio, 44060

It was hypothesized that if very-low birth weight infants are given blood transfusions of donated blood bank blood from the Cleveland area, then the infants will be exposed to and possibly harmed by metal contaminants found in the blood. Infants are undergoing rapid cell division; therefore, they are more susceptible to contaminants. For example, exposure to lead at such an early age can cause damage to the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Also, infants can absorb up to forty percent more lead than adults. The metals tested for were lead, mercury, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, nickel, aluminum and manganese. 100 samples of donated blood were tested for metal contamination using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Although many samples yielded values below the limits of detection, this study showed that blood from the Cleveland area contained significantly more lead, mercury and cadmium than did the national average (as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Therefore, the hypothesis was supported.

CAN LIGHT BE USED TO DETECT BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS? YEAR TWO
Julie Krystine Loza
Kouts High School, Kouts IN, United States

The life of a diabetic is filled with daily blood glucose testing. Many diabetes patients do not take this necessary precaution, due to the pain that the poke of the lancet will inflict. Last year, I was able to develop a device that used a laser to painlessly distinguish between high and low blood glucose levels within a human subject. This year I built a device that reduced variability and increased sensitivity. An analog-to-digital data capture device is used to send values representing light intensity to a custom program for analysis. Data was collected by testing volunteers with my device then with a standard glucometer. My results were then compared to the actual blood sugar levels. Five volunteers' data was further analyzed to explore the device's effectiveness on a per-person basis. Because of the difficulty in getting repeated access to the same test subjects, the statistical significance was impacted by a fairly small sample size for some of the subjects. In spite of this, results for any given subject showed a correlation, and some were statistically significant. To determine if the system can distinguish between normal and high blood sugar levels, the data was broken into two categories – high, and low. The high group was defined as consisting of any value read with an actual blood sugar of 150 mg/dl or greater, and the low group was a complementary number of subjects from the low end of the distribution of values. A t-Test was done to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean of the readings from the two groups. The test showed that a significant (á=0.05) difference can be found between the means of subjects with normal blood sugar, and those with high blood sugar. The research here supports the hypothesis that light can be used to detect blood glucose in a human subject in a non-invasive manner. This is most clearly the case when the system is “calibrated” for a specific individual.

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IN THE RAT NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS
Michelle Andrea Nguyen-McCarty
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany, NY, USA

This study characterizes dopamine (DA) transmission in vitro, particularly differences during mimicked single spike versus burst firing. Continuous amperometry was used to quantify DA release and kinetic of elimination after electrical stimulation in rat brain slices. A stimulating electrode placed at DA axons applied one or ten pulses. A recording carbon fiber electrode was placed at the nucleus accumbens. Bath application of D2 receptor agonist quinpirole decreased DA release from normal in vitro levels both after one pulse and after ten pulses by about 50%. After D2 antagonist eticlopride, amplitude decreased by 30% after one pulse, but with ten pulses of stimulation the tenth pulse amplitude increased by 12%. DA transporter blocker nomifensine increased half life of extracellular DA by over sixfold after one pulse and tenth pulse amplitude by over twelvefold after ten pulses. While nomifensine also increases DA half life in vivo, response to the drug is significantly more dramatic in vitro. Furthermore, this is the first time researchers have been able to mimic burst firing in vitro. Once a strong baseline for DA modulation of neural activity is established, this baseline can be used to examine how the DA system is altered in mental disorders such as schizophrenia.

CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF NICOTINE'S PRO-ANGIOGENESIS ACTIVITY: POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DIFFERENT DISEASE PROCESSES
Sarah S Mousa
Columbia High School, East Greenbush New York, United States of America

The present study examined the mechanisms of nicotine’s effect on angiogenesis and its impact on tumor growth and wound healing. Nicotine demonstrated significant (P <0.01) stimulation of the release of endothelial cell growth factor b-FGF but not VEGF. In a concentration-dependent manner, nicotine induced endothelial cell tube formation. Additionally, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of angiogenesis, nicotine effectively induced the generation of new blood vessels (P <0.01), an effect that is mediated via b-FGF. The pro-angiogenesis effect of nicotine in the CAM model was maximally blocked by either anti-integrin alphav beta3 or inhibitor of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK, ERK 1/2). In the CAM tumor implant model, nicotine doubled (P < 0.01) the growth rate of breast, colon, and lung cancer. In contrast, nicotine effectively promoted wound healing in an in vitro scratch wound healing assay. The data indicated that the pro-angiogenesis effect is mediated via b-FGF and induced through the nicotinic receptor, alphav beta3 integrin, and MAPK. Furthermore micro-array analysis demonstrated significant increase in the expression level (> 2 fold above control) and intensity of alphav beta3 integrin, MAP Kinase (ERK1/2), and other associated integrin and kinases after endothelial cell treatment with 0.1 ug/ml nicotine, which was further confirmed by Real Time PCR. This represents a potential utility in using the topical polymeric form of nicotine or nicotine–like compounds in improving wound healing in diabetic patients, without its potential adverse effect of promoting systemic angiogenesis that might result in accelerated tumor growth or metastasis.

A POX ON YOU? A STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CDC'S RESPONSE PLANS TO A SMALLPOX OUTBREAK
Ian Douglas Cummings
St. Joseph Catholic High School, Ogden, Utah, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to test the Centers for Disease Control’s stated and probable response strategies to the localized outbreak of smallpox. A computer model was used as testing this in the real world would be impossible.<br><br> After creating the computer simulation the procedure was initiated with three hundred simulated people, thirty of whom were carriers of the incubating disease. Varying response strategies were activated and the program was allowed to run for the equivalent of one year. The number of those ill, those who died, the immune population, and the healthy (uninfected) population were all tracked electronically. The responses which were tested included a government imposed lockdown of the population with varying levels of obedience, an immunization program vaccinating 0.6%, 3.3%, and 8.3% of the population each day, quarantining those who exhibited the early states of smallpox, and a quarantine of those who exhibited the later and more recognizable symptoms of smallpox. Two more tests were run, one as a control without any response strategies activated, and one with a quarantine as soon as the rash was exhibited and a vaccination effort.<br><br> Results suggest the most effective strategy was a quarantine at the early symptoms. Lockdown was also very effective, but only so long as absolute obedience was maintained. The most effective plausible strategy was an enforced quarantine of those in the later stages of smallpox coupled with an attempt to vaccinate those who had not been infected.<br><br>

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR OF HIF-1 ALPHA AND THE REDUCTION IN THE PROLIFERATION INDEX.
Andrew Allen Gilbert
Northern Utah Academy for Math Engineering and Science (NUAMES), Roy, UT, USA

The treatments that are currently being sought for cancer are lacking in a very fundamental way, in the sense that the research is going towards cures for only very specific kinds of cancer. This project looks at the aspect of a common string among cancers and works to combat it. It was found that VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) was among every common cancer known to man.<br><br> It is hypothesized that the inhibition of HIF-1 ALPHA, using Ki-67 primary anti-body, would reduce glioma growth and decrease the proliferation index. To test this the measurement of the proliferation index of glioblastoma cells with inhibited HIF-1 ALPHA function was compared to the untreated control tumors.<br><br> The proliferation index is calculated after the immunohistochemical staining of Glioblastoma Multiforme cells with the Ki-67 mAb by using the methods described earlier. “A total of 1000 cells in four randomly selected quadrants of high power fields were counted and the ratio of positive cells over the total number of cells counted was calculated as the proliferation index.”(Jensen 2) The proliferation index was used to score the tumors, as well as compare the tumors with HIF-1 ALPHA deprived environment to those cultures in a standard control, environments.<br><br> The data provides such a significant conclusion, and is so far beyond the margin of error, that these results cannot be disputed. The difference in cellular growth, between the tumors that were cultured in the Ki-67 environment, and those in the control environment was approximately 50% less new cellular growth.<br><br>

COMPREHENSIVE GENETIC STUDY, USING COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS, OF AN AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTION CAUSING AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA IN FAMILY 0815
Garrison Dakota Alger
Pine View High School, St. George, Utah, United States of America

The purpose of my experiment was to identify the genetic locus for Retinitis Pigmentosa on the human genome. With the correct identification of the location of the gene, treatments and preventative measures can be created to help those individuals who have the Retinitis Pigmentosa disease or those who are susceptible to the disease. Throughout the experiments I used a series of computer programs known as the LOD Score programs from the Eccles Institute of Human Genetica at the University of Utah. The LOD Score programs are simple statistical analysis programs. I hypothesized that by using the LOD Score programs I would be able to identify the genetic locus for Retinitis Pigmentosa. <br><br>My procedures followed a specific five step method: 1) Set up the computer programs with a data table created with the information of family 0815, 2) Receive data from the lab, 3) Transcribe data into comparable numbers, 4) Run data through the three LOD Score programs, 5) Collect and analyze data. After analyzing the data from the first two data sets I concluded my hypothesis was a null hypothesis and that further data testing is needed to identify the locus of the gene; however, almost three hundred locations where the gene is not located were found. To identify the gene locus continued testing and analysis must be done using more data sets. <br><br>

THE ROLE OF HEME OXYGENASE 2 IN CISPLATIN RESISTANCE IN C13 SEROUS EPTITHELIAL OVARIAN TUMOR CELLS
Vivek Kumar
Suncoast High School, Rivera Florida, United States

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women in the United States. Ovarian cancer is treated with a heavy metal drug called Cisplatin. Several people treated with this drug develop a resistance to it. It is important to decipher the mechanisms of Cisplatin drug resistance within these people. This experiment looks specifically at the protein HMOX2 and it’s role in this process. It was hypothesized that Heme Oxygenase 2 would be found in higher magnitudes within C13 cells than in 2008 cells and it would be responsible for the production of bilirubin, which in turn would neutralize free radicals and allow for decreased apoptosis within C13 cells. HMOX2 is responsible for the production of billirubin, which has been classified as a effective antioxidant. When there is increased amount of antioxidants within a cell the cell undergoes decreased apoptosis therefore it is logical to look into the protein HMOX2. The results of this experiment suggest that it is logical to look into the protein HMOX2 cells in C13 and 2008 might have a role in its resistance to Cisplatin. Further studies on the experiment could include the use of siRNA in order to block the expression of HMOX2 in C13 cells, and testing for IC 50 with cisplatin to determine whether HMOX2 plays a definitive role in cancer cell resistance to cisplatin.<br><br>

STUDY OF THE ANCHORING OF GLUTAMATE DECARBOXYLASE TO GABAERGIC SYNAPTIC VESICLE MEMBRANE
Eric Michael Cohen
Boca Raton Community High School, Boca Raton, Florida, USA

The purpose of this study was to investigate the anchoring mechanism of L-glutamicacid decarboxylase (GAD) to GABAergic Synaptic Vesicle Membrane. More specifically, I propose that Vesicular GABA Transporter protein (VGAT) is not necessary for GAD to anchor to the membrane. This study involved GAD’s two isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67. To test this, PC12 cell line was used as a cell model because they do not express VGAT, which was confirmed by RT-PCR. Three experiments were carried out: First, plasmid containing pcDNA 3.1/HisA- GAD65 cDNA were purified. Second, gene deliveries of GAD65 and GAD67 by Lipofectamine 2000TM into PC12 cells were preformed. Finally, the overexpression of GAD65 and the presence of Cysteine String Protein (CSP) were confirmed by immunoblotting. The data indicated that GAD65 was present in the membrane fraction of PC12 cells, leading to the conclusion that VGAT is not necessary for the anchoring. Together with the previous findings in the laboratory, a model was developed.<br><br>

G.U.M.: GERMS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
Rebecca Lynn Takacs
Boone Grove High School, Valparaiso, Indiana, United States

This project was designed to determine the effects of chewing gum on oral health, especially dental caries. Sucrose is cariogenic, which means it increases the risk of dental caries. The proposal was to determine if xylitol, a naturally occurring substitute sweetener, could decrease the occurrence of dental caries. <br><br> Due to the potential hazards of using S. mutans, non-pathogenic E. coli K12 strain was substituted. <br><br> A chewing machine was devised so that all tests would be uniform, and a base number of bacterial colonies was established using the chewing machine without any gum present.<br><br> After the control was established, eight tests were run using a xylitol-sweetened gum. Each test had ten control and ten experimental plates. After these eight tests were conducted, the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 48 hours, and then the colonies were counted. <br><br> After the colonies were counted and the data recorded, three additional tests were performed in the same manner, except a sucrose-sweetened gum was substituted for the xylitol-sweetened gum. <br><br> Xylitol exposure reduced the E. coli K12 strain colonies by an average of 75%. Exposure to the sucrose-sweetened gum increased the average number of colonies by 40%. The implications of this are twofold. First, xylitol can help to reduce the prevalence of cavities. Second, it may reduce the risk of heart infection due to migration of oral bacteria into the bloodstream.

INVESTIGATING THE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA) AGAINST METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS
Medha Chunduru
Capital High School, Olympia Washington, United States

Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) is an opportunistic pathogen that infects the epidermis of human beings; especially those with compromised immune systems, such as intravenous drug users, newborns and elderly patients. S. epidermidis is difficult to treat as it is resistant to higher class of antibiotics such as methicillin. Two drugs such as Vancomycin and Rifampicin can treat S. epidermidis; however these drugs are known to have many side effects such as kidney and liver damage. <br><br> In contrast to these antibacterial medications, natural herbal products are used all around the world to treat skin infections. Turmeric (Curcuma longa), a spice and medicament, was used in Indian and Chinese medicine to treat infections for many centuries and is still widely used. <br><br> This study investigated the antibacterial effect of turmeric (Curcuma longa), against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis. A 2.7 mg/ml turmeric solution in 30% ethyl alcohol was used in this study. S. epidermidis was plated on agar Petri dish with and without turmeric solution and incubated at 37C for 24 hours. Appropriate controls and replicates were run and bacterial colonies counted in each plate.<br><br> S. epidermidis bacteria was absent in the five Petri dishes treated with turmeric solution. The three controls, nutrient agar, ethyl alcohol solution, and turmeric-ethyl alcohol solution were clear indicating no contamination. This study clearly indicates that turmeric is an effective antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and also to check the antibacterial activity of turmeric against other strains of bacteria.<br><br>

T CELL SIGNALING IN DISEASE SETTINGS FOLLOWING ALLOGENEIC BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION
Melanie Yan-Yan Chow
Rye High School, Rye, New York, United States

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a potentially curative therapy for malignant and non-malignant diseases. Complications include graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), T cell immunodeficiency, and infection. I examined intracellular signaling profiles of alloreactive T cells and post-transplant thymocytes in murine models. Thymi and spleens from recipients of T cell depleted bone marrow were harvested at day 14, 21, and 28 post-BMT, and stained with novel antibodies to detect phosphorylated epitopes of signaling proteins. To examine in vivo the intracellular phosphorylation states of major signaling proteins from these mixed populations of donor T cells in BMT, I used a novel flow-cytometric technique and established a characteristic pattern of T cell signaling. Detected molecules included those involved in the MAP kinase signaling pathway, cytokine signaling, T cell costimulatory pathways, and apoptosis pathways. <br><br> Compared to normal mice, phosphorylation in the post-BMT murine thymus of the anti-apoptotic molecule Akt, was decreased by 100-fold; STAT-3 phosphorylation was deficient in the spleen. These abnormalities could account for delayed T cell reconstitution post-transplant. To study GVHD, carboxyfluorescein (CFSE) labeled T cells were infused into irradiated hosts. I noted gradual and global increases in signaling activity relative to the non-dividing CFSE^hi population with each cell division in the spleen, liver, and peripheral lymph nodes, indicating the progressive activation and expansion of alloreactive T cells, the chief mediators of GVHD. I hypothesize that IL-2, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TCR signaling mediate this signaling activation. <br><br> Overall, my studies define potentially novel drug targets for the treatment of immunodeficiency and GVHD in post-transplant settings.<br><br>

360° STEERABLE CATHETER UTILIZING NITINOL WIRE
Josh Paul Jones, Josh Jones
Wilcox-Hildreth Public School, Wilcox Nebraska, United States

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is still the number one cause of the death in United States. CHD can be prevented with proper diagnosis and treatment in which Catheters play a fundamental role. <br><br> I started with an investigation of catheters in use today and possible alternative ideas. Current catheters have many limitations while they are in arteries and veins. These limitations can prevent doctors from accurately diagnosing some coronary and vascular issues ranging from blocked arteries to internal bleeding. Various restrictions of existing catheters are due to the inadequacies of current technology. The mechanical properties within the medical technology seem to be the source of the problem. <br><br> My project is the development of a small catheter that utilizes four nitinol wires allowing it to have 360° steering capabilities. Catheters with 360° steering capabilities will allow further use in diagnosis and treatment of various medical issues. In order to steer the tip of my catheter, the wires on one side of the tip need to shorten, while wires on the other side of the tip need to lengthen. The symmetry of the arteries will not limit the efficiency and workability of this catheter, thereby greatly increasing the potential prevention of progressive coronary and vascular diseases that lead toward heart attacks.<br><br>

POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT, BEHAVIOR, AND MOTOR FUNCTION IN GROWTH RESTRICTED OFFSPRING
Antoinette Shani Dawson
Murrah High School, Jackson, MS, United States

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of intrauterine growth restriction on postnatal development, behavior, and motor function in low birth weight offspring. Two groups of animals were tested, normal birth weight (NBW) offspring and low birth weight (LBW) offspring. Beginning at day one, pups were weighed daily and assessed for neonatal milestones. As observed in previous studies, birth weight was reduced in the LBW as compared to the NBW (P<0.05). Litter size was also significantly reduced in LBW offspring as compared to NBW offspring (P<0.01). Forty-eight hours after birth, measurements were taken. LBW offspring were significantly shorter in length (P<0.05) and around the abdomen (P<0.05) as compared to NBW offspring. There was no significant difference in head circumference. In the pre-weaning stage, LBW offspring were significantly slower performing the following developmental tests as compared to NBW offspring: surface righting (P<0.05), negative geotaxis (P<0.01), cliff aversion (P<0.01), and open field assessment (P<0.05). In another group of animals, open-field and rotarod tests were assessed at four and six weeks of age in males and females. Neurobehavioral evaluation of the rats revealed no effects on motor function (rotarod) and activity level (open-field). These results suggest that reduced uterine perfusion results in intrauterine growth restriction that is not associated with motor deficiency in latter stages of development; however, earlier testing shows that there is a significant delay in developmental skills during the pre-weaning stages in LBW offspring as compared to NBW offspring.<br><br>

FRANKINCENSE OIL AS A NOVEL CANCER THERAPEUTIC AGENT: RESULTS OF A CLINICAL TRIAL IN EQUINE MELANOMA. A THIRD YEAR STUDY.
Carrie Elizabeth Shaw
Career Center High School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States

By 2010, one in fifty Americans will have melanoma, the most deadly skin cancer. Melanoma is rarely curable by conventional therapies, therefore new treatment strategies must be explored. The use of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAMs), including essential plant oils, is increasing. This study determined the effect of frankincense oil (FO) in human melanoma versus normal melanocytes in vitro and equine melanoma in vivo.<br><br> Using the MTT cell viability assay, 0.15 µg/mL FO caused 100% cell death in SKMEL28 human melanoma cells, but no cytotoxicity in normal melanocytes. FO-induced apoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) was determined by quantifying caspase-3 protein via western immunoblot. As FO concentration increased, total caspase-3 protein levels decreased in SKMEL28 human melanoma cells, indicating FO induced apoptosis. Normal human melanocytes did not exhibit apotosis. Based on these promising in vitro results, a clinical trial was developed to test FO in perianal equine melanoma. Tumors in 4 horses, treated with FO either topically or intratumorally for 14 days, developed visible ulceration and necrosis as early as 4 days. FO-treated normal skin developed reversible inflammation/ulceration. Post-treatment tumor biopsies showed a marked decrease in melanoma cell density and FO-induced apoptosis was detected via western immunoblot, confirming in vitro observations. The first treated horse (intratumoral administration) had a sustained clinical remission at 6 weeks post-treatment. <br><br> The results of this study provide both in vitro and in vivo data suggesting that frankincense oil is a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of melanoma. Human clinical trials utilizing FO are in development.<br><br>

CONTRIBUTION OF GP91PHOX IN CARDIAC APOPTOSIS AND INJURY POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
Dawn Zhao
White Station High

More than 180,000 victims die and 7,000,000 patients suffer from heart attack, or myocardial infarction (MI), annually in the United States. Following MI, the most important determinant factor for the outcome, one that usually determines the fate of the patient, is the degree of cardiac damage. It has been proven that apoptosis plays an important role in determining the extent of cardiac damage following MI. Because of the induced nature of apoptosis, its reduction is one vital treatment strategy for MI patients. Gp91phox has been thought to be the major pro-apoptosis factor, though there is still a dearth of evidence suggesting the connection between the two. In this study, we sought to determine such correlations, hypothesizing that gp91phox plays a significant role in inducing apoptosis following MI and the elimination of gp91phox would reduce apoptosis and its related injury. The temporal and spatial appearance of apoptosis and the expression of gp91phox were detected using TUNEL, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry; the results reveal a relationship between gp91phox and cardiac apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that that elimination of gp91phox reduces the apoptosis related heart injury following MI, revealing a promising future in the reduction of cardiac injury due to MI, which would eventually save thousands of lives.

BETA-CATENIN'S ROLE IN DRUG RESISTANCE
Cortney Nicole Ragatz
Frederick High School, Frederick, MD, USA

Cancer patients are treated using chemotherapy. A lot of the time the patient will progressively get better, but in some cases the patient will relapse. During relapse, the tumor cell no longer responds to drug and has acquired resistance. Our goal is to understand the pathways that cause drug resistance in order to find a drug that overcomes resistance.<br><br>We studied colon cell lines, which singly express mutant and wildtype beta-catenin that are more resistant to Etoposide, a DNA damaging drug. Because Wnt Signaling, the signal transduction pathway containing beta-catenin, may be responsible for drug resistance, we evaluated the cellular location of beta-catenin, and its location after drug treatment. We also studied p53 baseline levels and response to drug.<br><br>We found mutant beta-catenin at the nucleus, and wild type beta-catenin at the membrane in untreated cells. However, with drug treatment, for both alleles beta-catenin went to the nucleus. In addition, it was found that there was more nuclear p53 present in mutant beta-catenin cell lines compared to wild type beta-catenin. However, in response to drug, p53 consistently translocated to the nucleus for cell lines expressing either allele. Thus nuclear p53 varies with beta-catenin allele and further studies are needed to define any signaling pathway difference in response to drug.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF UNPROCESSED AND OZONATED LEPTOSPERMUM SCOPARIUM HONEY ON CACO2 (COLON CANCER) CELL PROLIFERATION, IN VITRO
Elena Kurtz Ovaitt
West Platte High School, Weston, Missouri, U.S.A

Ozonation is an acknowledged way to kill bacteria, but little is known about its effects on honey’s medicinal components. In preliminary investigations, results indicated that ozone increased the antibacterial effect of Leptospermum scoparium honey. This project aimed to investigate the inhibitory properties of honey on the inhibition of cancer cells. The study concerns the effects of unprocessed and ozonated Leptospermum scoparium honey on Caco2 (colon cancer) cell proliferation, in vitro. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 55,000 people will die from colon cancer in 2006. With such a large number of prevalent deaths, determining an alternative cure is vital.<br><br> Serial dilutions of 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% unprocessed Leptospermum scoparium honey were applied to Caco2 cells. This was repeated with ozonated Leptospermum scoparium honey to determine if ozone would change the honey’s antitumor effect. For this study, an MTS assay was used to measure cell proliferation. The results of the study demonstrate that the administration of Leptospermum scoparium honey at all serial dilutions is effective against Caco2 cell proliferation, in vitro. Statistical analysis indicates ozonated honey is more effective in inhibiting Caco2 cell proliferation than unprocessed Leptospermum scoparium honey. Unprocessed Leptospermum scoparium honey may be a viable alternative for colon cancer treatments, and ozonated Leptospermum scoparium honey may be more potent in cancer treatment than Leptospermum scoparium honey by itself. The results are promising, and further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism in honey which inhibits cell proliferation. <br><br>

THE ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS OF ECHINACEA
Emily Danielle Reinbold
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD USA

The purpose of this study was to test the antiviral effects of Echinacea, an herbal extract derived from Echinacea Purpurea. Also the study examined differences of Echinacea's effects between RNA and DNA viruses.<br><br> First Echinacea was extracted and prepared to a concentration of 50mg/ml in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The Echinacea was filtered through a syringe filter. Next the viruses were prepared to a 0.001 concentration. A cell culture system was then mock infected by each virus and treated with Echinacea. The cells were incubated for five days. The cells were examined for cell death every day and virus supernatant was collected for later use in virus titration. Next the virus titration was prepared. Virus supernatant was mixed with medium to create different dilutions of the virus. The dilutions were added to new cells and incubated for 5 days. Next the cells were examined for viral infection and the percent infection for each dilution was determined.<br><br> Analysis of the data showed that Echinacea did have antiviral effects against PRRSV. Echinacea prevented cell infection in the Marc-145 cells at all levels of dosages used. On the other hand, Echinacea had no antiviral effect on MCMV and all of the cells treated with the virus were infected. Yet Echinacea had drastic effects on the cells treated with PRRSV and produced cells at 0% infectivity at all levels of the titration.

THE ROLE OF KERATINS AS SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES FOR LIVER DISEASE IN AFROAMERICANS
Farnoosh Nik-Ahd
California High School, San Ramon, California, USA

Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/K18) are cytoskeletal proteins that protect the liver from stress of multiple etiologies. Ku et al. previously identified K8/K18 mutations in 58 of 467 liver disease patients and 13 of 349 controls (12.4% vs. 3.7%; p<0.0001) from an ethnically diverse cohort, some of which decrease keratin solubility or phosphorylation. Such variants therefore represent a risk factor for development of end-stage liver disease. This study also identified the two K8 variants, Y54H and G434S, in 26 African American patients that were not present in over 400 non-African Americans. I hypothesized that ethnic-specific differences in K8 variant frequency exist. To address this hypothesis, I analyzed a cohort of African American patients with liver disease for the presence of K8/K18 variants. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 26 African American patients with liver disease. Exonic regions were PCR-amplified and analyzed for the presence of mutations using DHPLC and DNA sequencing. Several K8 variants were identified including one Y54H, two A333A, three G434S and one V480I. One of these variants (V480I) had not previously been found in liver disease patients. No K18 variants were detected. In contrast, the R341H variant, commonly found in Non-African Americans, was not detected in any of the tested African American samples. K8 (Y54H and G434S) variants were seen in 15.3% of African Americans but were present in <1% of Non-African Americans. Therefore, these mutations are strongly associated with African American ethnicity, and may prove to be important biomarkers of liver disease progression.

MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF PAIN INVOLVING FREE RADICALS
Shayma Adil Hasan
Glenwood High School, Chatham IL, USA

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals in neurons and their involvement in chronic pain. Results from this study will also help further understand how antioxidants benefit certain chronic pain conditions such as those associated with diabetes and arthritis. <br><br>Dorsal root ganglia neurons were cultured from embryonic mice and grown in nerve growth factor and treated with 1µM of capsaicin. DCFDA fluorescent dye was used to detect ROS levels and fluorescent images were taken using a fluorescent microscope. The determination of increases in intracellular calcium was determined using calcium fluorescent, fluo-4, AM dye and calcium imaging was performed using IP Lab Software. Cells were treated with FDA fluorescence and PI fluorescence in order to detect live and dead cells, respectively. Lastly, Student’s ‘t’ test was used and P value of <0.05 was taken as significant. <br><br>Pain is carried by a receptor called TRPV1. Slight increases in reactive oxygen species cause increased expression of the pain sensing receptor, TRPV1. Increased expression of TRPV1 is revealed by an increased Ca2+ influx. However, excessive increase in ROS and Ca2+ can cause cell death. Therefore, this study indicates that antioxidants, which are used to reduce ROS levels, could be beneficial in alleviating chronic pain conditions.<br><br>

POSSIBLE RADIOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF N-ACETYLCYSTEINE IN LX-1 SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA CELLS
Michael Lev Rutenberg Schoenberg
Woodrow Wilson High School, Portland, Oregon, USA

Possible radioprotective effects of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) were tested in LX1 small cell lung carcinoma cells. NAC, a thiol antioxidant, had previously been found to protect cells against platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents. Radiation and platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents have both been found to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, by causing reactive oxygen species that active the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through cell cycle control proteins. It was hypothesized that NAC would protect cells against radiation, because NAC's antioxidant property and because of the similarity between the mechanisms by which radiation and platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents kill cells. Radioprotection was measured by Trypan Blue addition for growth and viability assays and by protein immunoblotting. In both the growth and viability assays, cells were counted using a hemacytometer after addition of Trypan Blue to mark dead cells. The protein immunoblotting assay was used to measure levels of proteins associated with the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by cell cycle control proteins. Proteins measured in the protein immunoblotting assay included PARP (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase), caspase-3, caspase-9, p53, and p21. Experimental results suggest that NAC has some protective effect against radiation doses up to 100 Rad.<br><br>Note: Irradiation of cell cultures was conducted by qualified scientists.

FUNCTIONAL CONSERVATION OF TELOMERASE FROM FISH TO HUMANS: IMPLICATIONS FOR NOVEL MODELS OF AGING AND CANCER
Sohini Sircar
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School, Richmond, Virginia, USA

Scientists believe they have finally discovered the vital key in the longstanding search for the eternal fountain of youth and a cancer-free world. Studies show that telomeres and telomerase are critically important in human aging and cancer. The researcher characterized telomerase and telomere lengths in fish based on the hypothesis that zebrafish and Japanese medaka would serve as better vertebrate models for human disease than mice in terms of telomerase activity and telomere length. It was also hypothesized that telomerase genes would be functionally conserved from fish to human.<br><br>Cells from both zebrafish and Japanese medaka were cultured. In order to directly test for telomerase conservation, the human catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) and dominant-negative hTERT (DN-hTERT) were stably expressed in fish cells, and changes in telomerase activity were assessed using the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol. Elevated telomerase activity detected in fish cell cultures expressing hTERT, while lower levels were found in DN-hTERT lines. A telomere length assay was performed, showing that fish telomeres are more human-like in length than telomeres from mice. Lastly, the researcher attempted to clone and sequence the TERT gene using fish genomic DNA. A 200bp fragment containing an intron and splice sites was cloned and sequenced. Together, the data suggests functional conservation of telomerase components between fish and human and telomere lengths in fish resembling those observed in humans. If additional research supports the hypothesis, experiments that utilize zebrafish and Japanese medaka could define fish as appropriate models of human disease, including aging and cancer.<br><br>

The purpose of this project is to study the correlation between total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity by comparing TPC and antioxidant properties in different brands of green tea and black tea. The health benefits of brewed tea and tea leaf particles were analyzed. Decaffeinated green and black teas as well as flavored green and black teas were tested for health benefits compared to regular green and black teas.<br><br>Sample extracts were taken from each sample and three replicates were prepared. For TPC, distilled water, Folin-Denis reagent, and saturated sodium carbonate were added to a vial with each sample extract and calculated using a spectrophotometer at an absorbance of 730 nm. The absorbance values were converted to concentration measured in mg/mL by using a tannic acid standard curve equation. For antioxidant activity, DPPH solution was added to a vial with each sample extract and calculated using a spectrophotometer at an absorbance of 515 nm. Antioxidant activity percentage values were obtained using an antioxidant equation. <br><br>Data analysis showed that by brewing the tea, TPC increased and antioxidant activity decreased a significant amount. The decaffeinated teas tested highest in TPC and were higher among the regular teas in antioxidants, but tested lower than the tea leaf particles. To conclude, tea leaf particles have an abundant amount of antioxidants needed in order to maintain a healthy body preventing and repairing damage caused by free radical attack.<br><br>

A NEW TARGET TO FIGHT BREAST CANCER: HHB1-DELTAN
Melissa Victoria Sussman
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, New York, United States

The role of hHb1-deltaN, a hair keratin discovered in breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, was previously unknown. I used microarray analysis and found that when hHb1-deltaN was blocked, the ability of AKT2, an enzyme that promotes proliferation of cancer cells, was diminished as was the quantitative number of viable HeLa cells. hHb1-deltaN was found to arrest naturally occurring cell death (apoptosis) of cancerous cells, as well as being a cancerous cell proliferators. Once Anti-Src was added to HeLa cell cultures to target the hHb1-deltaN, diminution of the HeLa cells was seen through counting cells over the course of set time periods. This coincided with the reduction of AKT2, a protein which diminishes apoptosis in cells and has been known to increase cancer cell survival, as well as promote drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatinum. <br><br> The amount of hHb1-deltaN present correlated directly with the amount and viability of the HeLa cells. hHb1-deltaN’s presence in the various tumors could lead to its use as a new tumor marker to detect early stages of cancer, as well as become a target for the attachment of potent chemotherapeutic agents in order to destroy cancer cells.<br><br>

INCORPORATION AND MAXIMIZATION OF SYNTHETIC PENICILLIN PRODUCTION IN TRANSGENIC LEMNA MINOR
Zachary Scott Solomon
Long Beach High School, Long Beach NY, USA

Using the procedure for genetic engineering created in prior experimentation, this investigation altered the free floating aquatic plant, Lemna minor or duckweed, to produce synthetic, but human compatible penicillin. In addition, the auxin Indole-3-Acetic Acid was incorporated in attempt to maximize production. <br><br>Four-hundred eighty fronds of Lemna minor were successfully genetically altered utilizing Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Each sample contained 20 of these fronds in a culture medium. There were six samples per type of alteration: Penicillin and IAA (PA), Control for Growth Regulator and Penicillin (CP), IAA and Sterile Water Control (AC), Control for Growth Regulator and Sterile Water Control (CC). Penicillin ‘overlay’ plate tests showed that only PA and CP samples produced penicillin. Statistical t-tests exposed that the concentrations at which CP’s produced penicillin were not substantial, while the concentrations of the PA cultures were. Thus, penicillin was effectively produced by transgenic duckweed with incorporation of Indole-3-Acetic Acid. In only one week, these PA cultures (120 fronds) secreted approximately 35mL of penicillin, nearly a month’s worth of reconstituted aqueous solution for one person at the 500,00units/mL concentration. Successful penicillin production in Lemna minor verifies the possibility of Plant Made Pharmaceuticals and the ideal nature of duckweed for such biotechnological applications.<br><br>

THE ANALYSIS OF SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA RELATED ONCOGENE'S FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN E3 LIGASE UBIQUITINATION PATHWAY
Manish Ashok Shaha
John L. Miller Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY, USA

Ubiquitination is a recently identified process which tags selected proteins with ubiquitin protein molecules and leads to their destruction through proteasomes found in a cell. This pathway is extremely active in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma cell lines. A protein called SCCRO as well as a recently identified homologue was shown to be over-expressed in these same cell lines. The ubiquitination pathway relied on the E3 sequence of several proteins combining to form the SCF complex which eventually moves a ubiquitin molecule onto a selected target protein. The main protein in this SCF complex is called Cullin. Cullin has been found to be the regulatory mechanism in this protein degradation pathway and it is understood to be inhibited in its activity until a protein called Nedd8 is able to attach to Cullin's structure. The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of the identified SCCRO gene on Cullin and its potential role in the neddylation of Cullin which leads to the formation of the SCF complex. Through positional cloning strategies, four cloned gene constructs were made and one construct was used in a GST-Pulldown assay. This assay produced results identifying a potential binding partnet of Nedd8 at the same size of SCCRO protein.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CANINE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND SPECIAL STAINS
Alissa Michelle Aron
Ballard High School, Seattle, WA, USA

Immunohistochemistry and special stains were utilized to determine the reliability of a canine embryonic stem cell (ESC) model for predicting human embryonic stem cell (hESC) behavior. The expression of various known ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal stem cell markers has been shown in human, primate and rodent models. This study, for the first time, tested the effectiveness of these markers in canine ESCs, as an indicator of the validity of a canine model. It was hypothesized that canine ESCs would express the same markers seen in human, primate and rodent stem cells, and that cartilage and collagen would not be found using alcian blue and Masson trichrome stains. After the immunohistochemical and special staining was completed, the majority of the tested antibodies were found to be expressed in the canine ESCs, and cartilage was also present. In the United States today, moral and political issues prevent extensive research from being conducted directly on hESCs. Based on the results of this study, it is expected that a canine ESC model will prove to be effective in typifying hESCs, providing an accessible model in which to conduct preliminary ESC research.

CHRONIC HEXOSAMINE FLUX ACTIVATES AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE IN ADIPOCYTES: AN EXPLANATION FOR THE METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES
Mark Gordon Evans
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, Utah, U.S.A.

Chronic stimulation of the nutrient-sensing Hexosamine Biosynthesis Pathway (HBP) can result in insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as an “energy fuel gauge” that phosphorylates downstream targets, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation once activated. My project demonstrated the effects of chronic hexosamine flux on AMPK activity in mice adipocytes.<br><br> Cultured mice adipocytes were treated with low glucose (2.5 mM), high glucose (20 mM), or glucosamine (2.5 mM glucose and 10 mM glucosamine) in the presence or absence of the HBP inhibitor diazooxonorleucine (DON). AMPK assays were performed by purifying the kinase with an antibody and exposing it to a radioactive cocktail. Next, the AMPK activity was measured by a liquid scintillation beta counter. Additionally, assays were performed on transgenic mice fat pads with chronic increased hexosamine flux resulting from an overexpression of a rate-limiting enzyme known as glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA). Finally, western blotting confirmed increased phosphorylation of ACC. <br><br> The collected data revealed a 1.5 fold and 2.5 fold increase in AMPK activity following exposure to high glucose and glucosamine concentrations respectively in cultured adipocytes. Exposure to DON inhibited the kinase’s function. Additionally, the transgenic fat pads exhibited a 54% increase in AMPK activity. Thus, chronic hexosamine flux results in the activation of AMPK, which leads to phosphorylation of ACC and increased fatty acid oxidation. This link is a mechanism by which excess nutrients contribute to the metabolic syndromes of type 2 diabetes. <br><br> <br><br>

SOCK-AID: HELP FOR THE ELDERLY AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED
Gitte Ahlquist Jonsson
EUC Lolland, Soevej 6, DK-4900 Nakskov, DENMARK

Putting on socks and taking them off again is a daily arduous task for many persons worldwide- for the physically handicapped or elderly, it can be impossible. The existing aids are very impractical: both patients and physiotherapists are dissatisfied, and many patients and physiotherapists are dissatisfied, and many patients prefer not to use them at all. In addition, these aids only assist in putting socks on, and do not help to take them off again.<br><br>I have invented a new aid which can assist the elderly, physically disabled, or recently operated persons. Unlike the existing products, my Sock-Aid can be used to put socks on and to take them off again. Putting socks on and off may seem an insignificant task, but using my Sock-Aid gives independence and leads to increased dignity for many persons who otherwise would have to ask for help.<br><br>My Sock-Aid has been successfully tested on disabled people and is very popular. It can be produced for different sizes and indeed fitted to the individual, should this prove necessary.<br><br>The ‘simple’ task of taking socks off has resulted in many falls leading to admission to hospital. Therefore, my Sock-Aid would also result in savings within the health sector.<br><br>Finally, my Sock-Aid will be inexpensive – even when produced in stainless steel for strength, durability and cleanliness – and is thus ‘environmentally friendly’.<br><br>Thus my Sock-Aid is easy to use and effective, inexpensive and will be welcomed by the elderly, handicapped and those with problems to bend.<br><br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF LUDWIGIA OCTOVALVIS EXTRACT AND ITS FUNGICIDAL EFFECT ON TRICHOPHYTON RUBRUM, MICROSPORUM GYPSEUM AND MICROSPORUM COOKEI IN VITRO.
Xavier Alexis Cruz
Elvira Colon Negron, Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico

In this research Ludwigia octovalvis leaves extract was used as a natural remedy for the control of infections caused by fungi: Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum gypseum and Microsporum cookei. Dilutions of the extract were prepared in 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 concentrations. Concentration discs were saturated with the 1/10 extract dilution. Five discs were placed in each of the agar plates containing the different fungi. The positive control was prepared with an antifungicide. The negative control was prepared using sterile water to test the extract effects by measuring the inhibition ring. Concentration discs were saturated with the natural leaves extract and with 1/10 pasteurized extract dilution. The inhibition ring obtained using the pasteurized extract in Trichophyton rubrum after 48 hours was 2.1 cm, and with the 1/10 dilution, it was 3.2 cm. Using the pasteurized natural extract in Microsporum gypseum the inhibitory ring was 3.0 cm and with the 1/10 extract dilution it was 2.7 cm. The natural pasteurized extract was inoculated to Microsporum cookie the inhibitory ring measure was 3.0 cm and with 1/10 dilution was 2.7 cm. The inhibition ring was bigger in fungi after the pasteurization process. In a previous research it was found that the extract of Ludwigia octovalvis inhibited the bacterial growth and now it also inhibited fungi growth at all dilutions. In the chromatography test, chlorophyll A, B and xanthophylls were obtained. The extract has saponins, tannin, alkaloids and flavonoids. The natural compound of Ludwigia octovalvis is cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid. The Brine Shrimp Lethality test was negative.

EATING HABITS IN THE ADOLESCENTS' INTEGRAL HEALTH
Lynette Vega
Luis Munoz Marin Senior High School, Yabucoa, Puerto Rico

Experts in medicine, nutrition and prevention coincide in that the health of the Puerto Ricans is deteriorating due to their life styles and to the deficiencies of the health system.<br><br> Based in this information the investigator wanted to find: How does the eating habits affect the integral health of the adolescents? The hypothesis under study was that youngsters don’t consume nutritious foods that are necessary for a good diet and healthy development. <br><br> A questionnaire was prepared for this investigation and validated by a health professional with one hundred high school students whose ages varied from 15 to 17 years. The validated questionnaire was then administered to another group of 100 students from the same school. The data was analyzed and indicated that 43% of the adolescents consume three meals daily and many indicated that they use to have no breakfast because they don’t like to eat early. 75% preferred homemade food rich in carbohydrates. 53% indicated that they are not used to eat every day at the same time. 16% of the participants eat before bedtime and 56% do not eat the adequate quantity of each portion of food for their age. 45% do some kind of physical exercise to maintain a good health. It was revealed that the eating habit of 36% of the adolescents has caused them some health problems. 39% of the adolescents sometimes eat adequately. It is concluded that the majority of the adolescents suffer from illnesses and conditions as a consequence of their eating habits. <br><br>

VIEWING NUTRITIONS EFFECT ON BLOOD THROUGH DARK FIELD MICROSCOPY
Christopher Thomas Kady
Tri-city College Prep High School, Prescott, Arizona, United States of America

The purpose of this project is to show whether or not nutrition actually affects your blood stream on a very short term basis; meaning what kinds of change will show up in minutes, hours, and days. <br><br> The question in the project is, “what does nutrition actually do to your blood, and what amount of time is needed to see change.” My hypothesis is that “the blood will change immediately. This is due to research done prior to the experimentation. This research was first conducted through an epidemiology project in which I discussed how nutrients in blood may have an affect on the development of pancreatic cancer.” <br><br> The experimentation began with looking at the longer term affects by not consuming any food or water for 24 hours. I began to look at the changes shown on a daily basis. I was careful not to make any drastic changes through the duration of this particular part of the experimentation, such as consuming something out of the guidelines of a diet I created. This diet was one that was consistently changing over the period of about one week from eating food that had an acidic ash to eating foods that had a basic ash. Aside from the main parts of the diet, I show how important it is to have controlled glucose and lipid intakes and how excessive carbohydrates stay in the blood for many hours after consuming those particular rations, long after carbohydrates should have visibly dissipated in the blood.<br><br>

FINDING A LINK AMONG CA2+ SIGNALING, APOPTOSIS AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES TO DEVELOP NOVEL TREATMENTS
Eric Nelson Delgado
Bayonne High School, Bayonne, New Jersey, United States 

Recent research has made it plausible that the link between Ca2+ signaling and apoptosis is related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This study proposed a pathway which associates neuronal Ca2+ influx, cytochrome C release and Ca2+ release with neurodegenerative diseases. The study tests the validity of this pathway through the observation of the effectiveness of treatments specific to the pathway. The treatments utilized were Ifenprodil, Zn2+and heparin. Digital imaging fluorescence microscopy was utilized to monitor changes in physical condition and changing Ca2+ levels in CATH.a neurons. Caspase 3, 7 assays were utilized to monitor the quantity of caspases which cause apoptosis. <br><br> Results show that Ifenprodil caused a change of 8% in both the Ca2+ imaging and the caspase assay. It caused significant signaling complications. Heparin caused a 39% change; Zn caused 54% change. Both did not cause significant signaling complications. Ifenprodil was ineffective because it could not control the Ca2+ influx. Zn and Heparin were highly effective because the treatments were associated with processes occurring later in the proposed pathway. This study has generally proven the validity of the pathway and also provides a general baseline into pharmaceutical research related to this and similar pathways.<br><br>

THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF KOREA TRADITIONAL HUB MEDICINE IN GU-JUNG-GU-PYO METHOD (NINE BOILED & NINE DRIED METHOD)
Bo Hyun Nam
Chongnam Science High School, SOUTH KOREA

Many problems also appeared with the results of the scientific method, however, and as an alternative, a method was found to analyze and apply traditional methods with the scientific method. Of those, R.Radix preparata, unlike other drugs, is manufactured with a traditional Korean herb-brewing method called Nine Steaming and Nine Drying. <br><br> Paying attention to this, we have proceeded to perform a scientific analysis on R.Radix preparata and gujeunggupo. The result of TLC analysis showed that 5-HMF, an index material, showed strong spots only on R.Radix preparata. The result of doing HPLC analysis for a more precise analysis showed that the density of 5-HMF increased according to the number of times it was brewed, and after the 9th steaming and drying, only a minute density change was measured. <br><br> Also, after using ginseng, we carried out a scientific analysis using these as subjects. In terms of physical changes, the ginseng slowly changed from a red shade to a black shade. As the number of steaming and drying process increased, saponin, an index material, was extracted using the Shibata method, and as a result of measuring its quantity change with HPLC, we found that the main ginsenoside changed from a PD ginsenoside to a PT ginsenoside, which is a special ginsenoside. The amount of saponin in the PT ginsenoside was shown to be the highest after the 9th steaming and drying. <br><br> In all the experiments, the amount of index material was measured the highest after the 9th steaming and drying; through these experiments, therefore, we could establish a scientific foundation regarding the traditional herb-brewing process. Through a steamed black ginseng production of ginseng that had not been attempted before, we maximized ginseng’s pharmaceutical elements, made it easy to store, and produced a more effective drug for absorption in the body.

EFFECTS OF MMP-CARRYING INFLAMMATORY LEUKOCYTES ON TUMOR CELL INTRAVASATION 2ND YEAR STUDY
Joanne Yula Zhang
Torrey Pines High School, San Diego, CA, USA

Clinical data have demonstrated that chronic inflammation can lead to cancer. This research focuses on the effects of inflammatory leukocytes—specifically chicken neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages—on tumor cell intravasation (entrance of vasculature) and metastasis.<br><br>The chick embryo model was used to mimic in vivo conditions and the human fibrosarcoma cell lines 45a and 47a. Tumor cells from these lines were planted separately on the chorioallantoic membrane of the egg and allowed to intravasate. (Student did not directly handle chick embryo model, but used tissues and tumors from it.)<br><br>Western blotting determined the concentrations of chicken MMP-9 and MMP-13 around 45a and 47a tumors. Zymography identified the MMPs as collagenases. These MMPs are vital for tumor cell intravasation. Neutrophils are known to produce MMP-9 while monocytes/macrophages produce MMP-13. <br><br>Tissue samples of the lower chorioallantoic membrane and liver were homogenized to extract DNA for PCR analysis. DNA samples underwent alu PCR analysis to detect tumor cell presence due to intravasation and metastasis. Data showed 47a with higher intravasation and metastasization rates than 45a. <br><br>Immunohistochemical analysis visualized neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages around the tumor/chorioallantoic membrane boundary. The results confirmed that 47a had more inflammatory cells per unit tissue than 45a.<br><br>This concludes that tumor cells are aided by inflammatory cells producing MMP-9 and MMP-13 at the tumor site. By reducing or eliminating inflammation, we could limit tumor intravasation and, in turn, metastasis. Future studies would investigate the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on tumor cell intravasation.<br><br>

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION OF EARLY DISEASE MARKERS IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS
Phillip Yanhua Zhang
Torrey Pines High School, Encinitas, California, USA

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or “Lou Gehrig’s Disease”) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of motor neurons, causing complete paralysis and death by respiratory failure within three to five years in human patients. The exact cause of motor neuron degeneration remains unknown. Thus far, scientists have identified a number of genes that differ in mRNA expression between healthy and ALS mice, even before they show symptoms. As proteins are the base for cellular functions and changes at the mRNA level do not necessarily cause changes in the expression of corresponding proteins, I selected three specific proteins coded by previously identified genes for further examination. Through the application of immunohistochemistry, I compared the level of these proteins in spinal cord tissue taken from healthy and diseased mice. <br><br> My experimental results showed that expression levels of all three proteins correlate with the known mRNA expression increase, but their temporal patterns were different. Two of the proteins tested, GFAP and Urocortin, showed significant changes only in the late stages of the disease, and may therefore not be useful for early detection of the disease. However, the remaining protein, TGFalpha, showed significant difference between healthy and diseased mice at a relatively early age. As TGFalpha protein is secreted from cells, it has the potential to be used for the early detection of ALS using relatively non-invasive methods. Additional research is warranted, as detection of early disease markers will be critical for the diagnosis and treatment of ALS.<br><br>

SILENCING OF GENE EXPRESSION IN NEUROSPORA CRASSA THROUGH TARGETED MRNA CLEAVAGE
Srikanth Kodali
John B. Connally High School, Austin TX, United States of America

N. crassa strains which were stably transformed by integration of the ccg-2p::mluc sequence at the his-3 sequence were isolated and plated on potato dextrose medium with firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferin additive, and light-induced expression of luciferase was induced. Quelling of luciferase expression in N. crassa was achieved while using dsRNA as the original stimulus in the gene silencing pathway. Exogenous dsRNAs, in this case, firefly beetle luciferase dsRNA, if homologous to the endogenous or transgene transcripts, can serve as the trigger of co-suppression, and reduce gene activity from 70-95%. Interestingly, when N. crassa was initially being transformed, up to 61% of the samples failed to be transformed and approximately 44% of the successfully transformed samples reverted back to the wild-type phenotype. It is not thought that the reason for the large proportion of samples that were untransformed was silencing. Transgenes and their foreign transcripts may be recognized by RdRP as an aberrant, and expression of these transgenes were seen to be silenced.

SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS AT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESIVENESS OF COLON CANCER IN AFRICAN AMERICAN PATIENTS
Rahul Ram Goli
The Altamont School, Birmingham AL, USA

Background: Studies have reported an increased mortality for African-Americans with colonic adenocarcinomas (CACs) when compared to Caucasians. To understand the molecular basis for this disparity, we assessed the mutational patterns of the p53 gene and microsatellite instability (MSI) in high-grade CACs of African-American and Caucasian patients and correlated these results with their survival.<br><br>Materials and Methods: The DNA samples were isolated from high-grade CACs and matching control tissues collected from 27 African-American and 32 Caucasian patients. The status of the p53 gene was assessed by direct sequencing of the entire coding region. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed with 5-oligonucleotide primer sets to assess the MSI status of 5 specific loci. Chi-square analysis and univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to asses the prognostic sgnificance of molecular alterations.<br><br>Results: Similar proportions of high-grade CACs from African-American and Caucasian patients have exhibited MSIand missense point mutations at hotspot codons of the p53 gene. However, single nucleotide polymorphic mutations at codon 72 were more frequent in African-Americans (33%) than in Caucasians (9%). African-Americans with SNPs at codon 72 which exhibit the phenotypes, Proline/Proline (33%) or Arginine/Proline (37%) had higher mortality than those with the phenotype Arginine/Arginine (30%), such a difference in mortality was not observed in Caucasian patients.<br><br>Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that the SNP pattern at codon 72 of the p53 gene differs in high-grade CRCs collected from African-American and Caucasian patients; specifically, the phenotypes Arg/Pro or Pro/Pro of p53 are associated with poor clinical outcome of African-American patients.<br><br>

A WALK IN THE PARK: DETERMINING THE NORMAL GAIT OF CHILDREN
Emily Claire Boden
Midland Senior High School, Midland, Texas, USA

The purpose of this project was to collect temporospatial gait data and use this data to determine diagnostic averages with standard deviations. This data could then be compared to the gait cycles of children with walking disabilities to help pinpoint and solve specific gait problems. The data was obtained using subjects in the 5-year to 12-year age range.<br><br> The normals for each gender and age were obtained by taking the GAITRite system to elementary schools and having students walk over the mat during their physical education classes. For each child, a code name, leg lengths, age, and gender were saved into the system. Each child then walked across the mat three times at their own pace, looking forward, with their arms at their sides.<br><br> The collected data was then transferred to Excel and using the third trial from each child, an average and standard deviation were calculated and graphed. These averages and standard deviations were obtained from the gait data of 135 students who had normal gait cycles. The final result is a set of sixteen graphs, one for each gender and age, which depict the normal ranges for important aspects of the gait cycle. <br><br> The product of this project is a useful diagnostic tool which can be used by physical therapists to determine exactly what is wrong with a child’s gait. When compared to each other, the charts also show variations in the gait cycle that occur by age and between the two genders.<br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF CURCUMA LONGA AND ITS GROWTH IMPEDIMENT EFFECTS ON SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AND ESCHERICHIA COLI
Nhila Jagadeesan
Lake Central High School, St.John, IN, USA

The purpose was to determine the antimicrobial properties of Curcuma longa when applied to fungus and bacteria.<br><br> Hypothesis 1 stated that if slices of bread were misted with dilutions of turmeric, the slices with the turmeric will exhibit fungus later than the ones misted with plain water. Hypothesis 2 stated that turmeric will have an inhibiting effect on S.cerevisiae. Hypothesis 3 dealt with the components of turmeric which are dissolvable in water and those are dissolvable in oil. It stated that there would be no significant difference in the growth impediment properties of turmeric in either dilution on E.coli.<br><br> In the 1st experiment, bread slices were applied with 1:10 serial dilutions of turmeric, placed in plastic bags and observed for 5 days. In the 2nd experiment, yeast was grown in 1:10 serial dilutions of turmeric in 5% sucrose solution. The time it took for yeast to reproduce to a certain amount was recorded. In the 3rd experiment, 1:10 and other serial dilutions of water-turmeric and oil-turmeric solutions were applied to disks and were set in E.coli. After a day, the inhibition zones around the disks were measured. The control in all 3 experiments contained no turmeric.<br><br> The results were that, the bread slices misted with the control developed colonies of fungus more quickly than the sliced misted with dilutions of turmeric. In the 2nd experiment, yeast in control grew more rapidly than yeast in the dilutions of turmeric. In the 3rd experiment, there were inhibition zones around the disks with water-based and oil-based turmeric dilutions. The inhibition rates of the two dilutions had no significant difference.<br><br>Therefore all three hypotheses were proven correct. So turmeric exhibits antimicrobial properties.<br><br>

SHAKE AND BAKE: IT'S NOT JUST FOR DINNER ANYMORE THE EFFECTS OF SV40 LARGE T-ANTIGEN ON SKIN PHENOTYPE IN VDR-NULL MICE
Elizabeth Blair Laing
Lakeshore High School, Stevensville, MI, USA

This experiment was done to determine the causes of the unusual skin phenotype observed in the vitamin D receptor null (VDRKO) and large probasin T-antigen (LPBTag) mice. It was my hypothesis that the normal VDRKO skin phenotype was being aggravated by the presence of the SV40 Tag. In order to determine the morphology of the skin, samples were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Samples were also stained by immunohistochemistry to determine proliferation levels by PCNA, keratin localization, and presence of SV40 Tag. SV40 Tag was found with greatest frequency in the LPBTag/ VDRKO mice. A moderate amount of SV40 Tag was present in the LPBTag/VDRWT mice and none was present in the non-transgenic/VDRKO animals. High levels of PCNA and keratin were found in all of the LPBTag/VDRKO samples. Moderate levels were found in the LPBTag/VDRWT and non-transgenic/VDRKO samples as well. It was determined that normal hyperproliferation of epidermal keratinocytes due to loss of VDR lead to an excess keratin buildup on the skin surface and that the addition of SV40 Tag exacerbated this condition causing further increase in proliferation and keratin deposition resulting in the unusual skin phenotype termed “shake and bake.”

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN BIOFLUIDOME
Luyi Zhao
Parkway South High, Manchester MO, USA

An understanding of the functional distribution of the biofluid proteome, or biofluidome, remains limited. Such an understanding would not only provide insight into biofluids, but also help direct searches for clinically relevant biomarkers in the biofluidome.<br><br> To examine the functional distributions of biofluids, human amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, saliva, serum, synovial fluid, tear, and urine proteomes were obtained from the literature. Protein identifiers were converted to GI numbers, screened to remove non-human and redundant proteins, and annotated through the Gene Ontology (GO) system to create the largest collection of non-redundant and annotated human biofluid proteins to date. The GO annotation of the biofluidome was compared with the annotations of other human proteomes such as the whole human proteome, represented by human NCBI Refseq proteins. The breadth and depth of the functional annotations of biofluids were also examined, and statistically enriched and under-enriched GO terms were then found. <br><br> The biofluidome was found to contain the majority of GO terms annotated in the Refseq dataset, but a substantial portion of terms annotated in the Refseq dataset were absent from the biofluidome. Breadth and depth measurements of the functional annotations of biofluids suggested a biased distribution of GO terms. The presence of such a biased distribution was further supported by the high prevalence of GO enrichment found in biofluids. Interestingly, under-enrichment was much less prevalent than enrichment. This work presents the most comprehensive functional analysis of the human biofluidome to date and should significantly add to our knowledge of clinically important biofluids.

This study was conducted to determine the plausibility of transmitting intelligible speech through the skull via bone conduction at normal frequencies from a piezoelectric transducer. It was hypothesized that speech transmitted in this manner would be intelligible and that the intelligibility would improve with the use of a frequency filter. Subjective testing was performed on 17 and 18 year olds with no hearing problems to test the validity of this hypothesis. The subjects were asked to rate the quality of three filtrations (highpass, lowpass, and no filtering) of four Harvard Psychoacoustic phonetically balanced sentences. A piezoelectric transducer placed behind the subject’s ear against the mastoid bone was used to transmit the speech. <br><br> The sentences were played in random order, and the subjects were asked to rate each sentence on a 1-5 intelligibility scale. The data were analyzed using Mean Opinion Score and % Good or Better tests, both standards for speech quality subjective testing. The results from these tests indicated that the highpass filter group had the highest speech quality. A Friedman test (2-way rank analysis) was then performed on the data and yielded a p-value of 1.48 x 10-5, which was less than the alpha of 0.05. This showed that the intelligibility ratings for the three filters were significantly different, and the null hypothesis was rejected. In addition, a chi-square test indicated that the subjective testing procedure used in this study was valid for bone conduction analysis. Devices implementing these findings could be used as headphones or hearing aids.<br><br>

IDENTIFICATION OF A GENE INVOLVED IN BREAST CANCER CELL METASTASIS
Tejal Ulhas Naik
The Charter School of Wilmington, Hockessin, DE, USA

Cancer causes death mainly because it metastasizes from the primary site to the secondary sites. I hypothesized that reduced expression of Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), which keeps cells together, in cancer cells may aid to metastasis. To test this hypothesis, I determined the expression of JAM-A in two breast cancer cell lines, a low metastatic T47D and a high metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells using Western blot analysis. I found that the T47D cells expressed five times more JAM-A than the 231 cells. Using Time-Lapse Microscopy, I found an inverse relationship of JAM-A expression to cell migration. Further, JAM-A over-expression of JAM-A in 231 cells resulted in reduced migration and increased clumping. Over-expression of JAM-A also substantially blocked 231-cell invasion through a matrigel, whereas down-regulation of JAM-A using siRNA enhanced T47D cell invasion. Thus, I have identified for the first time JAM-A as a gene whose reduction in expression is responsible for cancer cell metastasis. If loss of JAM-A is due to proteolysis, a diagnostic test could be developed for the early detection of metastatic cancer by testing for JAM-A in the blood. The down-regulation of expression of JAM-A in breast cancer can serve as a prognostic marker in assessing the breast cancer progression. Identification of the SNP that is responsible for malfunctioning of JAM-A can lead to developing a genetic screening test to identify individuals and families with hereditary risk for invasive breast cancer. Finally, therapies could be developed to stop the down-regulation of JAM-A to stop cancer cell metastasis.

MUTAGENIC EFFECT OF TOBACCO ON MICROORGANISMS
Sameem S. Qazi
Carman-Ainsworth High School, Flint, Michigan

In my current science fair project, I wanted to investigate the effects of tobacco on bacteria, which are normal flora in the human body. I selected two organisms, Serratia marcesecens and Micrococcus luteus that are usually harmless to normal healthy people. Normally, Serratia marcesecens produces red color colonies and Micrococcus luteus produces yellow colonies. Therefore, it was easy for me to isolate the mutant colonies for my experiments as they show different colors. I exposed these bacteria to aqueous tobacco extract. Both of the organisms mutated in their morphology and behavior. There was a significant difference between the normal and mutant organisms. The physical appearance of colonies, metabolism of different sugars, and most importantly their susceptability to antimicrobials was remarkably different. The mutant strain of Micrococcus luteus was resistant to all the antimicrobial tested. In contrast, normal Serratia marcesecens was resistant to all the anitmicrobials used and the mutant of the bacteria became susceptible to some of the antimicrobials. There is a strong possibility that normal flora in our body, like the organisms tested in my experiment, can undergo mutation on exposure to tobacco. These mutant bacteria can cause serious infections that are not easily treatable by antimicrobials. This means, healthy people as well as those with many forms of cancer, lung problems, and heart diseases, because of their tobacco use may have increased morbidity and mortality due to resistant bacterial infections.

DESIGNING AN OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE FOR GENETIC TESTING THROUGH TELEMEDICINE
Matthew Edwin Trusheim
Breck School, Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA

Genetic testing is a field that shows great promise in diagnosing diseases. However, genetic tests are expensive and difficult to perform. One solution to this problem is the Optical Waveguide (OWG), which applies a planar waveguide to gel electrophoresis for an inexpensive, easy to use apparatus for genetic testing. While the OWG architecture is capable of reading tube-gels, the gels themselves are inconsistent. The goal of this project was to implement and optimize a self-contained gel casting and running system in order to provide for consistent tube-gel runs. To do this, I adapted a self-contained gel system initially developed by Wulfman, and determined four variables: DNA:dye ratio, dye dilution, voltage, and DNA amount. I modified the Wulfman gel system by fabricating a new gasket, changing the position of the electrodes, and modifying the casting procedure. I found the ideal conditions to be: DNA:dye ratio of 7:3 by volume, dye dilution of 1:1000 by volume, voltage of 150 volts, and DNA load of 35µL. The adapted self-contained gel running and casting system, using the variables I determined, proved to be consistent and easy-to-use. Using this system, the OWG has a distinct possibility of becoming an inexpensive and easy-to-use instrument for providing digital output of genetic tests.

THE USE OF XYLITOL TO PREVENT BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA INFECTIONS IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS
Paul Robert Chakkaphak
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, Florida, U.S.A.

Patients suffering from cystic fibrosis are highly susceptible to infection by two key Gram negative bacteria, Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lung infection with either of these bacteria has very serious consequences, often contributing to the death of these patients at a young age. The purpose of this project was to answer the question, Does xylitol inhibit the adherence of Burkholderia and Pseudomonas to human lung cells? Testing was performed using live human lung fibroblasts growing in cell culture with Eagles Minimal Essential Medium. Lung cells and bacteria were preincubated in 0, 1, 5 and 10% concentrations of xylitol. Bacterial adhesion testing was performed by adding 1.0 ml of the bacterial suspensions to the lung cell cultures. Following a 90-minute incubation at 37C, unattached bacteria were removed from the cells by five cycles of washing with phosphate buffered saline. Washed cells were dried, fixed with methanol and Gram stained. Twenty-five microscopic fields were examined on each slide and the number of attached bacteria were counted in each field. The results of this experiment showed that exposure to even very low concentrations of xylitol inhibited the adherence of Burkholderia and Pseudomonas to human lung cells. After exposure to 10% xylitol the adherence of Burkholderia was reduced by 85% and Pseudomonas adherence was reduced by 79%. In order for Burkholderia and Pseudomonas to cause disease they must first be able to adhere to the cells within the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients. The ability of xylitol to inhibit the adherence of these bacteria to human lung cells could prove to be a major break through in the care of cystic fibrosis patients. Antibiotic therapy is often ineffective and can lead to increased bacterial resistance, however, the use of xylitol, a low cost natural sugar, may help cystic fibrosis patients avoid infections with Burkholderia and Pseudomonas and live longer, healthier lives.<br><br>

THWARTING THE PANDEMIC: TARGETED SOCIAL DISTANCING STRATEGIES
Laura Mcbride Glass
Albuquerque High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States

Threats of an influenza pandemic such as the H5N1 bird flu jumping to humans are mounting. With vaccine or antivirals unavailable when a pandemic hits, what would we do to contain it? I turned to this question with the aid of a networked agent computer model. I made the disease infectivity within the model conform closely to viral shedding data for influenza. I used expert elicitation to define the underlying social contact network on which influenza would spread within a structured community. I considered a small village of 10,000 divided into five age classes: preschoolers, children, teens, adults, and seniors. I gave each age class specific characteristics and grouped them in multiple social groups as defined by my elicitation such as schools, work, and senior meeting groups. Through careful study of the spreading process within simulations, I identified the critical high infectious contact zones within the social contact network centered on the young. I then targeted the age groups of preschoolers, children, and teens to implement social distancing strategies to prevent an influenza pandemic. I found that if schools are closed AND preschoolers, children and teens are restricted to the home, epidemics that would have infected 65% of the population could be reduced by nearly 80%. If adults also restrict their contacts within non essential work environments, epidemics from such highly infective strains can be entirely thwarted! Thus, the oldest of strategies, if properly designed, can prevent a major pandemic from spreading, without the use of vaccine or antivirals.

WONDER BUGS, BACTERIAL ENDOPHYTES, A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF HUMAN INFECTION
Matthew Julian Duenas
Father Duenas Memorial School, Mangilao, Guam, USA

Endophytic bacteria are organisms that live in intercellular spaces of plants that may confer benefits to the plant and can be used for biological control of various plant diseases. There is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance by bacteria harmful to humans. Is there another biological control for these bacteria? I speculate that endophytic bacteria from plants may halp control harmful bacteria to humans.<br><br> First, certain edible leaves found on Guam were pre-washed with sterile water, then surface sterilized with bleach solution. Using aseptic techniques, leaves were plated onto blood and Maconkey agar. All bacterial growths found after 48 hours were isolated and plated onto media with Beta Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. These plates were examined 48 hours later for inhibition of the Beta Streptococcus and Escherichia coli by bacterial endophytes.<br><br> Of the five leaves used, two had no growth on both media, two had growth on the blood agar and not the Maconkey agar, and one had bacterial growth on both media. Gram stain results showed gram positive rods in one leaf, and gram negative rods in two leaves. The endophytes showed no inhibition of Escherichia coli. Only one showed a slight zone of inhibition against Beta Streptococcus and was identified as an enterobacter species.<br><br> Only one bacterial endophyte showed a slight zone of inhibition of the Beta Streptococcus pathogen. There was no evidence of inhibition against the Escherischi coli pathogen. In conclusion, bacterial endophytes may have a role as a biological control for certain harmful bacteria. However, further studies are suggested in order to prove this conclusion entirely true.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE BRAIN ATROPHY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL DETECTIONS OF NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES USING MULTIPLE ANTIBODIES
Richie Kimlong Huynh, Ryan Kimlong Huynh
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, Minnesota, USA

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) could affect eighty-one million people worldwide by 2040. Brain atrophy, the shrinking of brain volume, is apparent in people with AD. Neurofibrillary tangles (tangles) are a pathological hallmark of AD. The purpose of this study was to see whether a correlation existed between brain atrophy and tangles. Four antibody immunostains (MC-1, AT100, AT-8, and Bielschowsky-Silver) were used to detect tangles from frontal cortex tissues of twenty human AD brains, totaling eighty slides. A novel quantitative method for examining tangles was developed. Each slide was prepared with a systematic approach of marking fields for observation using evenly measured string. Averages of tangles were calculated with counts from eight fields per slide. Linear regressions were used to illustrate and test the relationship between brain atrophy and tangles. All four antibody immunostains showed statistically significant correlations using correlation tests: as tangles increase, brain weight decreases. The partial correlation formula was used to control the age variable. AT-8 showed the strongest correlation, followed by Bielschowsky-Silver, AT100, and MC-1. Paired t-tests were used to find differences in the sensitivities of the four antibody immunostains. Bielschowsky-Silver and MC-1 were less sensitive than AT-8 and AT100. Discrepancies in the antibody immunostains are useful information for neuropathologists and scientists studying specific AD brain traits and regions. This study shows that quantification of tangles could prove useful for future research studies and standard comparisons. These results are important for better understanding tangles and AD neurodegeneration and can help diagnostic, pharmaceutical, and research technique advancements.

HONEY: A WEALTH OF HEALTH
Lacey Marie Gravois, Geralyn Schexnayder
Lutcher High School/Science and Math Academy, Lutcher, LA United States 

The purpose of our experiment is to determine whether local honey or non-local honey affects seasonal or non-seasonal allergy symptoms? <br><br>Most allery medications have undesirable side effects and are not "natural" to human consumption and bodily systems. We have heard of several people taking local honey and have few and less seasonal allergy symptoms. Because we know several people in our area who are seasonal allergy sufferers,we thought this would be a good project. <br><br>We had to obtain local harvested honey, and non-local honey. We used local honey becasue we thought that the bees that collected the nectar from our local area would then transfer the pollen to the honey that we consume. Because of this, our allergens fro seasonal allergies would be in the honey. From taking allergy shots, you are actually putting what you are allergic to inside of our bodies that will build up antibodies and immunities to our allergens. We then surveyed several people to determine if they were seasonal or non-seasonal, or no allergy sufferers. We made a questionnaire that would give us more specific information on our subjects. We then categorized our subjects. We gave our subjects particular directions as to what they were to do. Some were given local honey, some store bought honey, and some no honey. After six weeks we collected our data, observed, and charted and graphed our results.

POSTSYNAPTIC NEUROTRANSMITTER BINDING INHIBITION OF "OPPOSITE LEAF SPOT FLOWER" (ACMELLA OPOSI TIFOLIA) FLOWER ISOLATE: A PROSPECT AGENT AGAINST UNCONTROLLED NEURONAL FIRING
Beverly Canoy Casimero, Kenneth Joseph Bureros, John Paul dela Cruz
Bayugan National Comprehensive High School, Bayugan Agusan del Sur, Philippines

This study was conducted to determine the postsynaptic neurotransmitter binding inhibition of “Opposite leaf Spot flower” (Acmella opositifolia) flower crude extract and to find its main components.<br><br> The flowers were sun-dried and ground together with 250 mL analytical grade methanol using a blender. The extract was then subjected to centrifugation and was loaded to the rotary evaporator apparatus to obtain its crude extract. <br><br> Three laboratory toads (Bufo marinus) were used as test organisms. Kymograph with Harris Stimulator was used to mark amplitudes of muscle contraction of the test organisms. Kymograph reading showed that the effect of the “Opposite leaf Spot flower” flower crude extract to the Bufo marinus' lower left thigh prior to the 50% concentration lasted for 30 minutes and the 100% concentration lasted for 60 minutes. The differing amplitudes of muscle contraction on the giant toads’ lower left thighs during the Electrophysiological Assay proved that the extract is a potent anti-epileptic substance as manifested by zero muscular contraction.<br><br> The extract was subjected to Thin Layer Chromatographic analysis, and four (4) components were found. High Performance Liquid Chromatographic analysis revealed that peak number four at 4.55 minutes using Nucleosil 5C18 column was the active component of the extract, which showed postsynaptic neurotransmitter binding inhibition to the test organisms. This manifests that Acmella opositifolia flower crude extract is a potential agent against epileptic attack, a breakthrough in the filed of pharmacological endeavors.<br><br>

NATURE'S SHIELD ROLE OF CYANIDIN AGAINST CELLULAR OXIDATIVE DETERIORATION DUE TO CARCINOGENS
Christopher Jason Lorn, Sishira Mannuru, Nina Ezinne
John B. Connally High School, Austin, Texas, USA

The purpose of experimentation is to understand the protective benefits of cyanidin against peroxidation and oxygen-free radicals due to carcinogenic elements such as formaldehyde by utilizing bacterial tests and controlled exposure. The carcinogen, formaldehyde, inflicts a series of mutations on DNA indirectly by inducing the oxidative deterioration of cellular molecules. Stimulating the cell’s receptiveness to radiation, formaldehyde creates a radiosensitive environment leaving cellular molecules vulnerable to short rays of light, specifically UV-B radiation. Existing in the flavinoid family, cyanidin contains similar traits to carotenoids, such as lutein, that exhibit UV light absorbing activity which can potentially protect against UV light mutations. Experimentation was carried out exposing a concentrated form of cyanidin on Escherichia coli to safely diluted forms of formaldehyde. Data was obtained through the analysis of DNA gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, and survival rates of serial dilutions based on controlled levels of formaldehyde intensity. After the analysis of DNA gel electrophoresis, band distances averaged to deviate from the medium line .4 cm presenting a difference in carcinogen exposed and non-exposed bacterium. Through spectrophotometry, the absorbance rates of cyanidin in an ethanol solution filtered the UV spectrum and leveled off at concentrations of 7x-10x revealing the extent of effectiveness. Survival rates that concluded from serial dilutions showed that bacteria under cyanidin concentrations were, at length, more protected through the increased rates of colonial production. Conclusively, cyanidin could offer wide ranges of protection from detrimental effects of the carcinogens by reducing destruction of cells through peroxidation and UV-light damage.

THE EFFECTS OF GENE SUPPRESSION AND EXPOSURE TO MPTP ON DOPAMINE NEURONS OF C. ELEGANS AS A MODEL FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Marilynn Tedja, Elizabeth Monier, Elise Adcock
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Scientists use model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans to simulate human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder characterized by slowness of movement, rigidity, and tremors caused by dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and consequently, irregular dopamine transport. Scientists can model and study Parkinson’s disease by exposing BZ555 C. elegans, genetically altered to express a green fluorescence protein in dopaminergic neurons, to toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which ablates dopaminergic neurons. The suppression of neuron transmitter-specific genes may help confer resistance to the effects of MPTP, the simulation of Parkinson’s disease.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to effectively suppress cat-4, dat-1, dop-1, and unc-2 using interference RNA (iRNA) in BZ555 C. elegans to determine the effects of gene suppression on longevity, prevent or decrease MPTP induced neuronal degeneration, and propose a method of prevention against Parkinson’s disease. This experiment included four procedures. The first protocol consisted of solution preparations; procedure two involved iRNA induction to suppress targeted genes. The remaining procedures included exposure to MPTP and fluorescence microscopy of dopaminergic neurons and gel analysis of protein production in the RNAi treated nematodes. <br><br> Using the 1.2 mM MPTP treated BZ555 control as the model for Parkinson’s disease, it was determined that the neurons of dat-1 suppressed C. elegans exhibited the worst response to the MPTP treatment, consistently showing dopaminergic neuronal degeneration at all MPTP concentrations in addition to the shortest lifespan. The dop-1 suppressed C. elegans exhibited intact dopaminergic neurons after exposure to the highest concentration of MPTP in addition to the longest lifespan.

ARE NANOPARTICLES TOXIC TO BRAIN CELLS?
Jonathan Wang, Jared Goodman
Oak Hall, Gainesville, Florida, United States

Nanoparticles are molecules that are less than 100 nanometers across. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter or about 10 atoms side-by-side. Nanoparticles are extremely useful as miniature engineering materials and in biomedical applications. We hypothesize that since nanoparticles are so small that they might get into brain cells and become harmful. This experiment was to test the possible cytoxicity of various nanoparticles on cultured rat neuronal cell line pheochromocytoma-12 (PC-12) cells. First, cells were exposed to culture media sonicated with two concentrations of various nanoparticles (carbon black, carbon single-walled nanotubes, C60 fullerenes, cadmium selenide nanoparticles and silica nanospheres). All the cell cultures were placed back inside an oxygenated incubator for 24 hours. After this, a cytotoxicity assay was performed by measuring the amount of a cellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase released by dead or dying cells. The cells were then stained with a chromosome-staining fluorescent dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and viewed under a microscope to examine cell and chromosome morphology. Our results showed that all nanoparticles tested were cytotoxic to some extent, with high concentrations of each nanoparticle more toxic than the lower concentration counterparts. Among them, cadmium selenide and nanotubes are the most cytotoxic. Thus, the hypothesis tested for this experiment was confirmed. When people use nanoparticles to shuttle certain medicines throughout the body, they must be monitored to prevent damage to a person’s brain cells. Also, cautions should be taken whenever nanoparticles are used or handled in order to minimize human exposure to these potentially harmful molecules.

THE CYTOTOXIC IMPLICATIONS OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLE PENETRATION INTO DERMAL FIBROBLAST CELLS
Lauren Amanda Sipzner, Jaimie Stettin
Yeshiva University High School for Girls

Our project explores the potential damage that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can cause to cells, as these minute particles are used in consumer products such as sunscreens and cosmetics. We hypothesize that the particles could penetrate cells and cause damage, which would be heightened with UV light exposure due to titanium dioxide catalyzed organic breakdown. This damage can lead to reduced cell viability. <br><br>Therefore, experiments were conducted on dermal fibroblast cells to test how significantly cellular processes are affected. Cell proliferation, mechanics and structure were examined. Cells of different ages were tested to determine if the limiting capabilities of nanoparticles are related to cell age. Cell migrating capabilities as well as protein production for the extracellular matrix were examined. The addition of antioxidants was tested as a possible solution for preventing the damaging effects of the nanoparticles. <br><br>Results show that nanoparticles can penetrate cells and accumulate within them, leading to cytoskeletal damage. This leads to limitations in cell proliferation, migration, expansion, and extracellular matrix formation. We determined that age plays a significant role in cell sensitivity to nanoparticles. We conclude that titanium dioxide nanoparticles have a limiting effect on cell health. Therefore, further testing must be conducted to determine if titanium dioxide nanoparticles should still be used.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to test if females can identify lower concentrations of scents than males. This experiment was conducted by placing different amounts of water and scents in each jar, and creating different concentration levels. Then the participants were allowed to smell each jar and try to identify the scent. Overall, women ended up recognizing more scents than men. They identified more scents at lower concentration levels than men, as well as scents at medium concentration. However, the men identified more scents than females at the strongest concentration level.<br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SELECTED INGESTED PLASTICIZER ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Jessica Brooke Nagy, Andrea Simons
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, Montana, United States of America

This study was conducted to determine the effects of ingested plasticizers on the growth and development, including mutations and male/female ratios, of fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster. Polyethylene was the type of plastic used. The plastic was cut into small pieces and slow boiled in water for 5 minutes. After cooling, 5 ml of the solution was added to 10 mL of water and 2.4 grams of blue formula 24 and mixed inside a vial. The fruit flies consumed the plasticizer/food mixture for four days and were then crossed using several different cross combinations. Fruit fly mutations, number of offspring produced, and male/female ratios were observed, recorded, and analyzed to determine how ingested plasticizers affect not only the fruit flies directly eating them, but also how their offspring are affected. Statistical significance was then determined using t-Tests. Further data analysis was accomplished by running the data through a statistical analysis program on a supercomputer. Results from these tests illustrated that the plasticizer had a significantly negative effect on several different crosses of Drosophila melanogaster. The affected crosses were the contaminated male/uncontaminated female vials, the uncontaminated male/contaminated female vials, and the contaminated male/contaminated female vials. These vials showed significances when total numbers were compared, as well as when mutations and male/female ratios were compared. This indicates that plasticizers can cause negative effects on the offspring of fruit flies that have consumed the polyethylene compounds.

THE EFFECTS OF GREEN TEA AND TRADITIONAL CHINESE HERBS ON THE INHIBITION OF HMGB1: A NOVEL MEDIATOR OF LETHAL SEPSIS
Charlotte Yum, Xiaotian Chen 
Ossining High School, Ossining and New York, United States 

Despite advances in modern medicine, sepsis remains a prevalent problem among critically ill patients in intensive care units. The high mortality rate of sepsis is in part mediated by bacterial endotoxin, which stimulate macrophages to sequentially release early (e.g., TNF, IL-1, and IFN-ã) and late (e.g., HMGB1) pro-inflammatory cytokines. In light of the recent discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation, a new field of investigation has been initiated for development of experimental therapeutics. This research sets to determine if bacterial endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release can be inhibited by green tea (Camellia sinensis), its main component, Cha Shu and four individual Chinese herbs: Astragalus membranaceus (Huang Qi), Lingusticum wallichii (Huang Qin), Scutellariae baicalensis (Chuan Xiong), and Schisandra chinensis (Wu wei zi). This study indicates that green tea, along with Cha Shu, and an aqueous extract of a Chinese herb, Scutellariae baicalensis dose-dependently attenuated bacterial endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in murine macrophage-like RAW cells. These results suggest that regular intake of green tea and Scutellariae baicalensis may decrease the incidence and mortality rates of lethal sepsis, and that Cha Shu may at least partly be attributed to Green Tea’s attenuating of HMGB1. <br><br>

EXPERIMENTAL RELATION BETWEEN DIETARY INTAKE OF FATTY ACIDS & ONSET OF ASTHMA
Asif Ahsan Ali Jafferani, Asif Surani, Shehzad Mansoor
Aga Khan Higher Secondary School, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE: We experimentally demonstrated the effect of dietary intake of fatty acids and relevant food sources of these nutrients on the clinical manifestations of asthma.<br><br>METHOD: For the experiment we selected an appropriate organism, particularly a chicken, which was easily available. To perform the study, we dissected the organism to expose its respiratory system. The smooth muscles are present in the inner lining of the airway, especially the intrapulmonary as well as extrapulmonary bronchi and bronchioles, but since the major effect of asthma is on smaller airways, hence we were particularly interested in the intrapulmonary respiratory tree. <br><br>Therefore to obtain the specimen, we penetrated the intrapulmonary bronchus, taking its longitudinal section with the help of a thin edged blade and taking the specimen of the smooth muscle. The muscle was stained with Iodine to form a reference slide. The airway was then introduced into a suspension of fatty acids and kept for some time. Another specimen was taken and stained using Iodine. The results were then viewed using a microscope.<br><br>RESULTS: The microscopic view revealed the oedema of the Airway Smooth Muscle cells which thereby contribute to the spasm of the airways, causing breathlessness and this manifests into an asthma attack. This provides sufficient laboratory evidence in support of the concept that airway constriction and onset of asthma are increased by the intake of fatty acids.<br><br>CONCLUSION: This is in agreement with previous epidemiological studies held in this regard & has numerous applications in the upcoming future. <br><br>

Purpose: To explore the etiology and mass distribution of congenital hypothyroidism in infants in Henan province, China. Procedures: Information about 103 Infant patients with congenital hypothyroidism was obtained from 338,000 infants and their parents of Henan province. Clinical significances of growth and treatment in these patients and benefits were investigated. Results: 1) All infants have thyroid glands. The localization, morphism and size of the thyroid glands are normal. It is much different from the last word of authoritative medical textbook. 2) The high incidences of the disease were found in families associated with hypertension, diabetes, dysfunction of thyroid glands, teratogenesis, post-term pregnancy, abortion and environmental pollution during pregnant period. 3) The incidence of the disease is 32.25/100,000 in Henan province; The highest incidence areas include Kaifeng, Zhoukou, Pingdingshan, Xinyang and Luohe cities; the ratio of male vs. female is 1:1.48. 4) The ratio of the costs for screening and therapy vs. benefits is 1:4.69. The infants who received early screening and therapy can obtain normal physique and mentality. Conclusions: 1) The mechanism of congenital hypothyroidism in infants is different from that shown in authoritative medical textbook. 2) Henan is the high incidence area of this disease, which is closely related to high risk factors in family and during pregnant period; male morbidity in Henan is markedly higher than that in China. 3) Early screening and regular therapy are effective steps to prevent the developmental disorders of CH children` physique and mentality. It can bring favorable social/economic benefits.

THE CONTRIBUTION OF THERAPY "X " IN THE PATIENTS OF ALZHEIMER
Vivian F Irlanda, Glorimar Santiago
Sotero Figueroa School, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico

In this research the therapy used, hereby called ¨X¨, is similar to the one used by physicians specialized on Alzheimer. The hypothesis was that, if therapy ¨X¨ positively helps Alzheimer patients then they should be able to remember specific information. Each investigator worked with a female Alzheimer patient, ¨A¨ and ¨B¨. Patient A was 79 years old and patient B was 76 years old. The investigators worked with them every other day during a period of two weeks. The therapy used with the Alzheimer patients focused on helping them to remember information about specific objects that they had previously seen. The selected objects were a hairbrush and a shoe which are items that patients use everyday. The patients were asked questions regarding, where they placed the object and what they used it for. The other part of the therapy was based on asking questions from a questionnaire regarding their daily life, such as the time they usually eat or the time they usually go to bed. Using this approach, it was possible to validate that therapy ¨X¨ is good and effective to help patients to memorize and to remember specific information. This investigation showed that Therapy ¨X¨ had a positive impact on the Alzheimer patients. They were able to repeatedly remember information and data about the objects used in the investigation. The conclusion was that this therapy is effective for Alzheimer´s patients. The methodology that relates questions and objects successfully helped patients to remember information that they previously could not memorize.

THE EFFECTS OF VARIATIONS IN DIETARY FAT INTAKE USING CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS AS A MODEL ORGANISM FOR FAT STORAGE
Erin Nicole D'Agostino, Whitney Quackenbush
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, 11030, US

The latest data from the National Center for Health Statistics shows that thirty percent of American adults are obese. There are many approaches to weight loss; high fat, low fat, high carb diets have all have been popular at some point, but which type of diet affects the amount of fat stored? Rukhun has found several hundreds genes that might regulate fat storage in C. elegans. The nematode is now being used as a model to investigate fat storage. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of fat stored by C. elegans that ingested various amounts of fat in their diet. 6 groups of 50 worms were fed diets of 0, 1, 2, and 3.5 percent fat. Two control groups of wild type and daf 22 maintained on standard nematode growth agar was also studied. Cultures were analyzed for fat storage based on time to starvation and quantification of Sudan Black staining. Experimentation revealed that the highest concentrations of fat in the diet allowed the C. elegans on starvation plates to live six times longer than C. elegans on a low fat diet. Thus supporting the hypothesis that high fat diets cause increased fat storage. Quantitative analysis of Sudan Black staining also supported these findings.

PLASTIC FOOD CONTAINERS: AN UNSAFE SITUATION?
Trisha Lea Schleich, Terra Toribio
Mitchell High School, Mitchell SD, USA

Today's high-speed society often relies on plastics for food preparation and storage. Is this procedure safe at high temperatures? California blackworm segments (Lumbriculus variegatus) were exposed to cooled spring water which had been boiled with plastic samples (those typically used in a home setting). Regenerated head and tail segments were counted at two weeks.<br><br>We expected no difference in rates between controls and the plastics. Our prediction proved wrong. There were significant differences in head segments of the specimens that were exposed to high-density polyethylene (p < 0.00), polyethylene (p = 0.01), mixed plastics (p < 0.00), baby bottles (p < 0.00), and a baby bottle nipple (p < 0.00). The results proved significant with the tail regeneration rates of polyethyleneteraphthalate ( p < 0.00), high-density polyethylene (p < 0.00), polyvinylchloride (p < 0.00), polypropylene (p < 0.00), mixed plastics (p < 0.00), baby bottles (p < 0.00), and baby bottle nipples (p < 0.00). Microwaving the same plastics last year showed the same significant rates in the head segments for high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and the baby bottle. Tail segments showed similar significant patterns with the high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, baby bottle, and the bottle nipple. <br><br>Additional extensions of this study would include individual toxocologic analysis of all possible chemicals used in plastics composition and manufacture (i.e. plasticizers) that could leach into the water. Analysis for genetic mutations as well as neural defects could also be made. <br><br>

OXIDATION OF THE NEURONAL PROTEIN SNAP-25 PROTECTS IT FROM DESTRUCTION BY BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN (BOTOX)
Christina S. Izatt, Elizabeth C. Flores
Timpview High School, Provo, Utah, U.S.A.

<br><br><br><br>Our project focused on the different variants of the SNARE protein SNAP-25 that are found in the human body, and the rate and extent at which the neurotoxin Botulinum Clostridium (Botox) is able to clip (cut) it. This protein is one of the family of SNARE proteins involved in exocytosis. In neurons, exocytosis is the fusion of vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the cell membrane. This leads to the release of neurotransmitters that activate other nerve or muscle cells. We oxidized SNAP-25 using potassium ferricyanide, and reduced it using 2-mercaptoethanol. We then treated SNAP-25 with Botulinum Clostridium type E for time intervals between 0 and 60 minutes. A sample at each time point was pipetted onto polyacrylamide gels. We stained the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye and analyzed the density of the blue color, showing us the amount of the clipped protein. The results revealed that when SNAP-25 was reduced and treated with Botox, it was clipped about 80% and that the oxidized protein was only clipped 20%. These different extents of clipping occurred at the same rate, however, suggesting that Botox cannot clip oxidized SNAP-25. Our findings are significant because this is previously unknown information on the activity of Botulinum Clostridium with SNAP-25 that could form the basis for important pharmaceutical research. <br><br>

HIDAYAH HANIM HISHAM, ROSE MARHAINI ISMAIL, NUR FARAIN RAMDZAN
MARA Junior Science College Serting,Negeri Sembilan,Malaysia

Swamp tea tree or Gelam tree ( Melalueca Cajaputi Powell sp.) commonly found in maggrove swamp is from Mytacea family. The oil from the leaves is used externally by the locals for treatment of rashes and cuts.<br><br>The objective is to study the potential of gelam leaf extract as antivenom for the Monocellate Cobra ( Naja naja Kaouthia sp.)venom. Two phases of studies have been done on the methanol and choloform extract of the leaves.In phase 1,the aortic tissue was horizontally placed into water bath (organ chamber) containing krebs solution at 37°C which is similar to the live condition of the tissue. Air is bubbled through the solution.The tissue placed under tension (1gm weight) and equilibrated for 20 minutes. The result shows muscle contraction of aorta. 50ul gelam leaf extract was added first into the chamber, the tissue shows contraction. Then 25ul venom was added and the result shows tissue relaxation. This proves that gelam extract can block venom induced contraction. A second experiment was done by adding 25ul venom first then 50ul gelam leaves extract. The aorta tissue found to relax. Third experiment, venom was mixed with the gelam leaves extract. This proves that the gelam leaves extract can help in prevent the venom from act to the tissue. This proves that gelam leaves extract can neutralize the toxicity of the venom. The methanol extract is found to be a better solvent. It is also found that 200ul plant extract is the best quantity as antivenom for 25ul venom.<br><br>In phase 2, double immunodiffusion technique is done to determine whether there is interaction between the extract and venom.The result shows interaction between venom and the plant extract by the formation of an immunoprepitation line. This shows that there is significant binding capabilities between gelam’s extract and venom preparation.

THE GROWTH OF PATHOGENIC OR ALLERGENIC FUNGI IN THE COLUMBA LIVIA EXCREMENT (PHASE III)
Legna Figueroa, Darlenne Torres
Natividad Rodriguez Gonzalez School, Arroyo, Puerto Rico

The first phases of the investigation proved that the exposure to pigeon’s (Columba livia) excrement affects the respiratory tract. The hypothesis for the third phase was: pigeon droppings serve as a medium for the growth of allergenic fungi that could cause hypersensitivity reaction in individuals who suffer asthma, rhinitis, or sinusitis. Contaminated schools from a school district were identified, and it was found that 67% of them were in urban settings, while 20% in rural areas. Health statistics indicated a very high incidence of respiratory conditions among students in these schools.<br><br> Three contaminated schools were chosen (one from each educational level) and the samples taken from them were analyzed on the following culture media:<br><br>•Malt Extract Agar: use for the growth of most fungi (not a selective medium).<br><br> Result: confluent growth on all three samples (too many to count: TMTC).<br><br>•Niger Seed Agar: use for the isolation of the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans.<br><br> Result: the yeast was not isolated from any of the three samples.<br><br>•GN25: use for the isolation of xerophilic (able to grow in the absence of humidity) fungi.<br><br> Results: sample #1 and #2 demontrated confluent growth, but Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium spp, and Rhodotorula spp. (environmental yeast) were noticed. Sample #3, dilution 0.001 had the following fungal census: 76.27% Wallemia sp. (90/118), 14.41% Cladosporium sp. (17/118), Aspergillus sp. 9.32% (11/118).<br><br> Interviews with some health specialists evidenced the importance of this research because there’s not much investigation about the relationship between xerophilic fungi and allergies. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF PLASTICIZER DEHP ON REPRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS
Sameer Gorav Gupta, Brice Alfred Bongiovanni
Central High School, Macon, Ga, USA

This study analyzes the effects of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer commonly used to make PVC more flexible and durable, on reproductive fitness and reproduction measured by progeny viability and fertility, respectively. Using Drosophila melanogaster as the experimental model, the number of offspring and the number of eggs laid were determined when adults and larvae were raised on medium containing the phthalate. Drosophila progeny raised on mediums made from four different dilutions of DEHP (ranging from 1:50,000 to 1:1 billion) were compared to the number of Drosophila progeny raised on control medium. F1 and F2 progeny were analyzed and represented over 20,000 offspring. Data were collected for each dilution by gender. Egg-laying experiments were conducted to determine differences in the number of larvae raised on DEHP when compared to controls. Each experiment used a male or female raised on DEHP and a normal male or female. Over 5,000 eggs laid on a smooth medium were counted. <br><br>Statistical analyses were performed to determine the effects of phthalate in each experiment. DEHP had little effect on progeny counts, whereas it caused a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. These results demonstrate DEHP-treated F1 larvae and the F2 offspring of these matured larvae are equally viable as controls at eclosion. However, the fertility of DEHP-treated parentals is reduced suggesting the viability of eggs from DEHP-treated parentals is greater. These data support a complex interaction of genes and the need for more analyses of how specific genes cause the effects observed.<br><br>

USE 'EM AND ABUSE EM': THE FEEDING RITUALS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS
Elaine Christine Owen, Shannon Thorp
St. Andrew's Priory School Honolulu, Hawaii U.S.A

Our project, "Use ‘Em and Abuse ‘Em: The Feeding Rituals of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis", investigates which nutrients are metabolized by P. aeruginosa in the lung surfactant of Cystic Fibrosis patients, allowing the bacterium to thrive and grow to high cell densities. This infection eventually kills the patient. We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa most likely metabolizes phosphatidylcholine because it is a major component of lung surfactant, which coats the otherwise nutrient poor environment of the lung. We tested our hypothesis by mutating the genes that we believe are responsible for choline and glycerol degradation. Our results supported our hypothesis, stating that genes betAB and glpD appear to be responsible for the degradation of glycerol and choline respectively. <br><br>

TISSUE INFLAMMATION AND CYTOKINE EXPRESSION DURING YERSINIA PESTIS PNEUMONIA
Andrew John Lechner, Lin Chen
Parkway Central High, Chesterfield MO, USA

This project will measure tissue injury and pro-inflammatory mediator expression during infection of rodents with an attenuated strain of Yersinia pestis. To model airborne infection, male rats will be infected intratracheally with specified inocula of Y. pestis strain KIM6+. Progression to shock and lung failure will be assessed by monitoring their aortic blood pressure, pulse, and blood O2 and CO2 pressures for up to 72 hours in a Biosafety Level-2 laboratory. The hypothesis says bacteria from the lungs will spread to other critical organs to infect and inflame them, notably the liver and spleen. The spread of infection to these organs will be quantified by counting bacterial colony forming units (cfu); tissues will be homogenized in sterile buffer, diluted, and plated on agar at 37 Degrees Celsius. After 48 hours of incubation, the KIM6+ cfu on the plates will be counted. Tissue inflammation will be assessed in three ways. First, fresh segments of infected tissues for cytokine analyses will be homogenized in sterile buffer and centrifuged to produce supernatants for rat-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Second, other fresh tissue segments will be weighed and then dried at 70 Degrees Celsius to determine their wet/dry ratios. Third, other tissue segments will be fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained to identify and count polymorpho-neutrophils. <br><br> Our results confirm our hypothesis that Y. pestis spread throughout the host and subsequently infected the major organs. Our data of cytokine concentrations (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), increasing cfu counts, and increasing PMN numbers all supported the spread of infection.<br><br>

A STUDY OF KAPOSI'S SARCOMA HERPES VIRUS IN HUMAN B CELLS
Evangelia Athanasoula, Thomai Gastopoulos
Central High School, Philadelphia PA, United States 

This project was conducted in order to determine the specific cellular genes that are regulated when the Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA), expressed by Kaposi’s Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV), is evident in Human B Cells. LANA is assumed to affect the tumor suppressor genes p53 and pRb and the cell cycle genes p21 and E2F. From the background research that was conducted, it was hypothesized that LANA induces modifications of these genes, promoting oncogenesis. <br><br> Two cell lines were used. One of the cell lines contained the Red Fluorescence Protein (RFP) as a control and the other contained RFP and LANA. RNA was extracted from both cell lines. mRNA probes were made through Fist-Strand cDNA synthesis and DNA was then prepared through reverse transcription. Polymerase Chain Reactions were performed to amplify the genes of interest and to determine their changes in the presence and absence of LANA. Western Blots were performed to determine the changes in the protein level due to the modifications of the genes. Immunofluorescence was executed to determine cellular localizations and changes in signals due to the expression of LANA. <br><br> The results of the PCR showed that fewer genes were amplified in cells containing LANA. The results of the immunofluorescence demonstrated that in LANA positive cells that contained LANA, the specific genes that were probed for with their corresponding antibodies were less expressed in LANA positive cells than in LANA negative cells. It was concluded that LANA modifies the specific genes p53, pRb, p21, and E2F, promoting oncogenesis. <br><br>

Melastoma sp. has been used extensively as a traditional remedy for kidney stones disease. The main objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of the plants’ methanol extracts to inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals (kidney stones) in-vitro as well as getting the chromatograph profiles of the methanol extracts.<br><br> Profiles of methanol extract of root and branch of Melastoma imbricatum Wall and root of Melastoma malabathricum were obtained using the Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) with chloroform:methanol (9:1) as the mobile phase, UV–Visible Spectroscopy (UV) and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) tests. Results from the TLC tests and UV graphs showed that all the methanol extracts contain flavonoid. The highest peak in the FTIR graph from the root methanol extract of Melastoma imbricatum Wall at wavelength 1776 – 1557 cm-1, showed that it contains the highest amount of flavonoid.<br><br> An experiment between ammonium oxalate and calcium chloride that forms calcium oxalate crystals was conducted to study the anti-urolithiasis effect with sodium citrate as “control”. It showed that the root extract of Melastoma imbricatum Wall has the highest inhibition index compared to the other extracts. <br><br> In conclusion, the root methanol extract of Melastoma imbricatum Wall contains the highest amount of flavonoid and has the highest inhibition index of calcium oxalate crystal growth in-vitro. Future study should be conducted to evaluate the ability of the above extract to inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals in-vivo.<br><br>

DYSTROPHIC SKELETAL MUSCLE CELL MEMBRANES PATCHED BY POLOXAMER 407
Michael McCord Polmear, Lalith Polepeddi
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village CO 80111, USA

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating disease distinguished by rapid muscle degeneration. There is no known cure for muscular dystrophy. Current steroid treatments cause adverse physiological side effects. Here we show that the biocompatible polymer poloxamer 407 patches muscle membrane perforations, thus reestablishing membrane integrity. In vivo administration of poloxamer 407 to dystrophic mice improved membrane stability as witnessed by significant drops in blood creatine kinase levels. Once details concerning optimal dose and regimen are exacted, poloxamer 407 could represent a new therapeutic treatment for dystrophic skeletal muscle.

A HYBRID REACTION-DIFFUSION CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL OF GLIOBLASTOMA
Hersh Vivek Goel, Michael Fan, Corina Oprescu
Gilbert High School, Gilbert, Arizona, U.S.A.

We present an improvement upon the current hybrid reaction-diffusion cellular automata (CA) model, by changing the current Mass Action model (linear relationship between nutrient availability and nutrient uptake) representing reaction-diffusion into a Michaelis-Menten model (rectangular hyperbolic relationship). We designed a cellular automata grid bounded by blood vessels. As nutrients diffuse from the blood vessels to the grid interior, the cells absorb nutrients and take random actions. The stochastic nature of our model is contingent upon the probabilities defining cellular actions (necrosis, mitosis, migration). These probabilities are based on specific parameters (nutrient availability and tumor cell crowding out effect) and are interrelated (the probabilities of the three actions add up to one). By running this program through MATLAB, we generated graphs of nutrient profiles, and tumor populations. After analyzing the various graphs of Mass Action CA Model (current) and Michaelis-Menten CA Model (our improvement) we determined that our improvement significantly enhances the biological accuracy of tumor cell development.

PRODUCTION OF A MURINE MODEL OF DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
Shivani Bharat Parikh
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, Florida, U.S.A.

Currently, no proper animal research model exists to study diabetic nephropathy (DN), a disease that is present in one-third of type 1 diabetics and characterized by excessive protein loss in the urine that ultimately leads to renal failure. The purpose of this study was to generate a mouse model that spontaneously develops DN by introducing a genetic deficiency in eNOS, a molecule that prevents the onset of type 1 diabetes, onto a standard model of type 1 diabetes, the NOD mouse. A backcross progeny was then produced by backcrossing (NOD x B6.129.NOS3-/-) the F1 generation of the previous breeding onto the original NOD model. The litters were tested for diabetes-specific genetic markers to confirm existence of type I diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. <br><br> Of the 55 mice tested, 50% were NOD homozygous for the tested primers, indicating sufficient generation of the hybrid mouse. Statistical analysis revealed that the novel hybrid strain was significantly more likely to spontaneously develop diabetic nephropathy than its parents. One mouse with >70% of markers homozygous for eNOS deficiency was selected as a breeder for further backcrossing to NOD. <br><br> The offspring of the former cross will be taken through the aforementioned procedure to generate NOD/B6.129 mice, with urine and blood of the mice being collected prior to euthanasia (by principle investigator). Histology will then be performed to examine organs and tissue for signs of diabetic nephropathy. The new knockout generation will allow the study of the abnormal blood glucose levels and protein loss that occur during DN within a singular strain of mouse, a major step towards generating and testing a therapeutic remedy for the disease.<br><br>

CHOLANGIOCARCINOMAS OF PUTATIVE STEM CELL ORIGIN EXPRESSES THE RECEPTOR KINASE PROTEIN ERBB-2/N EXPRESSES THE RECEPTOR KINASE PROTEIN ERBB-2/NEU.
Raheen Rashard Bush
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

According to the American Cancer society, liver cancer affects thousands of people throughout the world, predominantly in developing third world countries. With its high mortality rate, this insidious cancer has only limited treatments. Liver carcinogensis has been under debate for several decades. Recent studies have indicated that the receptor kinase protein ErbB-2 is over expressed in the molecular pathogenesis of Cholangiocarcinomas. The purpose of this project is to determine whether or not the oval cells “liver stem cells” develop into liver cancer cells. Oval cells have a bipotential phenotype-giving rise to both hepatocyctes and cholangiocytes. A putative transformed cholangiocytes cell line was developed from hepatic oval cells, and it was hypothesized that these cells will express markers associated with Cholangiocarcinomas. Since the student researcher had no contact with live animals, tissue samples from rats were given to this researcher, which were administered with 2-acetaminofluorene, which inhibits hepatocyte proliferation. Partial Hepatectomy was performed following the administration of the carcinogen Aflatoxin B1. The researcher was then given the tissue removed to perform Immunohistochemical staining, which was used in a diagnosis of the presence of cancer. The experiment confirmed the hypothesis, which stated that ErbB-2 in the cells was indicative of Cholangiocarcinomas. The experimental data helped to verify the formation of liver carcinomas. The research results also suggest that the oval cells “liver stem cells” may give rise to liver cancer in the presence of a carcinogen. This research will also allow scientist to study the inhibition of oval cells proliferation during regeneration.

COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTION OF GENES IN THE HUMAN GENOME USING NUCLEOTIDE COMPOSITION
Amy Tai
Jenks High School, Jenks, OK, USA

Identification of human genes is only a preliminary step to understanding the depth of the human genome. Some current detection methods include determination of transcriptions start sites (TSSs) and algorithms utilizing evolutionary footprints and gene structure. I offer the comparison of two simple methods of gene prediction utilizing only the compositions of A, C, G, and T in the presented genomic segment. 100 random human genomic segments were chosen and tested using Chargaff’s Second Parity Rule and AT vs. CG composition. For the first prediction method, genes were determined as segments with |T-A| within 2~3% of |C-G|. For the second, genes were determined as segments with (C+G)>(A+T). A segment was either genic or intergenic. I found that the AT vs. CG prediction method had a higher predictive ability than the Chargaff method. However, its prediction accuracy was relatively limited and did not satisfy the 75% boundary of significance. Still, further work may improve the accuracy of the AT vs. CG method or other simple methods for gene prediction, allowing for their more widespread use.

EFFECTS OF HER2 EXPRESSION ON CHEMOTHERAPY SENSITIVITY IN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Zhenhuan Lei
Westview High School, Portland, OR, USA

Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another, which can often be fatal. Breast cancer is one of the most likely of all cancers to metastasize, with an occurrence rate of 10-16%. One of the predictive markers for whether a breast cancer will metastasize and how aggressive the metastases will be is the level of expression of Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in the tumor. This study sought to link HER2 expression level in breast cancer cells with treatment efficacy. The cellular toxicity of the chemotherapy agents carboplatin and doxorubicin, and the anti-HER2 targeted antibody Herceptin, was assessed in human breast cancer cells MB-MDA-231BR which expressed low or high levels of HER2. Dose response tests were done with cell viability assays, initially to find the ~50% toxicity dose, and then to compare responses between the two cell lines. Immunocytochemistry was done to see expression of apoptosis proteins in individual cells. Western blots were done on protein extracts from the low and high HER2 expressing cells. The level of HER2 expression was determined and the apoptotic response to different doses of the different drugs was compared between cell lines. The results show that there appears to be no difference between efficacy of the drugs on the cell lines. These results indicate that HER2 level did not affect chemotherapy toxicity. Even though there was a large difference in HER2 levels between the two cell lines, there was no apparent difference in the toxicity to Herceptin. These results suggest that even the low level of HER2 in the low expressor cells was sufficient for Herceptin efficacy. These dose response and toxicity tests will provide preliminary data for a clinical trial of chemotherapy with Herceptin in patients with breast cancer metastases to the brain.

DEVICE FOR SPEECH IMPAIRED AND DEAF (D-S.I.D) LIFE CHANGING COMMUNICATION (AN ALTERNATIVE TO SIGN LANGUAGE)
Fatima Shami
Headstart School Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan

Non-hearing people are significant in number and are an important part of our society. These people remain isolated from the community due to lack of proper means of communication with hearing people. Sign language is their main means of communication, which is not properly understood by hearing people. Communication is the best way for integration of these people into the society. Devices that have been built earlier do not fulfill all their needs at a time. Moreover they are expensive, slow and not handy. D-S.I.D (Device for Speech Impaired and Deaf) is made to counter their problems in communication with normal people as an alternative to sign language. There by it is called a life changing communication. Software program has been developed and loaded on mobile phone, which is cheaper, commonly available and as per survey can be used by speech impaired and deaf people. This device offers comprehensive facility including text note pad, text to pictures, text to vibration and text to speech for interaction. This device as is on mobile also facilitates short message service (SMS). This device was tested on a group of speech impaired and deaf people. The results show positive response and acceptability of this device from deaf and speech impaired people being alternative to sign language, compatible with their abilities, handy, light, cost effective and manageable.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL APPROACH FOR APPLICATIONS IN PREIMPLANTATION GENETIC DIAGNOSIS OF DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY
Amelia Nong Shin Chang
Raffles Junior College, Singapore, SINGAPORE

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a fatal X-linked recessive inherited disease which arises due to mutations in the dystrophin gene, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and culminating in death. Prognosis for afflicted individuals remains poor, especially since a successful cure has not emerged, leaving molecular analysis as the only solution available for couples at risk of conceiving afflicted children.<br><br>One widely-used technique to exclude the presence of an affected foetus is prenatal diagnosis. Another alternative for the management of this disease is preimplantation genetic diagnosis, where analysis is carried out on single blastomeres biopsied from cleavage stage embryos, hence avoiding the need for pregnancy termination. However, only one or two cells can be removed at maximum to maintain embryonic integrity. Taking into consideration that a single diploid cell only contains about 5pg of DNA, successful genetic diagnosis is hindered by limiting template and additionally complicated by the prevalence of haploid blastomeres. <br><br>This study aims to develop a novel amplification approach for the enhancement of diagnostic sensitivity, in order to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis arising as a result of limiting template DNA. Results from the novel protocol encompassing both multiplex nested PCR and whole genome amplification have demonstrated successful analysis of DNA from starting amounts between 0.01 to 1pg, lower than that found in a single blastomere. This strategy has shown promise in improving amplification sensitivity beyond single cell limits for the amelioration of prenatal diagnostic quality and minimization of embryo mistyping during PGD, and is applicable in a clinical context.

PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PRIMARY DRUG RESISTANCE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV INFECTION
Brian E Clement
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs FL, United States

The emergence of HIV drug resistance now presents the greatest threat to the success and sustainability of affordable first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). The purpose of this project was to analyze data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Project One study on “Finding and Characterizing Persons with Recent and Newly Diagnosed HIV Infection” in order to: 1) determine the overall prevalence of primary drug resistance among persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection that were ART naïve, 2) characterize demographics and risk behaviors of persons with primary drug resistance, and 3) determine the prevalence of specific point mutations known to confer resistance to available antiretroviral drugs.<br><br> Secondary genotypic data was inputted into the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database in order to determine the overall prevalence of drug resistance. Out of 538 ART naïve participants in the study, 85 of them (15.8%) were shown to have drug resistance.<br><br> SAS was used in order to perform Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests comparing race, age, sex, high risk heterosexual behavior, injection drug use, and men who have sex with men to resistance (overall resistance, resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and all first line drugs). Injection drug use was found to have an increased likelihood of resistance to Efavirenz and Nevirapine. No other statistically significant relationships were present.<br><br>

MITIGATION OF INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER: REDUCTION OF VEGF-ASSOCIATED TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS WITH OLEIC ACID
Chloe Julia Cundal
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY, USA

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed type of cancer and the second leading cause of death among women. It is estimated that three million women are living with breast cancer, two million have been diagnosed, and one million are not aware they have it. VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is a protein associated with angiogenesis. Excess amounts of VEGF frequently lead to tumor formation. Oleic Acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid found in olive oil. Research is indicating Oleic Acid can reduce the risk of breast cancer. This research will investigate the link between the positive effects of Oleic Acid and VEGF levels within the cell, possibly indicating a mechanism by which Oleic Acid reduces rates of tumor production in breast cancer. Before experimentation, 6.12 cells were obtained from ATCC. These cells were chosen because they express the protein VEGF. Cells were processed using standard ICC techniques. Primary VEGF antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After secondary staining, cells were evaluated using digital microscopy and density slice software. After experimentation was complete, averages of the eight slides were calculated. The control slide was found to have an average of 13 VEGF expressions. The 25% slide had an average of 21.17 VEGF expression counts with raw averages ranging from 15 to 25. The 100% slide resulted in an average of 2.3 VEGF expression counts, the lowest slide average. The 150% recommended daily intake slide was found to have an average VEGF expression count of 4.5. It was obvious Oleic Acid can impact the production of VEGF in cells. Concentrations below 100% RDA caused an increase in VEGF production. However, those values at or above 100% significantly decreased VEGF formation. <br><br>

EVOLUTIONARY PATTERN IN INFLUENZA A HEMAGGLUTININ AND NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEINS
Kevin Kyle Hawkins
GlenOak High School. Canton, Ohio, United States

A rapidly and randomly replicating virus, influenza is composed of eight negative sense RNA segments and two surface glycoproteins. Bioinformatics and computing were used to investigate evolutionary relationships in 200 sequences of human influenza virus in segment four hemagglutinin (HA) and eight nonstructural proteins from the influenza sequence database (http://www.flu.lanl.gov). Data was grouped by protein and subtypes; then analyzed with San Diego Supercomputer programs (CLUSTALW, CLUSTALDIS, PROTDIST) to align sequences and calculate evolutionary distance using the Percent Accepted Mutation Model. Calculated distances were analyzed for patterns and relationships using the neighbor joining method and scatter plots. Tertiary structures were analyzed for residues critical in the protein’s functional region. Phylogenetic branch lengths were small and cluster in one area when virulent strains were compared, branch lengths were larger and two clusters formed when comparing virulent to non-virulent strains, suggesting a relationship between HA protein and virus virulence. Scatter plots suggest that certain residues are conserved during influenza evolution such as a common preserved structure in tryptophan’s double carbon ring. The HA protein contains a previously unknown site (292) which contributes to virus virulence if it contains an asparagine (non-virulent strains typically contain aspartic acid). Statistical analysis supports site 292 significance and suggests that some proteins have more critical roles in producing a pandemic strain (Z-proportionality test: p<.01). The next step is to isolate regions of the proteins critical in virulence to facilitate drug development and identify conserved and variable regions of viral proteins allowing more efficient vaccination selections.

CHARACTERIZING NOVEL PROTEIN TRAFFICKING PATHWAYS IN THE MALARIA PARASITE
Avanthi Raghavan
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Florida, USA

Critical to the pathogenicity of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the malaria disease, is its mechanisms of protein transport. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the Plasmodial SNARE protein homologues, PfSec22 and PfBet1, in the unusual protein trafficking mechanisms of P. falciparum. <br><br> Expression of the putative computer-identified PfSec22 and PfBet1 genes within the parasite was verified through RT-PCR, and the genes were cloned into bacterial expression vectors. Complementary polyclonal antibodies produced against the recombinant PfSec22 protein were used in a Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions isolated from the infected erythrocyte and an immunofluorescence assay with fixed parasites. Transfection studies were undertaken with both PfSec22 and PfBet1; the genes were subcloned into a GFP transfection vector, and GFP fluorescence within the parasite was monitored through confocal microscopy. <br><br> Western blot analysis reveals that PfSec22 is expressed throughout the life cycle of the parasite and is found exclusively in membranes, verifying its function as a SNARE protein involved in vesicular fusion and docking. Immunofluorescence assays tentatively confirm PfSec22 expression within the erythrocyte cytosol, suggesting that the parasite exports its protein synthesizing machinery beyond its own plasma membrane. Transfection data reveal that PfSec22 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and parasitophorous vacuole membrane; alternatively, PfBet1 is localized to the tubovesicular network and erythrocyte plasma membrane. Understanding protein trafficking in P. falciparum will allow for subsequent synthesis of novel therapeutic agents targeting these pathways. <br><br>

PHARMACOGENOMICS IN COLORECTAL CANCER TREATMENT-UGT1A1 POLYMORPHISM
Douglas Scott Crawford
Airline High School, Bossier City, LA, United States

Irinotecan (CPT-11, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-(piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonylcamptothecin, Captosar R) labeling was recently updated to include dosing recommendations based on a patient’s UGT1A1 status, since it has been estimated that 10% of the United States population carry homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme. Our objective was to identify the prevalence of UGT1A1 SNPs in our colorectal cancer patient population. In a pilot study, 55 individuals with colorectal cancer were identified and recruited from the patients at a designated research instituion. Peripheral blood was drawn from consenting patients and using automated molecular chip technology (AutoGenomics), extracted genomic DNA was screened for unique genetic sequences in the UGT1A1 gene. Strikingly, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) were found to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Heterozygote genotypes were found in 21 of the 55 (38%). We hypothesize that the prevalence of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism in colorectal cancer patients in Shreveport, LA may exceed polymorphism occurrence currently reported in recent literature, suggesting incorporation of inter-individualized treatment based on genotype status. Continued patient recruitment and further clinical correlations will be assessed in order to determine the relevance of polymorphism frequency in our patient population.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CHROMOSOMES REARRANGEMENT IN CLONES SURVIVING IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE
Danna Elisabeth Thomas
Broadneck Senior High School, Annapolis Maryland, U.S.A

Chromosomal destabilization is one endpoint of genomic instability, thought as an early step in carcinogenesis. Radiation-induced genomic instability can result in gene mutation and amplification, chromosome rearrangements, and cell death. These changes are induced directly by irradiation as well as indirectly in progeny of irradiated cells or nearby unirradiated bystander cells. I previously demonstrated chromosomal instability in cells several generations after irradiation and from the bystander effect (BSE), also.<br><br> To understand potential relationships between chromosomal destabilization and other endpoints of genomic instability, I examined established populations of cells originating from single cells (clones) that survived 5 Gy of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation or 10 Gy of low LET X-rays hundreds of cell cycles post-irradiation. Building on my previous observations, I evaluated these clones for sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations, testing the hypotheses that radiation-induced genomic instability phenotype persists over long periods of time and that the degree of instability might change over time.<br><br> My results supported the hypothesis that radiation initiates events mediating ongoing chromosome destabilization years after exposure. The chromosomal instability phenotype remained the same as that observed years ago, but results based on SCEs has changed, indicating chromosomal instability and chromatid effects may have different mechanisms. While these mechanisms are unknown, my results suggest further study is appropriate to determine long-term risk associated with radiation exposure. My results apply to individuals surviving exposure to radiation in space, nuclear accidents, terrorist events, or clinical treatments and their possible risk for increased genomic instability or cancer. <br><br>

DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR -2 (VEGFR-2) DURING PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION
Martha Nicole Couch
Broadneck High School, Annapolis, Maryland, United States of America

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, a key step in tumor metastases. The most prominent activator of angiogenesis is Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor -2 (VEGFR-2), initiating a signaling cascade within the individual cell that leads to angiogenesis. Recent studies have produced contradictory information regarding the expression of VEGFR-2 by prostate cancer cells. This conflicting data may indicate one of three things: cell lines are different than actual prostate cancer cells; metastatic cells selectively express VEGFR-2 or there is not enough data. Due to these incongruities, we hypothesized that the expression of VEGFR-2 is directly related to the malignant potential of the tumor from which the prostate cancer cell line was derived. In order to test the selective expression of VEGFR-2, we ran a series of Western blots from the prostate cell lines LNCaP, DU145, 22Rv1, PC3 and PC3M. The results showed that the VEGFR-2 protein was not detected by Western analysis in any of these cell lines. Since the results neither support nor refute the hypothesis, further studies need to be conducted. To test for degradation of the target protein at the time of the Western analysis, this experiment can be repeated. To test the ambiguity highlighted in the two studies, patient samples and cell lines should be tested by Western blot to analyze the possible differences between the two. Analysis of the mRNA of each cell line via RT-PCR may be done to analyze the potential for expression.

GENOMIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE GERM-LINE ORIGIN OF HUMAN BIRTH DEFECTS: A SIMULATION STUDY
Daniel Zheng
Saint Paul Academy and Summit School, Saint Paul MN, United States

Deleterious germ-line mutations are an underappreciated cause of human birth defects because there is no reliable method to measure its impact as either the sole or contributing etiological factor in most birth defects. In this project, I studied the feasibility of using neutral marker mutations to determine if a birth defect affecting a pair of siblings originates from a deleterious germ-line mutation. A computer model of germ cell proliferation was created to investigate the relationship between the two types of mutation events (deleterious germ-line mutation versus neutral marker mutation). The program tracked four random variables: 1) the number of germ cells that are completely normal, 2) the number of germ cells that only carry a deleterious mutation, 3) the number of germ cells that only carry a marker mutation, and 4) the number of cells that carry both the deleterious mutation and the marker mutation. The simulated values of the four random variables allowed me to estimate the probability that a marker mutation, already detected in one diseased child, will re-appear in the second diseased child. The results showed that, if the birth defect is due to a deleterious germ-line mutation, the probability that the marker mutation recurs in the second child is about 10-15%. If the birth defect is due to other causes however, the probability that the marker mutation recurs in the second child is only about 5%. This level of probability difference is detectable with clinical studies. The simulation-based calculations indicate that it is feasible to use genomic technology to identify if a human birth defect originates in the germ-line.

THREE NOVEL ANTI-CANER AGENTS AND THEIR EFFICACY ON LEUKEMIA B CELLS
Ummul-Kiram Kathawalla
The Blake Upper School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA

This year 35,000 new cases of leukemia will be diagnosed in the United States. Leukemia is cancer of the bone marrow and blood, and current treatment is often limited to chemotherapy, radiation, marrow transplantation, or immunotherapy. A new anti-cancer agent, known as DT2219 EA, has been created at a research institution. Two toxins have been created from the original DT2219 EA; they are known as DT2219 EB1 and DT2219 Arl. DT2219 is made from truncated diphtheria toxin and the sFvâ€™s (the smallest binding portion of an antibody) of CD22 and CD19. DT2219 Arl differs from EA because Arl, a stabilizing agent, was added, and the sFv locations are varied. In order to prove the efficacy of Arl, proliferation assays were completed. A proliferation assay tests the effectiveness of the toxin at varied concentrations on assays of B leukemia cells. One proliferation assay between Bic 3 (a control that targets T cells) and Arl highlighted Arlâ€™s potent abilities. The second proliferation assay among DT2219 EA, EB1 and Arl revealed the three toxinsâ€™ ability to kill cancer cells. To understand if the three toxinsâ€™ potency was because of their ability to bind specifically, a blocking assay was completed. The blocking assay revealed the toxinsâ€™ ability to kill specifically by adding antibodies, therefore not allowing the toxin to bind to the cells. In summary, all three derivatives of DT2219 were effective, demonstrating their potential in treating and curing cancer.

THE INFLUENCE OF EYE PIGMENTATION ON THE MANDELBAUM EFFECT
Carsten David Proehl
Glencoe Silver Lake High School, Glencoe, Mn. United States

The Mandelbaum Effect(dark focus)is a visual response to an<br><br>“interfering” object, such as a screen, in focusing on a far object. <br><br> This researcher questioned whether eye pigmentation had an influence on this dark focus distance. A “rolling screen” apparatus was used to test this dark focus. <br><br> Over 200 high school students were tested and eye color noted. <br><br>The testing consisted of the subject sitting at the end of a long stationary table, while resting their head with their hands-elbows on the table. They were to look through a rolling screen apparatus at a non-excitatory word that was set about 20 feet away. The screen apparatus was slowly moved away from the subject until the non-excitatory word became blurry. The distance was measured between the subjects eyes and edge of the screen apparatus.<br><br> Overall it would appear when taking the average eye color distance, brown eye distance was superior to the rest. In comparing males to females, males eyes had further dark focus distance in all eye colors. <br><br> The implication of this data would infer that male, brown-eyed subjects had the farthest dark focus. This is something that the military and airports should and has considered in determining those better suited for tasks such as landing a plane or steering a ship.<br><br>

FRACTAL DIMENSION OF FETAL MONITOR TRACINGS: COMPARISON OF GOOD VERSUS POOR BEAT-TO-BEAT VARIABILITY
Connor Gordon Mulcahy
Whitewater High School, Whitewater, Wisconsin, USA

<br><br> <br><br> This experiment was designed to compare the difference in fractal dimension of fetal heart rate tracings in areas of good versus poor beat-to-beat variability. Although beat-to-beat variability is considered important in determining fetal well-being, currently, determination of the quality of beat-to-beat variability is relatively subjective. The goal of this project was to demonstrate that fractal dimension could be a useful quantitative measurement of beat-to-beat variability.<br><br> Fetal heart rate tracings were obtained from an on-line case library containing nonidentifiable patient data. Areas of good and poor beat-to-beat variability were identified on the tracings and confirmed with two physicians. Fractal dimension of a set length of each selected area was measured using a computer program which utilized a box counting method for determining fractal dimension. The resulting data was compared using a spreadsheet program. <br><br> The results indicated that there was a demonstrable difference in fractal dimension between areas of good and poor beat-to-beat variability on fetal monitor tracings. The average fractal dimension of good beat-to-beat variability areas was 12.254% ± 2.505% higher than that of poor beat-to-beat variability areas. In no area of poor beat-to-beat variability was the fractal dimension higher than in any area of good variability.<br><br> The results of this experiment suggest that in the future fetal monitors could use fractal dimension of fetal heart rate tracings as a more objective method of warning the physician of the presence of a potential indication of fetal distress, poor beat-to-beat variability. <br><br>

THE ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS OF ECHINACEA PURPUREA ON MDCK CELLS
Emily Danielle Reinbold
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake SD, USA

The purpose of this study was to examine three questions on how Echincea Purpurea affects a cell primarily to help fight off the Influenza A Miami Virus. The three questions being studied are: Does Echinacea Purpurea directly affect cells? Is Echinacea Purpurea's effect on cells enough to stop infection? Does Echinacea Purpurea prevent hemmaglutination of cells?<br><br>For this study two different forms of Echinacea were used, a purchased tincture and a tincture prepared out of the dry form of Echinacea. These two forms and the vehicle used to change the dry Echinacea into tincture were used to pretreat MDCK cells. The cells were used for gel electrophoresis. A hemmaglutination experiment was carried out. A hemagglutination test was performed to determine the correct amount of Influenza A virus to use. Chicken blood and different dilutions of viruses were mixed and incubated. The correct dilution of virus was chosen and hemmaglutination with Echinacea P. and virus was performed. Lastly a viral experiment was performed in which another group of MDCK cells were pretreated with Echincea and vehicle. Then Influenza A was addded and allowed two hours to infect cells. The old media containing the virus was removed and new media and Echinacea was added. After 4 days of incubation the cells were examined for cell death.<br><br>Analysis of the resluts show, Echinacea P. did cause the cell to produce one new protein. Yet that change was not enough to stop the Influenza A virus from attaching to and infecting the MDCK cells.<br><br>

ROLE OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR BETA ON OPIOIDS AND OPIOID- RELATED PEPTIDES IN THE RODENT DORSAL HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION
Sana Khalid
High School for Health Professions and Human Services, New York, NY, USA

The endogenous opioids dynorphin (DYN) and leu-enkephalin (LE) and the opioid-related peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK) are known to modulate synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal formation (HF). Prior studies suggest a direct modulation by estrogen of endogenous opioids in the HF. However, there have not been any studies that have explored whether the specific estrogen receptor beta (ER ) is the main one involved. Antibodies to ER and LE or DYN were dually localized in rat hippocampal sections, by electron microscopy (EM). The EM analysis showed that some large terminals (> 1.0 m) identified as mossy fibers, and smaller terminals (approximately 0.5 m) colocalized immunoreactivities for LE and ER and DYN and ER suggesting that activation of ER can directly affect opioid release. To verify a direct connection between ER and opioid and opioid-related peptides, LE, DYN and CCK immunoreactivies were examined by quantitative light microscopy in the hippocampal formation of ER knock out (BERKO) mice. LE-ir showed similar distribution in the hilus of the dentate gyrus as the control mice; DYN-ir and CCK-ir were found to be significantly higher in the BERKO mice. The results of this study provide evidence that endogenous opioids and opioid like peptides levels within the hippocampal circuitry are partially modulated by an ER mechanism. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF PHYTIC ACID ON IRON ABSORPTION USING A POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE TITRATION
Christina Michelle Knippler
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA, USA

This experiment was designed to test if phytic acid in food has an effect on iron absorption. Many people around the world, especially in Third World countries, suffer from anemia and are concerned about adequate iron absorption. The results will help people understand what steps are needed for the most effective iron absorption. The food expected to best aid iron absorption was broccoli, with less phytic acid.<br><br>White rice (high phytic acid) and broccoli (low phytic acid) were tested. Each food was put in dialysis tubes, to simulate the small intestine, with water or an iron supplement, then into a graduated cylinder with distilled water. A control with just the iron supplement and water, and a blank of just water were also tested. After 30 minutes, a sample from each cylinder was titrated with potassium permanganate to determine how much iron passed through the tube. The foods were dried and massed in order to calculate the amount of iron absorbed per gram of dried food. The broccoli provided for better iron absorption, 0.74mg/g, than rice, 0.19mg/g, when the iron supplement was added to each. The control had the highest amount of iron absorption, 1.67mg/g, because there was no food added. <br><br>My hypothesis was valid because the food with the least amount of phytic acid, broccoli, facilitated iron absorption better than the rice, which has high amounts of phytic acid. The broccoli does not hinder iron absorption because there is no phytic acid to bind to the iron, making it indigestible.<br><br>

A NOVEL MODEL FOR THE GLUCOCORTICOID MEDIATED REGULATION OF ARTERIAL INFLAMMATION
Sheel Tyle
Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, New York, United States of America

Atherosclerosis is the process in which plaque builds up in the artery, potentially leading to a myocardial infarction or stroke. Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemokine expressed by activated vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the early atherosclerotic steps, recruits macrophages to the artery, thus promoting blockage. Inhibition of macrophage accumulation may have profound affects on the proliferative, thrombotic, and inflammatory components associated with arterial injury and progressive atherosclerosis. <br><br>The glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (Dex) was previously demonstrated to destabilize MCP-1 mRNA in SMC, leading to a decrease in macrophage accumulation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediates the wide-ranging effects of glucocorticoids on gene expression. To understand the mechanism by which GR mediates MCP-1 mRNA stability, COS cells (monkey kidney cells), which have the machinery to translate recombinant MCP-1 and GR, were used. COS cells transiently transfected with either MCP-1 or GR revealed that Dex-treated COS cells fail to degrade MCP-1 mRNA. However, with GR, the Dex-treated COS cells partially degraded MCP-1 mRNA, suggesting a novel role for GR as a component of a degradative complex that regulates MCP-1 mRNA stability. <br><br>COS stable cell lines were generated to reconstitute an inducible cell expression system and study the regulation of MCP-1 mRNA, as well as to study the mechanism of the GR. Constructs that were transfected into COS cells demonstrate, through staining, that the system functions as an inducible cell expression system. This model can lead to the development of enhanced drug delivery systems to preserve arterial function, thus preventing the onset of atherosclerosis.<br><br>

THE ELUTION OF IODINE OUT OF A HYDROPHILIC WOUND DRESSING
Russell Lee Slater
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, Ct, USA

An innovative type of hydrophilic wound dressing has been developed that can the time release water and provide a sterile environment for a covered wound. In a non-sterile environment, these dressings will do nothing to curb or prevent the spread of bacterial infection. Research on the time release of anti-bacterial medication from these dressings has been limited. The purpose of this project was to successfully infuse I2 into a wound dressing, and demonstrate that this dressing will time release adequate medication to kill and prevent the re-growth of E. coli. To create the dressings, Hydromed-G polyurethane, propylene glycol, distilled water, and iodine tincture were mixed together, heated, and finally ironed to make them workable. A circular medicated wound dressing with a radius of 17 mm was then placed upon a culture of E. coli, and it was later determined that a concentration of 3.75×10-6 moles I2/g dressing would successfully kill E. coli with a 20 mm radius of the area of inhibition (extending 3 mm beyond the dressing) after 26 hours. A similar concentration of I2 was embedded into a wound dressing, and a rate of elution experiment utilizing UV/Vis spectroscopy was developed. Analysis of the elution solutions from this experiment indicates that the optimal concentration of I2 for inhibiting bacterial growth elutes out over a 24-hour period. It can be concluded that time-release antimicrobial wound dressings provide a sterile environment, successfully kill E. Coli bacteria within 26 hours, and release all of their medication within a 24 hour period.

LYSOSOMAL DYSFUNCTION IN RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM; A POSSIBLE PATHOGENESIS OF AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENENERATION (AMD)?
Patrick Ming Chen
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual loss in people over 50, and has been estimated to affect 25-30 million people worldwide. To date, there is no cure for this life-changing disease. The pathogenesis of AMD is an area of intense study. Lysosomal dysfunction is a possible reason for the accumulation of drusen(lipofuscin/lipids), a hallmark of AMD. The goal of this study was to alter lysosomal function with the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine and to determine the effect(s) on cell death, lysosomal morphology and function. Chloroquine is known to raise lysosomal pH. ARPE-19 cells were incubated with chloroquine(0-120ug/ml) for 1, 2, 6, and 24 hours. Cells were counted using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)nuclei staining. Dose response curves demonstrated significant cell death at 40ug/ml starting at 6 hours and peaking at 24 hours. Microscopic examination demonstrated new large clear vacuoles within 2 hours after chloroquine treatment and at doses as low as 10ug/ml. Co-localization studies with Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein (LAMP)-2 monoclonal antibody demonstrated these large clear vacuoles were likely dilated dysfunctional lysosomes. Co-localization studies with fluorescent neutral lipid stain HCS-LipidTOXTM Red showed lipid deposits accumulating in dense bodies instead of the dysfunctional lysosomes. Preliminary functional analysis using rhodamine labeled Dextran demonstrated some chloroquine dependent aberrancies in Dextran accumulation. In summary, these studies suggest a pivotal role of lysosomes in the accumulation of lipofuscin/drusen in AMD. Future studies (confocal microscopy, the application of exogenous substances (dextran, lipids), the relationship to oxidative stress) may provide information about lysosomal functions in AMD.<br><br>

Chen Li
Northeast Yucai School,Shenyang,Liaoning,China

To investigate the HGF-mediated protective function against light damage to retinal pigment epithelium cells( hRPE ). The cDNA of hHGF was obtained from liver tissue by RT-PCR and inserted into plasmid vecter pcDNA3.1. Then the vecter of pcDNA-hHGF was constructed. The constructed plasmid was transfected into hRPE cells cultured in vitro by a lipfection technology. The expression of hHGF was examined by ELISA technology. Then transfected cultured RPE cells and nontrasfected cultured RPE cells were treated with constant exposure to light.The damage levels of both groups were examined by the single cell gel electrophoresis. The result indicats that hHGF transfected hRPE cells significantly survive than nontrasfected hRPE cells. This investigation demostrats that hHGF have significant protective function against light damage to retinal pigment epithelium cells.

A COMPARISON OF EXTRACTABLE LATEX PROTEINS FROM THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF POWDERED LATEX SURGICAL GLOVES
Jessica Ann Lack
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States

BACKGROUND: Natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy is common in people who undergo multiple surgeries and health care workers. However, these two populations show different patterns of allergy from the latex glove. People who undergo multiple surgeries are exposed to the outside of the glove while health care workers are exposed to the inside of the latex glove. PURPOSE: This experiment tested whether there is a difference between the proteins on the inside and outside of a latex rubber glove. PROCEDURE: Samples were isolated from the inside and outside of a latex rubber glove by using solubilization buffer and were separated using PAGE-SDS electrophoresis 10-20% gels. RESULTS: The outside of a latex glove showed two distinct bands, while the inside of a latex glove had only one band. CONCLUSION: This experiment showed that there is a definite difference between the proteins on the inside and outside of a latex rubber glove. Further tests will be needed to identify the specific protein difference and their contribution to patterns of latex allergy in different populations.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT FLUIDS ON HEART RATE
Candace Megan Parrott
Seckman High School, Imperial, Missouri, United States of America

Is water, Gatorade, or soda best for athletic performance based on the way they affect our pulse? This is the question my experiment tested. Research suggests Gatorade is the best type of drink for athletic performance based on pulse rates. I hypothesized that if the subject drinks Gatorade before exerxising, then their pulse will be lower than if they drink water or soda.<br><br> Before conducting tests get parental permission for subjects. There are 20 female subjects, ages 14 and 15. To conduct test, pour 240mL of the liquid into cup. Have subjects drink the liquid being tested. Wait 20 minutes. Have subjects sit for two minutes. Take resting pulse rate at the carotid artery and record. Repeat twice. Have subjects run 100 meters. After they finish running take pulse rate and record. Have subject repeat two more times. Conduct procedure with all other subjects. Next day conduct water test. Repeat procedure with same subjects using water instead of Gatorade. Next day conduct soda test. Repeat procedure with same subjects using soda as the liquid. Average all pulse rate data for each liquid.<br><br> The average pulse rate for Gatorade was 163. The second highest was water, with an average rate of 167. Soda produces the highest pulse rate.<br><br> The data supported my hypothesis. The average pulse rate of the subjects who drank Gatorade before exercising was the lowset. Gatorade is the best drink for athletic performance based on pulse rates.

THE CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG STATIN PREVENTS BREAST TUMOR GROWTH
Nayana Ghosh-Choudhury
Health Careers High School; San Antonio, Texas, United States of America

Cancer is defined as uncontrollable growth of cells. In a clinical study, women who took the cholesterol lowering drug statin, had less occurrence of breast cancer. This observation suggests that statin may cause breast cancer prevention. The hypothesis of this project is statins will inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to test whether statin affected the growth of breast tumor. If statin decreases breast cancer cell growth, then it is beneficial.<br><br> In this project, two statins, lovastatin and simvastatin, were used. Both these statins inhibited the breast cancer cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as determined by a colorimetric method, which measures the presence of viable cells. Using a different method, counting the number of live cells under the microscope directly, confirmed these results. Finally, the effect of simvastatin on progression of breast cancer was tested using a nude mouse model. These mice possess very low immune response. Injection of human breast cancer cells to the mammary fat pads of these mice resulted in significant tumor formation within two weeks. Treatment of the mice with simvastatin prevented the growth and progression of breast tumor in them. Mice treated with simvastatin for three weeks showed significantly less tumor volume, as determined after harvesting the tumor tissues. Therefore, the data supported the hypothesis. In conclusion, simvastatin is beneficial because it reduces the progression of breast cancer along with reduction of the tumor size. Statin can be used to prevent breast cancer in women.<br><br>

MECHANISMS OF INHIBITION AND APOPTOSIS OF HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER CELLS BY EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE
Hang Richard Zou
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States

Purpose: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Patient mortality has been shown to be closely associated with metastatic disease. Prostate cancer cells secrete matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in order to cause metastasis. The purpose of this study was to determine how Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG), the main constituent of green tea, affects the expression of MMP-9 in different prostate cancer cell lines.<br><br><br> <br><br>Procedures Used: The prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3) were treated with different concentrations of EGCG. MMP-9 expression was determined by Western Blot analysis. EGCG dose-dependent apoptosis was monitored by Cell Death Detection and Cell Growth Assays. The alternation of cell structures was observed through light microscopy.<br><br><br> <br><br>Data: MMP-9 expression directly correlated with the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells. Treamtent of cells with Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 expression. EGCG treatment also resulted in an induction of apoptosis in all three prostate cancer cell lines.<br><br><br> <br><br>Conclusion: Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) has the potential to inhibit or delay metastasis and cell invasion by inhibiting MMP-9 invasion. These experiments show that EGCG has detrimental effects against both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and may be useful in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

IMMD: INSTANT MOBILE MEDICAL DATABASE
Mary Rochelle Unsworth
Kingswood Academy, Sulphur, LA, United States of America

Emergency rooms across the country often are confronted with unconscious or incoherent patients who cannot communicate about critical health needs. Unfortunately, this can lead to serious injuries or death. Caregivers need to know immediately about serious medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or severe allergies that could seriously effect treatments. Medical identification is a necessity for these people. <br><br>The only universal option today is medical jewelry that can carry only a minimal amount of data. This jewelry can cost hundreds of dollars but still falls far short of the complete snapshot view emergency personnel both desire and need.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to create a simple, inexpensive database that contains pertinent medical information, which can be accessed quickly by any E.R. Room with a Windows-based computer.<br><br>There are four major elements in this project: a memory stick, an Access database, Windows form (Win Form), and VB .Net code. The memory stick is inexpensive and lightweight. The database is a Microsoft Access database, containing a single table. The table contains personal data and medical information about allergies, medications, medical conditions, medical history, and the patient’s physician. The Windows form displays the information from each of these categories in an easily accessed way. The Visual Basic 2005 code connects the database to the Windows form. The user insert the stick into a USB port, opens Windows Explorer, the clicks on the program. The user can then access and update the information before them.<br><br>Words: 244<br><br>

A NEW TOOL FOR STUDYING CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES OF ADAMTS13 WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR TTP PATIENTS
Tanvi Gupta
Richard Montgomery High School, Rockville, MD, USA

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a blood disorder resulting from deficiency in ADAMTS13, a protein responsible for regulation of blood clotting. ADAMTS13 is a cleavage protease involved in blood clotting as platelets bind to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) substrate. <br><br>The current treatment of plasma exchange is highly inefficient. One key to a more curative treatment is the detection of changes in protein conformation. The activity of the protein is affected by its conformation, which depends on temperature, substrate addition and mutations. Conformational sensitive antibodies are new tools that can monitor such conformation changes of the protein.<br><br>The ADAMTS13 specific antibodies BL154G and Wh2-11-1 were tested for conformational sensitivity in kidney and liver cells. Cells were permeabilized, incubated with the antibodies and tested: 1) with vWF substrate before versus after the antibody; 2) at 37°C versus 4°C; 3) using mutated ADAMTS13-transfected cells. In both cell lines and for both antibodies an increase in binding was observed as increasing concentrations of vWF were added, suggesting that these antibodies detect conformational changes. Moreover, Wh2-11-1 detected conformational changes in the missense mutation (I673F) in the presence of vWF. <br><br>The substantiated conformational sensitivity of BL154G and Wh2-11-1 can potentially dictate manufacturing, storage, and administration conditions for ADAMTS13. This detection will also help doctors administer and monitor a recombinant protein to patients. Additionally it is useful in detecting conformational changes in the protein as a result of a mutation, phosphorilation or other factors. Thus the conformational sensitive antibodies are the next step to a more efficient and remedial treatment for TTP blood disorder. <br><br>

BIM2 INDUCES MAMMARY TUMOR CELLS ADIPOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION INDEPENDENT OF THE PPAR-GAMMA PATHWAY
Chao Yin
Yorktown High School, Arlington VA, USA

Adipocyte differentiation is the process in which non-adipose, or non-fat cells, are transformed into adipose cells. The gene PPAR-gamma plays a key role, but other pathways may also be involved. Preliminary experiment showed that, Bim2, a PKC inhibitor, induces adipocyte differentiation in epithelia cells. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether Bim2 can induce the differentiation of cancer cells into adipose cells and whether the effects are via PPAR-gamma pathway.<br><br> Mammary tumor cells (MC cells) were given the following treatments: GW7845 (PPAR-gamma agonist), GW9662 (PPAR-gamma antagonist), BIM2, and combinations of [GW7845 and GW9662], [Bim2 and GW7845], and [Bim2 and GW9662]. Untreated cultures served as the control. Two setups as described above were prepared. One was used for adipo-Red staining to measure the amount of adipose cells; the other was used for a PPRE reporter assay, to test PPAR-gamma activity.<br><br> The results of the adipo-Red staining, given in relative fluorescent unit (RFU), showed that both GW7845 (16554) and Bim2 (20058) induce MC cells adipocyte differentiation. This effect was attenuated by GW9662 in GW7845 treatment but not in Bim2 treatment. Co-treatment with Bim2 and GW7845 (43093) synergistically increased the adipocyte differentiation compared to the single treatments. For the PPRE assay, the relative light unit (RLU) increased with GW7845 treatment, but not with Bim2. GW9662 blocked GW7845-induced PPAR-gamma activation. <br><br> These results suggested that Bim2’s adipocyte induction is not triggered by the PPAR-gamma pathway. The synergistic effect of the combination of GW7845 and Bim2 may indicate a possible new approach to cancer treatment.<br><br>

PARACRINE EFFECTS OF SENESCENCE- UPREGULATED P21-INDUCED STROMAL FIBROBLASTS ON TRANSFORMED FIBROBLAST LINE C8
Arun Puttachi
Shaker High School, Latham, NY USA

Senescence as defined as permanent growth arrest has become the radically new center for cancer therapy. It has been shown that isopropyl-ß-D- thiogalactoside (IPTG) induced p21 senescence in HT1080 fibrosarcoma lines have caused mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects on the murine highly apoptosis prone C8 line. However, in the full context of tumors, both stromal fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells exist. In order to create a valid picture for senescence in vivo, characterization of paracrine signaling is required. Immortalized BJhTERT with inducible p21 expression served as the stromal fibroblast line whereas C8 served as the same apoptotic prone cell line. This paracrine activity has been shown in fibrosarcoma cells to increase apoptotic protective factors. Describing and comparing paracrine activity between senescent stromal and fibrosarcoma cell lines is of interest in characterizing senescence as well as the growth of cancer. Due to the ability of paracrine proteins to protect cancer cells from apoptosis induced cell death, this research brings molecular oncology into a fascinating and critical realm; this implies that many current cancer treatments (i.e. chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation) may initiate this senescence sequence, causing the carcinoma itself to become larger and even more proliferative– most likely resulting in an even poorer patient prognosis.

HYPOGLYCEMIC EFFECTS OF TECOMA STANS ON SHEEP AS A MODEL FOR TYPE II DIABETES
Leah T.C. Guthrie
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted , St. Croix, U.S.V.I.

Diabetes is the fifth deadliest disease in the United States. Out of the 20.8 million people who have diabetes, which amounts to 7 % of the total population, 6.2 million people are undiagnosed (National Institutes of Health, 2005). African Americans are the largest ethnic group that has Type 2 diabetes, yet one third of them are unaware of their condition (Diabetes Statistics). The purpose of this experiment is to test Tecoma stans for hypoglycemic activity. I hypothesized that Tecoma stans would show anti-diabetic properties due to its reported success as a traditional remedy despite the fact it had not been proven significant through scientific research. In order to test Tecoma stans, I blended the leaves so that the individual particles would be as small as possible. I then added 200 ml of water to 20g of the blended leaves and allowed the mixture to settle for a 24hour period in order for the properties to be extracted. I collected a total of 144 samples and preformed a glucose assay on each. The results were interpreted using a computer program that determines the glucose concentration in mg/dl based on the optical density of the samples. The results showed that Tecoma stans has significant hypoglycemic properties. These results provide an affordable alternative treatment to Type II Diabetes, a disease which is largely affecting the population of the U.S.V.I. and the United States in general at an increasing number. In the future I hope to isolate the compound responsible for the hypoglycemic activity and then research issues of dosage and standardization. Due to the fact that Tecoma stans grows abundantly and does not demand a significantly specific growing conditions it is plausible to market it on large scale opening St. Croix to the pharmaceutical industry.<br><br>

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS MANAGEMENT: A STUDY OF HOLISTIC TREATMENT VS. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE
Tiffany Desir'e Clark
Moore High School, Moore, OK, USA

This study focuses on the treatment of multiple sclerosis symptoms, specifically mental and physical fatigue, memory impairment, ataxia, paresis, dysmetria, and dystonia. The purpose is to test whether holistic treatment (Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-L-Carnitine) or conventional medication (interferon beta-1a) works better in the relief of these symptoms. 16 SJL strain mice were distributed into four groups of four; all groups were induced with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (a disease used to model MS in mice). Group 1 received no treatment. Group 2 received the holistic supplements daily. Group 3 was treated with interferon beta-1a weekly and group 4 received both holistic and conventional medicine. All groups were tested for a period of eight weeks. Since the side effects are not explicitly obvious two tests and a tri-weekly evaluation were used. All mouse groups were run through a maze weekly to test mental/physical fatigue and memory impairment. The times were recorded. There was also a dexterity test to express ataxia, paresis, dysmetria, and dystonia where all mice were recorded while climbing a ladder. The time it took each mouse to ascend the ladder and number of times fallen were recorded weekly. In data and observation, the symptoms were separated. Mice treated holistically excelled in the maze test with the largest decrease in completion times. Mice treated conventionally excelled in dexterity testing with the shortest ascension times and least number of falls. In conclusion, it is suggested to add holistic treatment to the diet for additional treatment of fatigue and memory impairment.

CEACAM-1A IS A POTENT NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE
Melanie Yan-Yan Chow
Rye High School, Rye, New York, United States

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a potentially curative therapy for many life-threatening malignant and non-malignant diseases of the lymphohaematopoietic system, such as leukemia. Unfortunately, up to 80% of BMT patients develop acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a deadly post-transplant complication that leads to immunosuppression, severe damage of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, and a mortality rate of 50%. This study characterizes the ability of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM-1a), a transmembrane protein identified as an important molecule for many immune-mediated diseases, to ameliorate GVHD in clinically relevant murine models. Specifically, this study identifies the novel role of CEACAM-1a as a potent negative regulator of GVHD. In BMT models, it was observed that CEACAM-1a deficiency on either donor T cells or host tissues significantly increases GVHD morbidity and mortality. This increase in GVHD severity was caused by increased expression of cell surface molecule CD25 and downregulation of cell surface molecule CD62L on donor T cells, and an abnormally high accumulation of donor T cells in the mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes and small bowel. In addition, CEACAM-1a deficiency led to increased levels of total white blood cells which are important mediators of GVHD. Overall, this study indicates that CEACAM-1a deficiency directly leads to increased GVHD mortality and that CEACAM-1a is a crucial modulator of GVHD. Therefore, future drug therapies that upregulate CEACAM-1a can decrease GVHD and thus improve the overall curative capacity of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. <br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST HEPATITIS C VIRUS ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEINS E1 AND E2
Supriya Mishra
Ossining High School, Ossining and NY, USA

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to be a major threat to the world’s population. Previous research has shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have the potential to neutralize the virus by interfering with HCV entry mediators, E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. In developing new mAbs against the HCV glycoproteins, it is critical to determine the epitopes or viral regions where these mAbs bind. In this research, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA), in combination with a peptide scanning approach, were used to identify the epitopes of mAbs targeted against the E1 and E2 glycoproteins. mAbs AB E2 #4, AB E2 #5, AB E2 #6 and AB E1 #7 bound to specific E1 or E2 peptides derived from the HCV H77 1a isolate and this lead to the discovery of seven previously unknown linear epitopes. Furthermore, two linear epitopes were shown to be highly conserved across different isolates of HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3 via an alignment test. A subsequent flow cytometry test also found that mAb AB E2 #2 exclusively bound to cells expressing E1 & E2 glycoproteins with fluorescence in 94% of positive cells, suggesting that AB E2 #2 recognizes conformational epitopes on the native E1/E2 complex. When mAbs only bind to HCV if the glycoproteins are in secondary or tertiary structure, mAbs have a conformational epitope as opposed to linear epitopes. Overall, the binding mechanism of mAbs binding to HCV glycoproteins was successfully characterized and this will be useful for future research aimed at developing mAbs directed against HCV.

SOPHOROLIPIDS: A NOVEL THERAPY FOR ASTHMA AND OTHER DISEASES OF ALTERED IGE REGULATION
Michael David Hagler
Rambam Mesivta HS, Lawrence NY, USA

Asthma, which afflicts more that 25% of the world’s population and is one of America’s fastest growing epidemics, is caused by immediate hypersensitivity to excess Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Current therapies reduce IgE’s effects after it has been produced; there remains a need for intervention to decrease the production of IgE, thereby eliminating downstream inflammatory effects. This research investigated the potential of sophorolipids, a low-toxicity glycolipid, to modulate IgE production. Sophorolipids, synthesized by fermentation of C. bombicola, were cultured with U266 human myeloma cells at doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 50.0 and 100.0 mcg/ml sophorolipids for 24, 48 and 72 hours.<br><br> Sophorolipids decreased IgE production by 62% (p<0.0001) in U266 cells at a dose of 100.0 mcg/ml at 24hrs of culture. Decreases were dose-dependent and did not result from mechanisms involving cellular mortality, viability, architecture, apoptosis, or immunoglobulin class switching. Additionally, sophorolipid treatment decreased mRNA expression of TLR2, IL6 and BSAP/PAX5, important IgE regulatory genes. In particular, the complete down-regulation of BSAP/PAX5 expression may be critical to reducing IgE since it is an important regulator of IgE transcription. Thus, sophorolipids may represent a novel therapy for asthma. Future work includes optimizing drug delivery and investigating applications in cancer therapy.<br><br>

WHEN THE THIRD DEGREE IS NECESSARY: DO PEDIATRICIANS OBTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETECT PATIENTS AT RISK FOR HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY?
Jenna Suzanne Kahn
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights NY, USA

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the number one cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Typically, 20% of an infected person's relatives have the condition, and therefore a medical family history is an efficient way to assess a patient's risk for the disease. This study was designed to investigate if pediatricians are collecting sufficient data in medical family histories to ascertain whether children are at risk for HCM as well as to determine physician characteristics associated with updating and taking more thorough histories. Past research has not addressed which family members are usually included in medical family histories nor which of the risk factors of HCM are included. Members of the Second Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics were surveyed via the mail. Surveys were returned by 326 general pediatricians. The majority of pediatricians (98.2%) reported taking family histories; however, only 51.2% reported that they updated this information. Statistical analyses demonstrated that female physicians reported taking significantly more thorough medical family histories than male physicians. In addition, foreign medical school graduates reported taking significantly more thorough medical family histories and updating medical family histories more often than U.S. medical school graduates. This study suggests that pediatricians may not be identifying patients at risk for HCM.

DETECTING CANCER ON THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL USING BIOMECHANICS
Kristin Lesline Hall
Smithtown High School East, St. James, NY, USA

In this investigation, the mechanical and morphological responses of normal keratinocytes and cancerous keratinocytes were measured as a function of the rigidity of their underlying substrates. I used a synthetic elastomer, polybutadiene, and a natural protein, type I collagen, to construct substrates that were mechanically altered without being chemically modified. Cell stiffness was then analyzed using Scanning Modulation Force Microscopy (SMFM). In the case of cancerous and normal keratinocytes, I found that the modulus of normal keratinocytes was greater than that of cancerous keratinocytes. However, both cell types became softer on the stiffer substrates. Images taken with the confocal microscope correlated the changes in cellular elasticity with variations in filopodia protrusion and cortical actin density. Finally, I plated cells on sulfonated polystyrene surfaces to induce the fibrillogenesis of their extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. I found that the ECMs of all cell types varied in their rigidities and structures. This has implications for tissue engineering and cancer detection.

FUNCTION AND POSSIBLE CLINCIAL APPLICATION OF THE EMBRYONIC GENE NANOG IN CANCER
Thomas Hamilton Lipscomb
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA

Only a few cancer cells have the ability to replicate indefinitely. They are called cancer stem cells. The embryonic gene Nanog is responsible for maintaining embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in an immature state to maintain their self-renewal capability and allow long-term proliferation. The aim was to determine if decreasing Nanog expression could decrease HL60 cancer cell proliferation as it does in ESCs. My previous work shows that Nanog is expressed in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell line HL60.<br><br>Trypan blue staining shows that the HL60 cell proliferation and HL60 cell population decreased when HL60 was subjected to 25 micromolars of sodium orthovanadate. Real-time PCR suggest a simultaneous decrease in Nanog expression, as expected from previous research with ESCs.<br><br>These preliminary results show that a decrease in embryonic gene Nanog expression happens concurrently with a decrease in the cancer cell population. This may justify future research to investigate a possible causal relationship, with the goal of creating cancer therapy that does not affect most normal adult cells by targeting embryonic genes using gene-based therapy by delivering shRNAi- or Zinc Finger Nuclease-plasmids.<br><br>

SUPPRESSION OF BREAST CANCER ANGIOGENESIS AND METASTASIS BY P16 VIA DOWNREGULATING VEGF
Andrew Yunrong Lu
White Station High

One of the major causes of failure in the treatment of breast cancer is the occurrence of metastasis, the spreading of the primary tumor to distant organs. It is thus important to intervene at a key step of metastatic process, such as angiogenesis, for effective breast cancer treatment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. Because the degree of tumor malignancy directly correlates with the expression of VEGF but inversely correlates with the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16, we examined whether the restoration of p16 in breast cancer cells that lack p16 expression would modulate VEGF expression, and if so, what are the effects of p16 expression on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. To facilitate the induction of p16 expression, a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing p16 (AdRSVp16) was used to transduce breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and JygMC(A). This study showed that adenoviral-mediated p16 expression downregulated VEGF expression in breast cancer cells at both mRNA and protein levels, inhibited breast cancer cell-induced angiogenesis, and suppressed breast tumor metastasis in a spontaneous metastasis model in mice. Moreover, the mechanism of how p16 regulates VEGF expression is also investigated.

THE GENE SILENCING OF MGMT AND THE BENEFIT OF TEMOZOLOMIDE IN GLIOBLASTOMAS
Andrew Allen Gilbert
Northern Utah Academy of Math Engineering and Science, Roy, Utah, USA

This project investigates findings from published research, which hypothesized that suppression of (O6-methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase) MGMT (through gene therapy) would make chemotherapy more effective. Since MGMT is a repair gene that effectively repairs damaged cells, favoring high (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) VEGF levels (cancer having the highest), it may well benefit cancer cells to a much greater extent than normal cells. A total of 70 tumors (ranging from low to high grade) were randomly chosen from a pool for which the histories have been cataloged, and the following procedure was performed:<br><br>1. The sectioned tumors were incubated in the primary antibody.<br><br>2. The tumors were stained and counter-stained for counting.<br><br>3. Six pictures were taken from random sections of the tumors.<br><br>4. A computerized count was taken of the positive cells divided by the total cells, a proliferation index.<br><br>5. The patient survival rates were obtained through the tumor database.<br><br>6. The correlation was made by the comparison of the levels of MGMT and survival data.<br><br> There was a very strong negative correlation (r= -.854), meaning that the higher the MGMT expression the lower the survival rate. By suppressing this gene the survival rates could greatly improve, as well as improving the accuracy of patient survival estimates. While it is true that the normal cells would not be repaired as efficiently during this treatment, the benefits (particularly with the short time of treatment) would far out weigh this negative side effect. The projected success of this project is promising; the preliminary tests show this project to be very effective (once again referring to the r=-.854).<br><br>

INTEGRATED MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
Carol Yoon Joo Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, USA

Stem cell technology can help pave the way for personalized medicine, but current methodologies prevent from doing so. Human embryonic stem cell cultures are contaminated with animal products, preventing transplantations. Lack of understanding of stem cells in their microenvironments hinders tissue engineering and accurate drug screening. In order to address these problems, an integrated microfluidic device that can sustain the growth and development of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was developed. The device was fabricated by soft-lithography. HSF1 hESCs were cultured inside the device with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and cultured media. The stemness (undifferentiated state) of the cells was confirmed through immunostaining with AP, DAPI, Oct-4 and SSEA-4. Stem cell growth curves derived from a stem cell line with GFP expression matched conventional methods and were robust. This device is an efficient system for developing human embryonic stem cells. Later it can be used for high-throughput drug screening and the creation of animal free culture systems.

BIOPRODUCTION OF A PLEIOTROPIC REGULATORY CYTOKINE FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION AGAINST HUMAN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
David Jueyu Wang
A.B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, Canada

Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic regulatory cytokine that plays a protective role against many autoimmune-associated diseases such as type-1 diabetes (T1D) and rheumatoid arthritis. To develop an IL-13-based immune therapy for treating such diseases with high efficiency, unique low cost, and suitability for oral administration, I generated transgenic plants last year to express recombinant human IL-13 (rhIL-13). The objective of this year’s study is to characterize the plant-derived transgenic protein at both molecular and functional levels. Northern blotting showed that the introduced rhIL-13 gene is correctly transcribed in transgenic plants. Protein immunoblotting analysis coupled with enzymatic deglycosylation demonstrated that the plant-derived rhIL-13 protein is expressed in the form of three major glycosylated peptides, similar to that found in its human counterpart. The expression levels of rhIL-13 in transgenic leaf tissues were found to reach as high as 0.15% of total soluble protein (TSP). In vitro bioassays using a factor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1, showed that the plant-derived rhIL-13 retains the biological functions of the authentic hIL-13 protein. Moreover, the plant-produced glycosylated rhIL-13 was found to be much less prone to pancreatic proteolysis, suggesting it is suitable for oral administration. Finally, results from the research lab's feeding of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model for human T1D, with hIL-13 transgenic leaf tissues lowered the incidence of T1D. Taken together, these results suggest that transgenic plants may represent a novel cost-effective approach to the prevention and treatment of clinical human autoimmune diseases such as T1D through oral delivery of its expressed recombinant human cytokine IL-13.

PREDICTING DRUG RESPONSE IN ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA
Ketaki Rawal
Centennial Regional High School, Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada. 

Alzheimer’s Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder which leads to decline in memory and cognitive function. Function of both cholinergic and glutametergic systems, as well as lipid homeostasis in the brain, are known to be disrupted and abnormal in AD patients. The etiology of AD includes genetic and environmental factors. Available treatments include: Cholinesterase Inhibitors (CHEI) and NMDAR Antagonists (memantine). <br><br>Clinical trials have shown that 1/3 of patients do not respond to CHEI treatment. This often leads to further cognitive decline in non-responders. This experiments aims to determine if genetic variations in the ApoE, BCHE-K, and PON 1 l55m genes predict response to a CHEI and/or memantine. These three genes play a role in cholinergic action and lipid homeostasis in the brain. <br><br>Saliva from patients on a CHEI and CHEI + memantine was collected. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the three genes were determined for the subjects through pyrosequencing. <br><br>ApoE 4 and BCHE Wild Type were found to be predictors of CHEI response. BCHE Wild Type is a predictor of dual response (memantine + CHEI), and PON 1 may be a borderline predictor of dual response. This new method of pharmacogenomics would replace the current “trial and error” approach in treatment of AD. These findings would help physicians choose the optimal drug for each individual patient, immediately on diagnosis, preventing unnecessary delay in treatment. <br><br>

PROBING FOR CANCER WITH SMART SHRNA
Yale Stern Michaels
Grant Park High School, Winnipeg Manitoba, Canada 

In order to provide the most effective possible treatment, cancer must be diagnosed early and accurately and treatment must be both highly effective and specific. This project aimed to address these issues by exploring a timely, cost effective, potent and cancer specific alternative to conventional cancer therapy. <br><br> A molecular probing system capable of detecting cancer indicating messenger RNA (mRNA) has been designed and synthesized to address these goals. Theoretical development focused on creating a system able to interpret the expression levels of cancer indicators, oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and in turn, produce a drug molecule in a cell specific manner. <br><br> The probing system I have designed is composed entirely of RNA and can be processed by an RNase III family enzyme in live cells. It consists of three main components, a hybridization probe targeting an mRNA of choice, an input molecule that interprets the probe-target hybridization level, and a processor short hairpin RNA that transforms the input into an output RNA antisense strand designed to induce cell death.<br><br> A proof of concept probe was designed to detect expression of the SV40 Large tumor antigen, a viral oncogene. It in turn produces antisense against a fluorescent reporter (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein). The probing system is effective in vitro and is being optimized in 293 T cells. Subsequent probes have been designed to evaluate expression of multiple genes and release antisense against Bcl-2 in order to induce cell death. This system provides a novel diagnostic and therapeutic tool. <br><br>

EVALUATION OF TARGETING EFFICIENCY OF RGD FLUORESCENT LIPOSOMES IN SOLID TUMORS USING BIO-IMAGING
Anuj Atul Shukla
White Station High School, Memphis, TN, United States of America 

In cancer research, there is a need for targeted drug therapies that specifically act on the angiogenic blood vessels in solid tumors. During angiogenesis, integrin receptors, particularly ávâ3 integrins, are strongly expressed on the activated endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels. Therefore, targeted drug carriers, such as liposomes with an integrin receptor specific ligand attached to their surface, could be used to efficiently bind to the ávâ3 integrins. Upon binding, the liposomes could release an antiangiogenic drug inside the activated endothelial cells and kill the surrounding blood vessels responsible for feeding the tumor. To meet these criteria, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide(receptor specific ligand) was conjugated onto the surfaces of liposomes containing a fluorescent dye. In vitro studies, such as determination of particle size distribution and zeta potential, were done to characterize the fluorescent liposomes. A cell uptake procedure was then conducted to ensure that the targeted liposomes could effectively bind to the endothelial cells before in vivo administration. After the in vitro studies, the RGD-conjugated fluorescent liposomes and unconjugated (non-RGD) fluorescent liposomes were administered and visualized using near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging technique to compare their localization at the tumor site in a nude mouse model. The results demonstrated that there was greater accumulation of RGD-conjugated fluorescent liposomes at the tumor site compared to the unconjugated fluorescent liposomes. Therefore, this study showed that RGD-conjugated liposomes have the potential to target anticancer drugs such as antiangiogenic agents to solid tumors and simultaneously monitor their therapeutic efficiency using near infrared bio-imaging.

I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT ! AN INTRODUCTION TO PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
Romita Sur
Hillfield Strathallan College, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a photosensitizer and specific wavelength of laser light to produce singlet oxygen that kills cancer cells. Light is transmitted using a mibrofibre or a microfiber lens and the power of the light beam is assumed to be uniform throughout the light field.<br><br><br>I examined the uniformity of laser light dose using a microfiber lens for delivery of PDT at the Cancer Centre. I shone a 4cm diameter laser beam used for PDT on a detector fibre which was measured by a light power detector (in mW). Power of light was measured at various intervals starting from the centre of the beam (where it was highest) moving outwards on the left and right of the beam (where it was lowest). Output was not uniform at the same points measured from the centre of the beam on either side. In a 4cm diameter beam, 50% light power was measured at 1.5cm radius. The remaining 0.5cm that was visible to the eye had very low light dose and was possibly inadequate for PDT. <br><br><br>This experiment has major clinical implications as it demonstrates that cancer recurrences/ failures can happen in the light field after PDT due to insufficient light power at the beam edge. Before any PDT treatment, the light field should be calibrated to avoid areas of under dosing. Where multiple beams are being used, the overlap point needs to be calibrated at the point where there is 50% light power and not at the visible light edge.<br><br>

A NOVEL PATHWAY FOR PTEN CHEMOSENSITIZATION
Yuyang John Mei
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA, United States of America

My previous study showed that tumor suppressor protein PTEN sensitizes breast cancer cells to but protects normal cells from cisplatin. However, the mechanism for these effects was uninvestigated. Current study attempts to elucidate the relationship between PTEN and High Mobility Group B1 protein (HMGB1, an inhibitor of cisplatin-DNA adduct repair), and determine whether this relationship could be a potential mechanism for PTEN’s effects. It was hypothesized that the overexpression of PTEN would increase nuclear HMGB1 levels in MDA-231 (cancer) cells undergoing cisplatin treatment; the opposite would occur in MCF 10A (normal) cells. PTEN was transiently transfected into MCF 10A and MDA-231 cells. After 24 hours, 1 µM cisplatin was added into the cell media. Nuclear and cytoplasmic portions of the cells were separated at 0, 6, and 24 hours post-treatment. HMGB1 expression was determined at these time-points by Western blot. MDA-231 cells expressed more total HMGB1 and had a higher proportion of cytoplasmic HMGB1 (p<0.05 except at 24 hours) than MCF 10A cells regardless of PTEN overexpression. The overexpression of PTEN increased nuclear HMGB1 and decreased cytoplasmic HMGB1 in MDA-231 cells. These data suggest that PTEN chemosensitizes MDA-231 cells by inducing the localization of HMGB1 to the nucleus. The low proportion of cytoplasmic HMGB1 provides a hint as to why PTEN does not sensitize MCF 10A cells. These findings imply a novel pathway for PTEN chemosensitization in breast cancer cells, which could facilitate the design and discovery of new chemosensitizing agents and chemotherapeutic drugs.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTICANCER DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM: A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR THE DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC MACROMOLECULES
Shivani Sud
Charles E Jordan Senior High School, Durham NC, USA

Cellular introduction of therapeutic compounds is essential for cancer treatment through chemotherapy. However, efficient intracellular delivery and correct localization of pharmaceutical macromolecules remains problematic due to cell membrane imposed barriers.<br><br> Residues 47-57 of the HIV-1 Tat protein are sufficient for intracellular transduction and subcellular localization. A novel expression vector delivery system utilizing these residues, green fluorescent protein, and a murine secretion chain was developed during this study. In the homologous recombination assay exogenous Rad51, a vital protein in double strand DNA break repair, fused in the delivery system retained biological function with 66% efficiency. Media transduction of employed Rad51 resulted in suppression of U87 MG, a brain astrocytoma cell line. Caspase-3, a key cell death inducing protein was cloned into the vector construct to potentially induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in astrocytoma cells.<br><br> The delivery system causes the transduction of functional full length proteins 74 times larger than the current bioavailability size restriction, and causes one vector to enter into multiple cells without intercellular contact, while promoting refolding and retention of biological activity. This unique delivery system has the potential to combat infectious diseases and caner through the introduction of therapeutic compounds and peptides to cells. <br><br>

IN VITRO COMPARISON OF ANIMAL BLADDER TISSUE ELASTICITY WITH URINARY BALLOON MODEL ELASTICITY
Raj Shah
Beall High School, Frostburg, MD, Allegany

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the elasticity of the urinary bladder using a balloon model and to investigate how well the elasticity compares with animal bladder tissue. Controls used in the study were the same measuring apparatus, tools, method, time intervals, cutting utensils, formalin and weights. The independent variable was stress and the dependent variable was the strain. Prior to conducting the experiments, necessary background information was obtained, the materials were conditioned and sanitized and sample runs were conducted to check for systemic errors. Trials were conducted to measure the elasticity of the animal bladder tissue. Two hundred gram weights were attached to the bladder at ten minute intervals and measurements were recorded. At five minute intervals the weights were removed so that measurements could be taken again to see if the bladder had reached its plastic state yet. If the measurement did not correspond with the data before the last weight was added, then the bladder was considered to be at its plastic state. The process was repeated for the balloon material and multiple trials were conducted. The results between the animal bladder tissue and latex material match well and support the hypothesis. All graphs fit a cubic relationship well. This indicates that the next steps in creating an artificial bladder can be implemented and an artificial balloon bladder is near to being tested in animals and humans.

MODELING BACTERIAL RESISTANCE
Cynthia Amanda Tena
Grants High School, Grants, NM, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to show how quickly and easily antibiotic resistance can develop an attempt was made to demonstrate inducible resistance by plasmid transfer between bacteria.<br><br> First a 0.5 McFarland was made with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (resistant to ampicillin) and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (sensitive to ampicillin). The idea behind the experiment was to demonstrate that genes for resistance are spread from one bacteria to another by plasmid transfer. The bacteria were grown in Triptic Soy Broth to model fluid environment such as the human intestine. After 24 hrs, the bacteria were streaked for isolation onto MacConkeys agar. Colonial morphology was used to identify the E. coli, which was subsequently challenged by exposure to ampicillin. MIC was determined by an Ampicillin E Test strip. An MIC < 8 indicates sensitivity to ampicillin. <br><br> The E coli gained resistance to ampicillin after a short exposure to K. pneumoniae. While conclusive proof of plasmid transfer would required DNA analysis, the assumption was made that because E coli was shown to become resistant to ampicillin, that this is indirect evidence of plasmid transfer from K. pneumoniae to E. coli.<br><br>

DEVELOPING A COST-EFFECTIVE TIME-RELEASED DISCRIMINATORY INSECT REPELLENT
Emily Nicole Bick
Millburn High School, Short Hills New Jersey, USA

Medically, an insect repellent reduces health risks associated with harmful insects. All existing repellents currently in widespread use are nondiscriminatory, and have the undesirable effect of repelling beneficial insects. A discriminatory insect repellent repels more harmful than beneficial insects (defined by Pennsylvania Integrated Pest Management Program). My prior research with a discriminatory insect repellent demonstrated that its effectiveness diminishes more rapidly than DEET. Microencapsulation suggested a solution, since it is known to be a safe and effective way to extend effectiveness of a perfume. The current project involved designing a testing apparatus, preparing microencapsulated repellent, and testing the microencapsulation for extending the lifetime of the repellent and preserving the repellent’s discriminatory properties. Experimental data showed microencapsulation enhances the lifetime of the repellent with a statistical uncertainty of less than 5%. This was measured over a one month period. Results show that the microencapsulated discriminatory repellent maintained its initial effectiveness for 30% longer than a non-microencapsulated discriminatory repellent. The discriminatory properties of the repellent were maintained by the microencapsulate. The World Health Organization reports that insect borne diseases kill millions more children than cancer annually. A 30% improvement in repellent duration could have a net health effect for the world's children even greater than a cure for cancer would. While pharmacological and toxicity effects of the new repellent, and of the microencapsulated form, must be studied before such a product can be applied to human use, it is likely, given the current use of microencapsulation in perfumes, that the microencapsulation idea presents no health risks, and could result in a significant improvement in the effectiveness of many types of repellents.

WHICH FLAVOR DO PEOPLE IDENTIFY THE FASTEST?
Andrea Jaymes Irsfeld
Trinity High School, Dickinson North Dakota, United States

The purpose of my project was to see which flavor a person could identify the fastest. I thought that it would be good information for candy or medicine companies. If a person can identify which flavor it is right away without having to think about it then maybe they would be more willing to buy that product. I started by filling 6 bottles with 50ml of a simple syrup, adding 20 drops of FlavoRx, a pharmacy flavoring system, and mixing it well. I would then measure out 0.2oz of the substance on the back of the subjects hand and time them from the time they licked it off to the time they guessed what flavor they thought it was. I then recorded my data and came up with three different sets of results: the girls, the boys, and the total. I also collected two different sets of data for each set of results: everyone's average time, and the average time of everyone who was right. I found out that bubble gum was identified the fastest correctly and that banana was identified the slowest. I also found out that bubble gum was responded to the fastest and orange the slowest.

DESIGN AND GENERATION OF A DIVERSE VIRTUAL CHEMICAL LIBRARY
Jeremiah James Bearss
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, United States

The use of computational methods that 'dock' small molecules into macromolecular structures and 'score' their potential binding affinity to binding sites is becoming possible in the identification and optimization of lead drug candidate molecules. Searching 3D virtual databases has proven to be an effective and efficient method for identifying novel drug lead candidates based upon an initial search query, but the use of these databases is limited by the size and diversity of the chemical structures contained within the database. Current drug discovery efforts utilize only a small fraction of the potential 1060 small molecules that make up the whole of drug chemical space. New diverse chemical libraries are needed to explore previously unidentified pharmacophores and pharmaceutically active compounds. To construct a large and chemically diverse virtual chemical library a chemical building algorithm was utilized. The algorithm allowed for the addition of a reaction site to a set of 3D building blocks to generate novel chemical structures. These structures were converted to SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification) format and run through the chemical library building program, SMILIB. The output of SMILIB is every possible combination of chemical structures that can be generated from the combination of the reaction sites and the 3D building blocks. This dataset was organized into a large and diverse virtual chemical library that can be utilized in 3D searching and docking against potential drug protein targets.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INSULIN DELIVERY SYSTEM
David Christopher Evans
Albion Middle School, Sandy, Utah, United States

Insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes has recently been improved with the introduction of continuous glucose monitoring. I propose that an Artificial Intelligence program can learn glucose response to insulin on an individual basis with greater accuracy and allow for a truly closed loop system or artificial pancreas. Phase I: An Artificial Intelligence program was created based on a neural network model. Matlab was the programming language used to create a multilayer, recurrent network for back-prop-learning. This multilayer network adjusted the weights slightly after each epoch until the changes in the weights were small. Phase II: Two type 1 diabetic volunteers agreed to test the AI program for insulin delivery. For the first month, self-administration of insulin was completed based on the subjects’ initial glucose values and previous two-hour post-insulin glucose values. This was the learning data entered into the AI program. Over the next two months, the subjects recorded their initial glucose readings and the time of day. Then the AI program calculated the proper insulin dose. The two-hour post-insulin learning data was then compared with the two-hour post-insulin AI directed results. A student t-test was used to determine statistical significance between the two months. For the first subject, one testing time was found to be statistically significant during the first month, but two testing times were significant during the second month. The second subject’s comparison revealed two significant testing times in the first month and three significant testing times in the second month. This confirmed that learning had occurred from the first to the second month. The AI program provided tighter insulin control than could be accomplished individually. However, exercise and carbohydrate intake must remain consistent for this program to work effectively. Further programming for carbohydrate intake will lead to a functional artificial pancreas that will learn with time. <br><br>

REPEATED INJECTION EXPOSURES TO NAPHTHALENE PRODUCE TERMINAL BRONCHIOLAR CLARA CELL TOLERANCE IN FEMALE MICE
Ryan Ko
Mission San Jose High School, Fremont, CA, USA

Non-ciliated "Clara" lung cells in male mice can develop a “tolerance,” or resistance, against naphthalene, a common toxic pollutant, after repeated injections. This experiment aimed to determine whether tolerance can be induced in female mice. Three groups of five female mice each, from a completed study by mentor, were used: group one was injected with seven daily doses of naphthalene (200 mg per kg body weight), group two received the same treatment as group one plus an additional challenge dose (300 mg per kg body weight) on the eighth day, and the control group received seven daily doses of corn oil (200 mg per kg body weight). I conducted the rest of the experiment: Mice lung cross-sections were imaged under light microscopy and counts of nonciliated, ciliated, and vacuolated cells were tabulated. Stereological techniques were used to calculate bronchiolar epithelium thickness, volume fraction, and volume per surface area of the three cell types. An ANOVA statistical test was run, and no statistically significant differences of the parameters measured were found between treated and non-treated cells. Repeated injection exposures of naphthalene produced no observable difference in terminal bronchiolar Clara cells of female mice studied.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF FENRETINIDE TREATMENT ON DU145 AND HUH7 CANCER CELLS
Madison Lyn Grinnell
Brownell-Talbot College Preparatory School, Omaha Nebraska, USA

Vitamin A is attracting attention as a potential chemopreventive agent. To investigate the effect of a vitamin A analog on cancer cell growth, DU145 (human prostate cancer) and Huh7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines were exposed to no fenretinide (ethanol only) as a control, a large level, 5?M fenretinide, and a small level, 50 nM fenretinide, each dissolved in ethanol. These results were compared to non-cancerous cell lines, D9 (mouse fibroblast) and 293T (human kidney), to compare the effects of fenretinide on cancerous vs. non-cancerous cell types. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability after exposure to different levels of fenretinide; the conversion of MTT to a colored product is directly dependent on the metabolic activity of mitochondria and thus measures the number of living cells. The absorbance of colored solution (MTT) was quantified by measuring at a 690 nm wavelength using a spectrophotometer. Fenretinide had a negative effect on cell growth in both cancer cell lines; however, the non-cancerous cell lines were not responsive to either concentration of fenretinide. Thus, fenretinide treatment demonstrated anti-tumor activity without systemic toxicity. The Agarose Gel Electrophoresis investigated the apoptosis response; chromosomes affected by apoptosis had a regular pattern of fragmentation while those affected by necrosis exhibited an irregular pattern. Fenretinide treatment overwhelmingly incited an apoptotic response in cancer cell lines while non-cancerous cell lines were not responsive to different levels of fenretinide. Vitamin treatment of cancer could potentially have a less harmful effect on surrounding non-cancerous tissue.

INVESTIGATING THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS ON VASCULAR TISSUE REPAIR BY MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS
Lia D'Abate
The Sacred Heart School of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada 

It has been proposed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are involved in vascular tissue repair induced by pathogenesis caused by exposure to risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. This experiment investigates the influence of four stimuli mimicking cardiovascular risk factors, H202 (0.1 mM), dextrose (25 mM), CRP (7.5 mg/L), and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL – 50 micrograms/L – normalized on ApoB content), on MSC differentiation into osteoblasts, myofibroblasts, and endothelial cells. We hypothesized that risks for cardiovascular disease are detrimental to MSC differentiation and/or survival.<br><br> MSC derived from human bone marrow were grown to confluence and stimulated for differentiation into the three respective cell types. The cell culture medium was changed every 3-4 days at which time morphological changes in the cells were monitored. Immunohistochemical assays were used to confirm MSC differentiation through the identification of cell-specific protein markers (myofibroblasts – alpha-actin/myosin, osteoblasts – osteopontin/alkaline phosphatase, and endothelial cells – CD31/vWF). <br><br> Differentiation was observed for all three cell types without stimuli but with moderate protein expression. Thus far, H202, CRP, and oxy-LDL appeared to inhibit cell proliferation, while there were no observable changes in cell numbers for dextrose. Problems encountered with data acquisition seem technical rather than experimental. The influence of the four stimuli as well as quantitative protein marker expression remains to be validated. <br><br> Future experiments on human MSC will serve to quantify differences in differentiation. This research is invaluable in delineating the mechanisms of tissue repair which can potentially lead to early intervention and, consequently, better vascular health maintenance. <br><br>

ESTABLISHING NOP56/NOPP140 PROTEIN INTERACTIONS IN THE FRUIT FLY, DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: DEVELOPING A MODEL FOR THE HUMAN TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
Elisabeth Conlin Laughlin
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA 

The Treacher Collins Syndrome, a craniofacial birth disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 births, is directly linked to mutations in the nucleolar protein Treacle. Treacle is a ribosomal protein and when there is a lack of the protein, defects occur in the cell. Nucleolar proteins, Treacle and Nopp140, have similar structure and function. Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, lacks Treacle. A loss of Nopp140 causes defects similar to Treacher Collins Syndrome like Treacle. In humans, Nop56 and Treacle interact. Therefore, the Nucleolar protein Nop56 should interact with human Treacle. Also, Nop140 should be substituted for Treacle in Drosophila. The Nop56 cDNA was transformed from an entry clone plasmid to three destination vectors, specifically pTGW which encodes the green florescent protein, pTRW which encodes the red florescent protein, and pPFW which encodes the flag. If the w1118 Drosophila that was co-injected with the transposase and the destination vector produced transgenic flies , the transgene had successfully entered a chromosome. Transgenic flies were produced from the injected w1118 Drosophila in pTGW and pPFW plasmids. pTGW transgenic flies, crossed to daughterless GAL4, concluded that the Nop56 GFP was localized in the cells’ nucleoli. This was compared to a Nopp140 antibody which concluded that it was also in the nucleoli. This co-localization suggests the proteins’ interaction in Drosophila. Current experimentation includes pulling down all the proteins that interact with Nop56 by immuno-precipitation. This will confirm the hypothesis as well as provide data for further investigation of Treacher Collins Syndrome by use in Drosophila. <br><br><br><br>

DENDRIMER-BASED NANODEVICES FOR DRUG DELIVERY ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER
Shravani Mikkilineni
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI, USA

Dendrimers are emerging as a relatively new class of nanoscale polymeric biomaterials (~5nm) with applications in drug delivery, targeting, and imaging. Achieving a high drug payload in dendrimers, and understanding the therapeutic effect of dendrimers – drug conjugates are receiving increasing attention. This is especially relevant in neurodegenerative disorders, where delivering drugs across the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and releasing the drug in a sustained manner are key challenges. This interdisciplinary research, which brings together neurotechnology and medicine, seeks to develop a more efficient way to deliver dopamine to the brain to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD), using dendrimers as the nanovehicle. The dendrimer-based nanodevice will be trafficked across the BBB and will target microglial cells, resulting in suppression of PD associated inflammation. This study works to create a novel conjugate which combines small size, lipophilic end functionality, and unique cell uptake profiles into microglial cells to develop a sustained drug delivery device. The dendrimer-dopamine conjugate was designed, and synthesized using a covalent coupling reaction. Conjugation was evidenced by 1H-NMR characterization; further analysis demonstrated a high payload of 14.2. The uptake of the conjugate into microglial cells is being tested using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The results suggest that dendrimers with high drug payload improve the drug’s efficacy by enhanced cellular delivery, and may produce a rapid pharmacological response. Further, the linking chemistry between the drug and the dendrimer will be manipulated to alter the sustained release kinetics. Eventual in vivo validation can be achieved using PET imagining of brain activity.

THE EFFECTS OF MELATONIN ON THE CUMULATIVE SLEEP TIME AND THE INCEPTION OF SLEEP OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Sasha Ariellle Foo
Oak Grove High School, San Jose California, the United States of America 

This project attempts to gain insight into the sleep cycle of humans, one related to the sleep cycle of Drosophila. It also demonstrates the adverse and positive effects daytime melatonin using a Drosophila model. The hypothesis was that if 0.0015 g of melatonin was added to the food source of the flies, the total sleep time would be twenty minutes longer than the control and the onset of sleep would occur thirty minutes earlier than the control, and if 0.003 g of melatonin was added, the total sleep time would last thirty minutes longer than the control and the onset of sleep will occur fourty minutes minutes later. Three cultures of seven virgin female fruit flies were used. One culture was a control. The next culture contained 0.0015 g of melatonin, and the last culture contained 0.003 g of melatonin. The amount of melatonin was chosen by scaling down the recommended dosage for adults of average weight proportionally to be accurate for the average weight of a female fruit fly. The fruit flies were tape recorded at night. These tapes were reviewed, and the sleep patterns were recorded. The inception of sleep and cumulative sleep time were used as the indicators of a sleep cycle. Each culture was put underneath the box with a security camera and a light. All cultures were under equal conditions in order to ensure that all flies recieved the same amount of light and that the light did not vary from day to day. The 0.0015 flies fell asleep fourty-four minutes before the control and slept fourty-nine minutes longer. The 0.003 g flies fell asleep and hour and five minutes before the control and slept an hour and six minutes longer. The T- Test results indicated that in all conditions p<0.001. The data shows that melatonin has a large impact on the sleep cycle of Drosophila.<br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A URINE TEST FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER
Janet Song
Methacton High School, Norristown, Pennsylvania, United States of America

The success of cancer treatment depends upon early detection, and a noninvasive substrate is needed to increase compliance rates for cancer screening. DNA in human urine has been shown to resolve into two size categories: high molecular weight (MW) DNA, greater than 1 kb, from the urinary tract, and low MW DNA, between 150 to 250 bp, mostly from the circulation. In this project, a low MW urine DNA isolation method was invented/established, and a noninvasive urine DNA test was then developed for the early detection of colorectal cancer. To quantify the efficacy of high MW DNA removal, a real-time PCR quantification assay was established. Low MW DNA was isolated from total urine DNA derived from five volunteers and then quantified by real-time PCR. It was found that 92.72% + 1.42% of high MW DNA was removed from the total DNA. To evaluate the effectiveness of this technique on detecting the K-ras mutation, low MW DNA was isolated from the total DNA of 36 human urine samples that had been previously tested for the K-ras mutation. Restriction Endonuclease-Enriched PCR and Peptide Nucleic Acid mediated-clamped real-time PCR was performed. It was found that there was a much more sensitive detection of the K-ras mutation in low MW DNA as compared to total DNA. The potential use of this finding in furthering the early detection of colorectal carcinoma is explored.

A QUANTIFICATION OF AXON-SPROUTING IN THE MOUSE SPINAL CORD AFTER MOTOR CORTEX STROKE
Kathryn Lynn Ayers
Parkway West High School Ballwin MO USA

Activation of new areas following stroke may be due to new axon pathways forming in order to compensate for sustained damage. Previous studies in rodent brains suggest that new axon formation following stroke corresponds to recovery of motor functions. Little is known about the reaction of axon projections in the spinal cord after stroke. In this study, it was hypothesized that after stroke in the left motor cortex of mice, neurons from the uninjured right motor cortex will sprout new axon pathways to the right side of the spinal cord, opposite to where they normally project. Fixed spinal cord tissue was used from mice who previously received an experimentally induced stroke, followed by injection of the neuronal tracer BDA into the uninjured cortex to visualize axonal projections. The amount of BDA labeling in square micrometers was quantified in the white matter dorsal corticospinal tract (originates from the motor cortex) and is representative of the number of axons projecting from the injected left motor cortex. Sprouting was observed in the left dorsal corticospinal tract of both mice. However in the right dorsal corticospinal tract, stroke mice demonstrated minimal sprouting compared to sham mice. Increased sprouting was observed in the gray matter outside the dorsal corticospinal tract in stroke mice. This suggests that axons may sprout from the uninjured dorsal corticospinal tract and project to the gray matter. Further study of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this axon sprouting may be important for developing new therapeutics for stroke and other brain injuries.

DARKSIDE OF ANTI-HORMONAL THERAPIES FOR BREAST CANCER TREATMENT
Tejal Ulhas Naik
The Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, Delaware, USA

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and second major cause of death amongst women today. Breast cancer causes death mainly because it metastasizes from the primary site to secondary sites. Growth factors and hormones are known to stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation, causing tumor growth. Present day anti-hormonal therapies are used to halt the growth of breast cancer. However, the therapies are suspected to enhance invasive tumors. Previously, I have shown that the down-regulation of Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), a tight junction protein that keeps cell together, is responsible for breast cancer cell metastasis. I hypothesized that anti-hormonal therapies are inducing breast cancer cell invasion by reducing the expression of JAM-A. To test this I used two growth factors, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Estradiol. Both hormones dose-dependently enhanced the expression of JAM-A in, MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly metastatic breast cancer cell-line, as determined by Western blot analysis. The growth factors also caused the 231 cells to change their morphology and made them more hexagonal rather than long, spindle-like in shape. The effect of EGF on cell invasion was studied in an invasion assay, where it was found that EGF dose-dependently hinders breast cancer cell invasion, possibly due to the increased expression of JAM-A. In conclusion, anti-hormonal therapies, although effective at reducing primary breast cancer growth, are inducing breast cancer cell invasion, which is the hallmark and most dangerous part of breast cancer cell metastasis.

THE BEST OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE AGAINST HEARTBURN.
Zelwyn Zadiel Figueroa
Arsenio Martinez, Aguada PR 

Heartburn is a common problem in society. Selection of over the counter medications is an every day alternative for people. The purpose of this research was to determine if antacid D was as effective for HCL solution neutralization as it proved to be for soda, apple juice and white vinegar. The hypothesis is that antacid D in liquid form is the most effective one to neutralize the 0.75M HCL solution which is similar to stomach acid. The investigator prepared a solution of HCL with a concentration of 0.75M that had a very similar pH to the one of the stomach acids. Six antacids (3 in liquid form and 3 in tablet form) were used for the neutralization of the HCL solution samples. The pH was measured before and after pouring the antacid. The neutralization process was timed. Three identical trials were made. The results of the research demonstrated that antacid D in liquid form is the best over the counter medicine against heartburn. Antacid D neutralized all the selected solutions in less time than other antacids did. It is also one of the most economical over the counter medicine in the market against heartburn.

STUDY OF THE AFTERNOON NOURISHING HABITS OF ADOLESCENTS BETWEEN 15 TO 20 YEARS OLD FROM BERWIND SUPERIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY OF BARRIO COLO
Yanis Michelle Romero-Quianes
Berwind Superior High School, San Juan, Puerto Rico

This investigation was about the nourishing habits of adolescents. The purpose of the research was to determine if what young people eat is healthful. The hypothesis under study was that if adolescents have a balanced diet in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, then they have healthful nutritional habits. This was studied through the evaluation of an eleven questions questionnaire and a journal about their eating habits. A sample of thirty (30) adolescents of both sexes between the ages of 15 and 20 years old answered the questionnaire and maintained a journal where they recorded what they ate between 4:30 pm and 9:00 pm during a five days period.<br><br> The analysis of the obtained data demonstrated that most adolescents have unhealthful nourishing habits. They do not eat foods that have a balance in the content of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. They do not know how to make a decision between good tasting junk food and healthy food. Only one adolescent from the sample under study used to balance her nutrients because of a health condition. All the other ones did not keep a balanced diet. The conclusion was that most adolescents do not have healthy nutritional habits.<br><br>

THE REACTION OF THE DIFFERENT PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN THE PRESENCE OF ANTISEPTICS, ANTIBIOTIC, MEDICINAL PLANTS AND ANTISEPTICS COMBINED WITH ANTIBIOTICS IN THE PROCESS...
Zuleyka M. Rivera-Marrero
Luis Llorens Torres High School, Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this research was to investigate if an antiseptic in combination with an antibiotic was more effective to heal an wounds than an antibiotic or medicinal plants. The hypothesis was that the use of the antiseptic or medicinal plants were not going to be as effective as the use of antiseptic in combination with the antibiotic. Different tests were performed. First test: a set of five test tubes each containing six pieces of raw beef meat was used. Six drops of different antiseptics were added to four of the test tubes and the fifth one had water to be used as control. Second test: the same procedure was used but using one antibiotic together with the same antiseptics used before. The fifth test tube, the control one, had only antibiotic. Third test: three test tubes were used with a different medicinal plant in each one. Color and smell were used as indicators wounds of healing. It was found that the combination of antiseptic and antibiotic was the most effective one. Kirby Bauer method was utilized with six pathogenic bacteria. (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum, Vibrio anguillarum, Rhodospirillum rubrum ). For each bacteria, 0.5 ml of each of the antiseptics were added. The same procedure was used with the antiseptic together with the antibiotic and with the medicinal plant extracts. Observations were done after twenty-four hours. Hydrogen peroxide in combination with the triple antibiotic was the most effective alternative in this research to heal a wound.

DYNAMIC HERD IMMUNITY THRESHOLD MODELING
Nathan Thomas Georgette
Allen D. Nease High School, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL; United States of America

The purpose was to develop a novel dynamic population parameter-based model for the herd immunity threshold as opposed to the predominately used fixed model. The researcher solved the SIR compartmental epidemiological model. The researcher created a dynamic model for the basic reproduction number (which quantifies infectiousness) and substituted it into the fixed model, incorporating changing population parameters to more accurately calculate the herd immunity threshold dynamically: <br><br>V_T>[P_o-I-R]-(I+S-P_o)/ln(S/P_o) where V_T=fraction of population needed to be immunized during outbreak to achieve herd immunity, R=fraction of population recovered, S=fraction susceptible, I=fraction infected, and P_o=initial fraction susceptible. The partial derivative of V_T with respect to R was found. The dynamic model was implemented to analyze three measles outbreaks to determine its efficiency. P_o, S, I, and R were calculated with data from articles about the outbreaks. For the 2006 Fiji outbreak, the dynamic model showed that the threshold (threshold=.91) was lower than the WHO fixed estimate (threshold=0.95). For the peak (week 6, 2000) of the 2000 Sri Lanka outbreak, the dynamic model threshold (threshold=.952) was greater than the fixed estimate (threshold=.938). For the 2003 Marshall Islands outbreak, the dynamic model (threshold=.855) at peak (8/20/2003) was much less than the fixed target (threshold=.93) due to immunization programs. The researcher determined the partial derivative <br><br>( V_T/ R)<0 for the duration of all outbreaks. As R increases, V_T decreases. The dynamic model more accurately calculates V_T and shows that programs expediting recovery are advisable to decrease V_T. The fixed model sometimes under-approximates V_T, which can prolong outbreaks.<br><br><br>HAND WRITTEN FORMULA -- use hard copy for abstract book.

EVALUATION OF CONCUSSION RISKS IN TEEN SPORTS
Nicholas Samuel Greos
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO, United States of America

Records of 962 high-school athletes were studied; of these subjects 168 received a concussion during the season. This study resulted in the identification of several risk factors, which were successfully correlated to an increased likelihood of receiving a concussion: higher weight, not repeating a grade, hyperactivity problems, and learning disabilities. Athletes who were heavier were shown to have an increased likelihood of concussion. Those who repeated a grade were one-fourth as likely to experience a concussion during play. Athletes diagnosed with a hyperactivity problem were twice as likely to receive a concussion compared to those who were not diagnosed with the problem. Athletes with learning disorders were shown to be almost four times as likely to suffer a concussion. Interestingly, athletes with two or more risk factors are six times as likely to experience a concussion. This study suggests that athletes with one or more of the factors identified may benefit from counseling to be particularly cautious or to reduce participation in contact sports. With this knowledge, coaches and parents across the nation can evaluate the risks faced by individual students and can attempt to prevent or reduce these injuries.<br><br>

CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF PLECTRANTHUS AMBOINICUS LEAF EXTRACTS ON ARTEMIA SALINA NAUPLII AND HUMAN LUNG CANCER CELLS
Shyam Sathyamoorthi
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA

An investigation of the anticancer potential of the Lamiaceae herb Plectranthus amboinicus revealed that the methanol extract residue of its leaves was cytotoxic to Artemia salina (brine shrimp) nauplii and human lung epithelial carcinoma cells-A549. <br><br> It was hypothesized that if leaf extracts were cytotoxic to brine shrimp nauplii, then their toxicity would increase with increases in dosage levels. It was predicted that those extracts that were significantly toxic to brine shrimp nauplii with LC50<50µg/mL (concentration leading to 50% lethality) would also be cytotoxic to human lung cancer cells. When methanol, ethyl acetate, phenolics, and aqueous extract residues, and fresh juice of leaves were screened for brine shrimp toxicity, only fresh juice and methanol extract residue were significantly cytotoxic with LC50 <50µg/mL.<br><br> Cytotoxic effects of fresh juice and methanol extract residue on human lung cancer cells were studied with A549 cell viability assay. Hydrogen peroxide was used as positive control for toxicity. Reductions in survival fractions analyzed by Student's paired t-test were considered statistically significant if P values were less than 0.05. Unlike fresh juice (LC50 >380µg/mL) which exhibited significant toxicity only at concentrations > 200µg/mL, methanol extract residue (LC50 =152µg/mL) showed statistically significant cytotoxicity at all test concentrations ranging from 50 - 200µg/mL. It was nearly a tenth as toxic as hydrogen peroxide, a potent cytotoxin. Experimental findings agreed with predictions.<br><br> Further investigations are required to isolate the active components from the crude extract and study their effects on normal and cancerous cell lines to confirm the exciting preliminary findings.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF PROGESTERONE ON ISCHEMIC BRAIN INJURY IN SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WITH PERMANENT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION
Tahseen Ismail
Hillsborough High School, Tampa, Florida, USA

Progesterone (PROG) is a neurosteroid that has been found to have a possible future in stroke treatment. Recent studies have established a link between progesterone treatment and a decreased volume of cerebral infarction after a middle cerebral artery occlusion, or transient stroke. This study aims at testing the effects of progesterone on ischemic brain injury after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in the rat model. The study involved 16 Sprague- Dawley rats, 8 of which were placed into a progesterone treatment group and treated with progesterone one hour after experiencing a permanent stroke, and the remaining 8 rats placed into a vehicle group, where they received a vehicle one hour after experiencing a stroke. The rats were studied for 72 hours after the surgery, during which functional capability tests were administered (whose results were compared to an initial test given before the stroke surgery) at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. After 72 hours, the rats’ brains were analyzed to calculate the total infarct volume. The progesterone treated rats fared much better than the vehicle treated rats, as the pMCAO + PROG rats produced a lower mean infarct volume percent and a higher mean percent of regained functional capabilities than the rats who only received a vehicle. This is very promising for the future of progesterone as a treatment for stroke.

PROBING FOR AGING GENES IN HUMANS
Dave Raj Praharaj
Grissom High School, Huntsville, Alabama, USA

Through this project, homologous regions of different aging genes from a few organisms were analyzed using a variety of bioinformatics software. Two aging genes from the mouse were chosen. Using NCBI BLAST and GenBank software, homologs of these two genes were found as a result of the search in other organisms including the human being. Then, the nucleotide sequences of the homologs were analyzed by using them in a multiple alignment using ClustalW software, from which a consensus was taken. The consensus was once again analyzed using BLAST software to find its protein sequence homologs. Once again, the homologs included a possible human gene. Just to assure that the particular human homolog is closely related to the mouse aging genes, a multiple alignment of the protein sequences of the mouse aging genes and its homologs were taken. From this, the human homolog was indirectly proved to be related to aging by understanding and probing its role in the human body using TIGR software. Finally, proposals on how to directly prove, through laboratory experiment, that the human homolog is an aging gene and how to regulate aging to increase lifespan in the genes were put forward. Some of the experimental protocols in the proposal include such items as PCR, gene splicing, and gene silencing.

CONFIRMATION OF CELLULAR DEATH IN TAXOL RESISTANT CELL LINES 2008/17/4 TREATED WITH ONO3100
Prashanth Shanmugham
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach FL, United States of America

Taxanes have beaen in usage in chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer, due to their unique method of inhibition. However, cells become resistant to the taxane of interest, Paclitaxel. This is due to the overexpression of Multi-Drug Resistant Protein Pump which transports the Paclitaxel outside of the cell through ATP from hydrolysis. With cells becoming resistant to the Paclitaxel applied, ONO3100, a molecular compound a non-ATp inhibitor, is used in conjunction with Paclitaxel, or Taxol to kill cells. In order to confirm the synergistic cellular death in 2008 and 2008/17/4 cells in the conjugated application of Taxol and ONO3100, the cell lines 2008 and 2008/17/4 were first checked for the presence of MDR, to insure that the cell line 2008 had the presence minutely, and 2008/17/4 had an overexpression of the protien, inidicating its resistance to the drug Paclitaxel. Two control cell lines, MESSA, which is resistant to Taxol, and MESSA Dx5, which is Taxol Resistant, were run along with 2008 and 2008/17/4. After checking for MDR, the two lines were grown at various dilutions, and were then treated with ONO3100 and Taxol at different concentrations. After a three day incubation, the cells were counted for viability. The Taxol Resistant cell lines, 2008/17/4, showed synergistic cellular death when Taxol ON03100 were used in conjunction. It can be concluded shows when Taxol and ONO3100 are applied together to 2008/17/4, Taxol and ONO3100 work in conjunction to kill the resistant cell line, showing synergistic interaction between the two compounds.

Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, Florida, United States

The purpose of this project is to conduct a longevity study on Caenorhabditis elegans without sterilizing the test subject; waiting until the organism is in its post-reproductive stage before experimentation; and investigating the effects of different genetic strains (N2, old-1, eat-2), in combination with the administration of nutraceuticals (resveratrol, kinetin, EUK-134). <br><br>It is hypothesized that EUK-134 in combination with the eat-2 strain of C. elegans will have the greatest positive effect on the longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans.<br><br>To test the hypothesis, thirty-six Caenorhabditis elegans, past their reproductive stage at five days old, are sorted into three groups of twelve Petri dishes, one C. elegans per dish. One group contains strain N2; the second group, strain old-1; and the third group, strain eat-2. Three out of the twelve Petri dishes from each of the three groups receive 50 PPMs (parts-per-million) of EUK-134, three receive 50 PPMs of resveratrol, and three receive 50 PPMs of kinetin. The remaining Petri dishes are the controls. The number of days each worm lived was recorded. If the Petri dish becomes overcrowded with offspring, the adults should be transferred to a new Petri dish or the offspring are cauterized.<br><br>The results partially supported the hypothesis. The eat-2 strain experienced increased longevity by 62%. The N2 and eat-2 strains experienced an additional 60% increase in longevity when administered kinetin. Resveratrol and EUK-134 did not increase the longevity of the C. elegans.<br><br>Future studies may include testing on Drosophila melanogaster, administration of nutraceuticals such as lectin and catalase, and a greater variety of genetic strains.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF STRUCTURE AND EFFECT OF DISEASE-CAUSING MUTATION Y532H ON THE ROLE OF ATP7B IN COPPER METABOLISM
Katrina Anne Diaz
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA

Wilson’s disease is a copper metabolism disorder caused by two mutant ATP7B genes. It is hypothesized that missense mutation Y532H in the N-terminus of the Wilson protein (ATP7B) destabilizes the structure and interferes with several different mechanisms. The main objective of this project is to characterize the molecular basis of this disease-causing mutation. <br><br> The Y532H mutation was incorporated into the native recombinant gene. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli, extracted and purified. Copper-binding studies were performed to test whether the mutant protein is able to bind copper in the same way as the native form. The stability of the mutant protein versus the native protein was analyzed by unfolding the protein, monitored via circular dichroism spectroscopy. The protein was also isotopically labeled with NMR-active isotopes to facilitate high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. <br><br> The average mass of the mutant was 16,022 Daltons, smaller than that of the native at 16,048 Daltons. Copper binding studies indicated that the mutated Y532H protein binds copper similarly to the native protein. Circular dichroism studies indicated that both the native WD5-6 protein and the mutant Y532H have very similar secondary structures and experience similar stages of unfolding. <br><br> Copper binding and secondary structure seem largely unaffected by the mutation. This is potentially because the location of the mutation is between domains 5 and 6, far from the copper binding sites. Its effect on the protein’s overall function may be blocking communication between domains according to the mutation’s location, thus preventing synchronization of domain activity, causing an alteration in the way copper is transferred between domains or disrupting the network of atomic contacts between domains. <br><br>

METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE II (MAT II): A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN THE INDUCTION OF APOPTOTIC DEATH IN LEUKEMIC T-CELLS
Aditya Shirish Barve
duPont Manual High School, Louisville KY, USA

Methionine adenosyltransferase II (MAT II) is a key enzyme in cellular metabolism and catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) from L-methionine and ATP. MAT II and SAMe, the critical methyl donor, are essential for T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Normal resting T lymphocytes have minimal MAT II activity, whereas, activated proliferating T lymphocytes and transformed T leukemic cells show significantly enhanced MAT II activity. Hence, the present work was carried out to examine the effect of MAT II inhibition on the survival of leukemic T cells. MAT II enzyme activity was inhibited using a specific competitive inhibitor, cycloleucine. Inhibition of MAT II and the resultant decrease in SAMe levels enhanced expression of FasL mRNA and protein and induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in these cells. Furthermore, blocking MAT 2A gene expression, which encodes the catalytic subunits of MAT II, using a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) approach enhanced FasL expression and cell death. Since DNA methylation is involved in the inactivation of the transcriptional induction of FasL and caspase-8, it is highly likely that the MAT II inhibition-mediated decrease in the methyl donor, SAMe, restored the transcriptional activation of both FasL and caspase -8 leading to apoptotic death of leukemic T cells. Significantly, MAT II inhibition did not affect the survival of normal lymphocytes, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target for the induction of Fas-mediated apoptotic death in T leukemic cells.<br><br>

GROWTH INHIBITION OF METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: EFFECT OF METHANOLIC EXTRACTS FROM VARIOUS NUTS
Micah Maetani
Kamehameha High School-Kapalama, Honolulu, HI, United States

Recent studies have shown that walnuts contain trace amounts of melatonin, a hormone produced in the pineal gland, which has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of almond, macadamia nut, walnut, and pecan extracts on the growth of LNCaP (prostate) tumor cells. Nuts were extracted in methanol and standardized to concentrations of 50, 35, 15, and 5 mg/mL. Cells were treated with nut extracts and growth was measured through an SRB dye-binding assay. Walnut and pecan extracts significantly (p 0.05) inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells. Extracts were fractionated in a solvent system consisting of 50% methanol 50% ethyl acetate with two drops of acetic acid per ten mL of solution, and fraction 2 of both the walnut and pecan extract exhibited a significant (p 0.05) growth-inhibiting effect on the cells. Concurrent treatment with the walnut or pecan extract and luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, showed that the active compound responsible for inhibiting cell growth is not melatonin or melatonin-like. Neither -tocopherol nor melatonin cochromatographed with fraction 2 of the walnut or pecan extract. The walnut and pecan extracts, as well as fraction 2 of both nuts, were found to induce apoptosis in the LNCaP cells. These data indicate that walnuts and pecans contain an as of yet unidentified compound that inhibits prostate cancer cell growth.

PREVENTING EPIDERMAL CELL DAMAGE BY THE SUN: A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF SUN SCREEN, EGCG, AND VITAMIN A.
Lissi Lisbet Welton
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, Arizona, USA

Damage created by the sun, (UV rays) causes skin cancer. It is also a well-known fact that the rate of skin cancer is increasing in our nation and that sun screen is one of the main methods for blocking UV rays. Armed with this knowledge, it was hypothesized that plant leaves protected by sun screen would suffer the least amount of damage when exposed to natural and artificial UV-B light. In contrast, EGCG and Vitamin A applied to the leaves would offer no protection from UV-B light. Two control plants and twelve experimental plants were coated by recognized cancer fighting compounds (vitamin A and EGCG) as well as sun screen and were periodically exposed to 45 milli-joules of UV-B light for one month. Leaves from the exposed plants were harvested and analyzed form cellular change using microscopy. Cellular degradation of the epidermis and parenchyma was evident in the leaves treated with sun screen. Leaves coated with the EGCG exhibited a healthy epidermal layer and increased growth in the parenchyma. The vitamin A leaves showed less degradation in the epidermal layer and mixed results in the parenchyma. These results suggest that EGCG and possibly vitamin A should be further researched as means to protect skin from harmful UV rays.

SECOND YEAR STUDY: THE SIGNALING PATHWAY THAT CONTROLS BODY WEIGHT
Katherine Yuan Fang
Pioneer High School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

Leptin is an essential hormone in humans and rodents that suppresses appetite and controls body weight. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increases leptin sensitivity in hypothalamus neurons. BDNF is known to phosphorylate its tyrosine receptor TrkB. It has been hypothesized that this allows Src homology 2-betta (SH2B) to bind to TrkB and induce neuronal differentiation triggered by BDNF. The purpose of my experiment was to test if the 701 tyrosine on TrkB is vital for neuronal differentiation.<br><br> Two cell lines, wild type and mutated TrkB transfected PC12 cells were used. The mutated TrkB was mutated on the 701 tyrosine site. Samples from both cell lines were either left untreated, treated with BDNF, or treated with Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and observed under a microscope. <br><br> BDNF stimulated neuronal differentiation in wild type TrkB cells at a much higher rate than in the mutated TrkB cells. Also, the average length of axons in the wild type cells was significantly longer than in the mutated TrkB cells, after BDNF treatment. However, when both cell lines were treated with NGF, they had similar rates of neuronal differentiation. <br><br> The results show that the 701 tyrosine on TrkB is vital for neuronal differentiation to occur. The binding site of SH2B and TrkB must be at the 701 tyrosine. This new understanding of leptin and BDNF's downstream signaling pathway has potential to lead to a future treatment for obesity.<br><br>

PHOTODYNAMIC REACTION TO PHOTOSENSITVE PORPHYRINES, (BPB IN DENTAL PLAQUE) IN-VITRO
Devon Elisa Pryne
West Jones High School, Laurel, MS, United States of America

<br><br> The objective of this study is to determine the photosensitive of Black Pigment Bacteria (BPB)in dental plaque associated with destructive periodontitis to the halogen blue light. BPB's consist mainly of organic compounds called porphyrines. Porphyrines are photosynthetic and when activated by halogen light induce a photodynamic reaction that kills the micro-organism. <br><br> Caulk Max halogen light, which is issued in most dental offices, was used in this experiment with wave lengths ranging from 380 to 520 nanometers. Blue light is perceived through three flavin- containing photoreceptor families: crypto chromes, light oxygen voltage and BLUF. This study was conducted to compare the ability of the blue light to determine different working lengths on the reduction of BPB’s. Dental plaque samples were retrieved from twenty human subjects that have been diagnosed with periodontitis with pocketing over 5 mm and no prior treatment in the last 4 months. Survival fractions were calculated by counting CFU’s before and after exposure to light. <br><br> The specific of this study was that the halogen blue light could achieve a rapid and selective elimination of oral endogenous porphyrines a gram positive species. Particle wavelengths of a blue light eradicate pathogens within minutes. Elimination occurred when BPB become excited and produce a reaction from the oxygen called singlet oxygen from the air. This study represents an important step forward in the prevalence of periodontitis. <br><br>

BE NICE GIVE YOUR HAIR A DRINK YEAR 2
Brittany Lauren Key
Glen Rose High School, Glen Rose Arkansas, USA

This project is the result of experimentation on the effects of hot oil treatments on different types of human hair. The idea for the research originated with from the need to solve my own problems with very dry hair. Purchased hot oil samples and self prepared vegetable oil formulas were tested on different hair colors and textures.<br><br> Oil saturation and retention by the hair was determined by inserting hair samples into the heated the oil then retrieving and measuring the excess oil that was not absorbed by the hair. The absorption test was repeated at different specific oil temperatures for each hair color sample. Also, varied soaking times were tested for each oil and hair sample. <br><br> I hypothesized that the coarser the hair the more hot oil the hair sample would absorb, absorb and that the hotter the oil sample, the more the hair would soak up. I also predicted that the vegetable oil home made samples would be absorbed less readily by the hair than the over the counter purchased oil samples.<br><br> The results of this experiment were as predicted. All hair samples absorbed purchased hot oil samples better than the self prepared vegetable oil recipe. Also, the coarser lighter colored hair soaked up more oil than the darker colored slicker hair. In conclusion, I would advise people who suffer from dry hair problems to purchase VO5 hot oil treatment because it works the best at all temperatures and on all hair types.<br><br>

DIET, EXERCISE, TOBACCO, ALCOHOL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF BREAST CANCER
Joshua Sean Murphy
Savanah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia, USA

Breast cancer is the number two cause of cancer death among women in North America, affecting one out of every eight women. Recently, data have emerged in the medical literature linking breast cancer risk with certain dietary and environmental variables. This experiment was a retrospective, case-control, survey-based study that compared the dietary intake of meat, vegetables and fruit and the utilization of tobacco and alcohol between women with breast cancer and women without breast cancer. The hypothesis was that patients with breast cancer (BrCa+)would have a higher incidence of "high-risk" environmental factors than the non-breast-cancer patients (BrCa-).<br><br>The study involved the development of a one-page questionnaire on breast cancer risk factors, including family history, height and weight (used to calculate body mass index, a measure of obesity) and questions about alcohol intake, tobacco use and weekly consumption of fruit, vegetables and meat. A total of 670 questionnaires (370 cases and 300 controls) were mailed after being compiled randomly from two physicians' office databases. All data were collected anonymously. Roughly 58% were returned from each group. The results were then placed in an Excel spreadsheet and the data were analyzed for determination of statistical validity.<br><br>CONCLUSION: No significant difference between the BrCa+ and BrCa- patients was seen with regard to the abovementioned environmental parameters of diet, ethanol or tobacco use.

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED LEVELS OF GLUCOSE ON THE RESPONSE OF BLOOD VESSELS
Rachael Nicole Mattingly, Ayesha Diamond Crockett
duPont Manual High School, Louisville Ky, United States

As of present, many people have been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus. More commonly known as Type 2 diabetes, diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder in which cells in the body don’t respond correctly to insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and breaks down the glucose that one consumes and converts the glucose into energy. Because of this abnormal response to the insulin sometimes a patient can develop high blood sugar levels since the glucose doesn’t break down. This experiment focused on determining whether increased blood glucose levels affected the response of the blood vessels. Using Sprague-Dawley rat tissue, the thoracic aorta was examined while it was exposed to phenylephrine, which causes contraction, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside, which both cause the aorta to relax. Thoracic aorta rings were exposed to the regular blood glucose levels (100 mg/100 mL), twice the regular amount, or quadruple the amount in an in-vitro tissue bath. For survival during the experiment, the thoracic aorta was exposed to conditions similar to that of the human body using a Physiological Salt Solution. It was hypothesized the aorta segment that was exposed to quadruple the amount would contract the most and relax the least. After the experiment was conducted, it was concluded that there was the most contraction with phenylephrine of the thoracic aorta ring that was exposed to quadruple the regular amount. When it came to the acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside there was no significant difference between the blood vessels over the amount of relaxation of each aorta ring.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR DIABETES MELLITUS THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF MULTIPLE GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS AND INSULIN COMBINATION THERAPIES TO KERATINOCYTES
Jared David Scholato, Danielle Donnelly
Cocoa Beach Junior Senior High School, Cocoa Beach, Florida, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine an enhanced approach to treating diabetes by testing different glucose concentrations and insulin combination therapies. Only certain insulins may be utilized in combination treatment regimens. Determination of ideal combination therapies may decrease the total number of hypodermic injections a diabetic takes daily; thereby reducing stress, and costs.<br><br> Human keratinocytes were cultured at a local research institution. Twenty-four flasks were sub-cultured for each trial. Each experimental group consisted of three flasks. The groups were: Control, Novolog, 70/30 (70 % Human Insulin Isophane Suspension and 30 % Human Insulin Injection), Regular, Lantus; and the combinations Novolog-70/30, Novolog-Regular, and 70/30 Regular. Every flask received 10 microliters (1 unit) of the designated insulin(s). The flasks were incubated for four hours with the glucose level taken every 15 minutes. For glucose concentration trials, there were three flasks for each of the five experimental groups and the control group. A glucose solution concentrated to 1mg/10 microliters was used to inoculate the flasks with from 1 to 5 mg of glucose. <br><br> It was determined that all insulin and glucose variations had a statistically significant difference in glucose level compared to the control (p<.001). Over a four hour period, the insulin combination therapies showed a greater change (-1.93->-2.83mg/dL), in comparison to the other experimental insulin groups (-1.29mg/dL). The glucose trials rates of change ranged from 2.3->13.25mg/dL. The results from the insulin combination therapies demonstrated that there is a possibility of reducing the number of shots a diabetic takes daily.<br><br>

METHYLATION IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA IN RELATION TO THE IL-6 PATHWAY
Farhana Hana Ahmed, Natalie Thoni
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to design a therapeutic process in which Multiple Myeloma patients can be treated. Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of the bone which makes up about 1% of all cancer cases diagnosed. Much of the baseline work is still unknown, so the first goal was to determine how the cell lines grow under differential conditions. The cell lines were grown by standard cell culture in which the cells were fed and cared for after cryopreservation and defrosting. Then growth of Multiple Myeloma cell lines were measured with an MTT assay with every combination of the variables IL-6 and anti-IL-6. RTPCR was performed to observe the expression of IL-6. <br><br> The results of experimentation were that the three cell lines of U266, Kas, and RPMI expressed IL-6 in the following ways: U266 makes its own IL-6, Kas is dependent on IL-6 to be given to it in the media, and RPMI is rather odd because it seems to have a separate cell signaling pathway apart from the extracellular receptor, allowing expression or no expression to fluctuate with no observable pattern. These results indicate that IL-6 profoundly affects the growth of Multiple Myeloma cells. Hence, these results indicate that combining anti-IL-6 with other chemotherapy agents might optimize the treatment of Multiple Myeloma. <br><br> <br><br>

SINGLE AGENT AND COMBINATORIAL THERAPY OF PACLITAXEL, CISPLATIN, AND CARBOPLATIN INHIBIT HUMAN METASTATIC MELANOMA CELL PROLIFERATION AND PROMOTE APOPTOSIS
Gregory Thomas Kennedy, William Powell Kennedy
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine what, if any, combinatorial effect the chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel, cisplatin, and carboplatin had on the inhibition of cellular proliferation and promotion of apoptosis in the metatstatic melanoma cell lines A375 and MeWo. Dose responses of the drugs on each cell line were determined using a cell proliferation assay of various concentrations of each drug plated. The inhibitory concentration of each drug that killed 50% of the number of cells in the control plates (IC50) was determined. The IC50 was used in another cell proliferation assay to determine if the agents in combination inhibited cell growth more than the individual agents. The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin inhibited proliferation by 66.81% and the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin inhibited proliferation by 57.33% in the MeWo cell line. Both combinations were statistically significant as compared to the drug that inhibited the highest concentration of cells. The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin inhibited cell proliferation by 71.35% and the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin inhibited cell proliferation by 65.15% in the A375 cell line. Only the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel was statistically significant. Apoptosis of the treated cells was determined using an apoptosis assay with DAPI stain. The combinatorial therapy was not statistically significant over the most effective single treatment. The data supports that the combinations of cisplatin and paclitaxel and carboplatin and paclitaxel have a combinatorial effect on cell proliferation. Although these trials need to be repeated many more times both in vitro and in vivo, they show promise that one day combinations of these drugs may help to fight melanoma.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECTS OF CREATINE MONOHYDRATE AND PANAX GINSENG ON MUS MUSCULUS. YEAR 2
Nicholas Matthew DeVillers, Timothy Richard Fresonke
Perham High School, Perham, MN, US

In concurrence with prior research, it was hypothesized that Panax ginseng would show an increase on the body growth, general appearance and general activity level of Mus musculus, while the substance Creatine Monohydrate would actually decrease growth rates in the larger administered amounts and would increase the aggression levels. The goal of this research was to find whether these supplements had more of a positive or negative effect on live animals. After gathering the needed materials, the experimentation began by separating the Mus musculus into groups of five. For each group, the amount of supplement the Mus musculus would be given was calculated, and then mixed into their water supply. On a daily basis, the weight of each group was measured and recorded. Unbiased researchers were brought in to monitor and fill out surveys on the activity levels, general appearance and aggression levels of the Mus musculus. The final conclusion of the research supports the hypothesis. In all amounts, Panax ginseng showed an increase in body growth, with the highest effect at its recommended dosage. Meanwhile, Creatine Monohydrate increased body growth in the lower amounts, while hindering it in the higher dosages. The Mus musculus being administered the Creatine Monohydrate were monitored as being more aggressive than those given the Panax ginseng. Also the Mus musculus which were given the Panax ginseng showed a better activity level and overall better appearance.

THE EFFICACY OF DISINFECTANTS IN THE HEALTH FIELD
Thanh-Truc Thi Nguyen, Christine Pham
Benson Polytechnic High School, Portland, Oregon, United States

As future medical professionals, we know the risk of an exposure to common bacteria found in hospital settings. This motivates our interest in looking at the effects of disinfectants on bacteria. The most commonly contracted bacteria are: E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. We used five types of disinfectants: 10% bleach solution, 50% bleach solution, Purell, 70% ethanol solution, and Alcare Plus foam. At first we cultured the bacteria and LB broth, which provides nutrients for the bacteria to grow. Then we isolated each bacteria in order to plate it onto five petri dishes. A sterile filter paper was placed inside each petri dish. The five different disinfectants were then applied onto their own paper for each type of bacteria. All 15 petri dishes were placed in the incubator for overnight growth. When we took out the plates, the effects of the disinfectants were visible. Overnight, the bacteria continued to grow; however, the area of the sterilized filter paper, where the disinfectants were applied, was clear. Depending on the type of disinfectants, results varied from effective or ineffective. We measured the diameter of the clear circle and recorded the results. The most effective disinfectant was the 50% bleach solution. Out of all five, the weakest disinfectant appeared to be Purell, barely producing any effect. This research enabled us to see how powerful the bacteria were in their production and how limited the selection of available disinfectants.

Jan Pierre Crespo, Monica Gonzalez
Academia Nuestra Senora de la Providencia/San Juan, Puerto Rico/ Puerto Rico

The benefits of a new nasogastric band were determined in terms of the benefit for the epidermis of the patient. The new nasogastric tubing with a locking device will be sufficiently resistant, in order to serve as a holder of the nasogastric tube. It also helps prevent the complications that this tubes cause to the epidermis. This effects are caused by the bands used today made of gauzes and adhesives.<br><br>This band will be able to modify the medicine practices. It will hold the nasogastric tube and serve as alternate equipment for other medical procedures. At the same time, it will give the necessary protection in order to avoid displacement, necrosis by pressure and the lacerations of the skin among other things.<br><br>

ISOLATING NEW ALLELES OF A C.ELEGANS GENE, APL-1, THAT ENCODES A PROTEIN SIMILAR TO HUMAN APP
Karishma Rahman, Guang Yu Lee
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY, USA

As people live longer, an increasing number of people are experiencing the deteriorating effects of Alzheimer’s disease. The brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients are characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid plaques, whose major component is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The function of human APP is unclear. Therefore, it is important to develop a model system in which we can study APP related-genes. We used Caenorhabditis elegans as a genetic model to examine the function of an APP-related gene, apl-1. Loss of apl-1 results in larval lethality, indicating that apl-1 is essential for viability and development of C. elegans. To identify essential domains within APL-1, we performed mutagenesis screens to isolate new alleles of apl-1. By finding more information about the functional domains within APL-1, we can gain insight into the functional domains of human APP. 1885 haploid genomes have been screened for possible mutations in apl-1 and 6 candidate alleles were identified. These candidates were examined to determine whether they corresponded to new alleles of apl-1 or to recombination events. All 6 possibilities were determined to be recombinants. The experimental ratio of recombination is much greater than the expected rate of recombination in the apl-1 locus, suggesting that the locus is located in a recombination hotspot or that the location of the locus is incorrectly assigned. We will continue with our mutagenesis screens to isolate new alleles of apl-1 and when one is isolated, its molecular lesion will be determined by DNA sequencing.

EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS STRESSORS ON THE BODY FAT STORAGE AND CONTENT OF INVERTEBRATE MODEL ORGANISMS DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Whitney Strine Quackenbush, Erin D'Agostino
Manhasset High School, Manhaset New York, 11030

Scientists across the country suggest that obesity is a national epidemic. Could stress be the culprit? Hormones released in the stress response favor increased intake of food and specific nutrients like fat, which may lead to weight gain. (Reinhard 06). This study evaluated the effects of chronic and short term stress on metabolic rates and fat storage in drosophila and C. elegans. In drosophila chronic stress was induced via sleep deprivation, and short term stress via heat shock; the effects of each were measured through body fat storage and content, metabolic rates and locomotion. N2, Sod-1 mutant, and Sod-5 mutant strains of C. elegans were oxidatively stressed using 6.2 Mm of t-butyl hydroperoxide; body fat content was observed through sudan black staining and quantitatively measured by luminosity tests, and body fat storage was measured using time to starvation trials. The alternate hypothesis suggests that with an increase in various forms of chronic (sleep deprivation) and acute (heat shock) stress in drosophila, and oxidative stress in C. elegans, body fat storage and content will increase, specifically in Sod-1 and Sod-5 mutant strains of C. elegans. In drosophila, multiple trials demonstrated that sleep deprivation and heat shock caused a decrease in locomotion, fat storage, and body fat concentration and an increase in metabolic rates, rejecting the alternate hypothesis. However, in C. elegans statistical analysis confirmed a significant increase in both body fat storage and content with exposure to oxidative stress in the Sod-1 and Sod-5 mutant strains, supporting the alternate hypothesis. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF GENISTEIN AND QUERCETIN ON LONGEVITY AND SUPPLEMENTATION OF STRESS PROTEIN FUNCTION IN GENETICALLY SUPPRESSED C. ELEGANS
Luis Lafer-Sousa, Devin I. Marmel
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX, U.S.A.

Age-related research has confirmed that high concentrations of radicals and the absence of antioxidants constitute a major cause of aging. An organism’s response to oxidative stress is to synthesize proteins that counter the damage. Synthesis of stress proteins both use energy, and are linked to many neurodegenerative diseases. The introduction of antioxidant compounds can efficiently supplement the cell’s defense by neutralizing radicals. Studies have shown that flavonoids possess the capacity for extreme antioxidant behavior. The purpose of this project was to analyze the extent to which genistein and quercetin, two flavonoids, can replace the role of proteins in the defense against the stress of a hyperoxic environment. Groups of C. elegans were exposed to Sod-2, Ctl-2, or Daf-2 RNAi. Along with a wild type, these groups were grown in ambient oxygen levels with or without an initial exposure to a hyperoxic environment. C. elegans plates contained genistein, quercetin, or no supplement and lifespan was recorded. Genistein and quercetin effectively replaced the role of some proteins, suggesting a treatment for protein-related diseases, yet other proteins were essential to maintain a normal lifespan. Decreased lifespan after hyperoxic shock and increased lifespan after inhibiting the Daf-2 gene suggested that lifespan is controlled by both external damage and programmed internal processes. In conclusion, inhibiting the body’s own costly mechanisms and replacing their functions could offer treatments for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Finding the genes related to aging and the chemicals that most readily prevent oxidative stress could lead to increased lifespan in humans.

THYMOL EFFECT ON THE COMPOUND ACTION POTENTIAL OF THE SCIATIC NERVE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH LIDOCAINE ACTIVITY
Samuel Veloso Pinheiro, Giovanni Iury Martins Pontes
Colegio Christus, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil

Plant extracts and plant-derived agents have been very important sources of medicinal agents to pharmacotherapy. Thymol is a phenolic substance with oil characteristics present in many medicines sold over the country for human uses. It is an important constituent of the essential oil of many plants largely used in popular medicine of Brazilian Northeast, such as Lippia gratta, Lippia sidoides and Thymus vulgaris. Since it is known that many essential oils have local anesthetic activity, the goal of the present research was to investigate whether thymol blocks the peripheral nerve excitability and has anesthetic properties. <br><br> The nerve was transversely positioned inside a humid chamber half filled with Locke nutrient solution, with a segment (17-20 mm) immersed in this solution. It was stimulated at the proximal extremity and the compound action potential (CAP) was registered at the end. Thymol and lidocaine concentration from 60-2000 µM were employed. The electrophysiological parameters analyzed were peak-to-peak, velocity conduction, chronaxy and rheobase of CAP. After 180 minutes nerve exposure to thymol or lidocaine, CAP parameters were depressed by both agents, but the effect at a given concentration was more intense for thymol as compared to lidocaine. We conclude that thymol is a local anesthetic agent with a pharmacological potency potential greater than that of lidocaine.<br><br>

DETECTING CANCER IN LIVING TISSUE WITH SINGLE-CELL PRECISION
Alex Shlomo Ramek, Adam Chaplin Fields
HAFTR HS, Cedarhurst, NY, USA and Jericho HS, Jericho, NY, USA

Effective detection of cancerous cells embedded in normal tissue is essential for the improvement of cancer-targeting treatments and early-stage cancer detection systems. However, conventional methods of detection of cancer require large numbers of cells, and conventional cancer treatments are indiscriminate, destroying many normal cells along with cancerous ones. Two novel techniques were developed and tested for the detection of cancer cells in a mixed tissue environment. Shear Modulation Force Microscopy (SMFM), using an atomic force microscope (AFM), was utilized to measure the mechanics of normal and cancerous karatinocytes plated on silicon with polybutadiene (PB) 2500 angstroms in separate and mixed tissue environments. A clear distinction was made among the moduli of several cancerous and normal cells in the mixed culture, and, via comparison to the normal and cancer controls, a significant bimodal distribution in relative modulus was shown. This technique may prove to be an effective early cancer cell diagnostic system. Additionally, surface plasmon resonance, using BIAcore 2000, was utilized to demonstrate the preferential adhesion of silica micro-beads to the membranes of prostate cancer sells and SCC cancerous keratinocytes as compared to those of normal cells. Confocal microscopy was also utilized to evidence further and image the preferential adhesion of the micro-beads, which were now impregnated with green fluorescent dye, to the cellular membranes of cancerous cells. These fluorescent beads may prove to be useful as both a cancer diagnostic, and, because they are hollow, they may be used for cancer-targeting drug delivery.

COGNITIVE DEMAND ON THE POSTERIOR CINGULAR CORTEX IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AN FMRI STUDY
George Guo, Martin Mata
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA

Schizophrenia is a form of psychosis associated with a withdrawal from reality, illogical thought patterns, delusions, hallucinations, and most significantly, a dysfunctional working memory network. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the brain, the center of the working memory (WM) network, has been studied extensively, but this was the first study investigating the relationship of the WM and resting networks of the brain. The resting network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), is activated during rest, but suppressed during task performance. This research was designed to identify a relationship between the working memory and the resting networks in performing a working memory task, and also to associate the effects of schizophrenia with a dysfunction in the working memory or resting network. Using fMRI and statistical analysis, two important findings were reached regarding the role of the WM and resting networks. This research established a functional relationship between the right DLPFC and the PCC, and secondly, provided evidence demonstrating that the left DLPFC is damaged in brains of people with schizophrenia. These findings may serve as a major advancement toward what could be a major diagnostic tool for schizophrenia, and may lead to the development of better treatments for schizophrenia.

The project, in its current form, is a continuation of the project entitled, "The Effect of Toothpaste and Toothbrushes on Stained Teeth." In the current experiment, the variables were changed to include the effect of pressure on the usefulness of toothbrushes and toothpaste on stained teeth. The purpose of this experiment was to determine which types of toothbrushes and toothpastes were the best for removing dark stains on teeth using varying amounts of pressure.<br><br>One hundred tiles were obtained and divided into groups of twenty. Each of these tiles were then soaked in five different liquids- coffee, tea, red juice, soda and cocoa for an hour. They were removed and allowed to dry for eight hours. During the first trial, a 10 gram weight was added to the toothbrushes. During the second trial, a 30 gram weight was added and, during the third trial, a 50 gram weight was added to the toothbrushes. Each tile was then compared to a tooth shade color chart labeled one through ten. The results were recorded in tables and on graphs.<br><br>The conclusion drawn from this experimentation was that pressure made very little difference on the whitening outcomes. As a result, the hypothesis was proven to be incorrect. Toothpaste can help in the removal of stains and they can whiten teeth. Some brands of toothpaste have more whitening agents in the formulas than others. Regardless of the brand of toothpaste or amount of pressure, combined the practice will both whiten and remove stains.<br><br>

A STUDY OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IN A CROSS-SECTION OF WOMEN
Rachna Beeravolu Reddy, Elizabeth Wells Busdicker
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI, USA

VitaminD reduces the risk of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and is vital to bone and muscle health. We studied the prevalence of vitaminD deficiency in our county and evaluated the variation of vitaminD levels by age, BMI, and season. We also tested the effectiveness of a vitaminD supplement on improving muscle aches in vitaminD deficient women. <br><br> The prevalence of vitaminD deficiency in 200 women age 45 and older from July 2006 to January 2007 was 49% (25-OH-D < 30 ng/mL). We compared vitaminD levels between elderly and younger women, summer and winter months, and obese and non-obese women. While there was no significant seasonal or age variation in vitaminD levels, obese women had significantly lower vitaminD levels than non-obese women (27.03 ± 12.11 vs. 32.23 ± 13.56; P=0.0076).<br><br> Seventeen vitaminD deficient women were questioned about the number and severity of their muscle aches before and after taking a vitaminD supplement for four to eight weeks. There was a significant decrease in both the number (5.96 ± 5.47 vs. 1.13 ± 2.13; P=0.003) and severity (7.17 ± 1.59 vs. 3.13 ± 2.6; P=0.0005) of muscle aches after supplementation. <br><br> Our study shows that vitaminD deficiency is a highly prevalent problem in all women age 45 and older, regardless of season, with significantly lower levels in obese women. The supplementation of vitaminD improves muscle aches. The widespread health issue of vitaminD deficiency and the positive implications of vitaminD supplementation should be extensively communicated to the public. <br><br>

THAT'S NOT FOOD ON YOUR FORK INVESTIGATING THE BACTERIA COLONIES FOUND ON UTENSILS AT DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS
Dylan Brown Curtis Brown, Rachele Brown
Bonney Lake Highschool, Bonney Lake Washingto, USA

The purpose of our project was to see what style of restaurant had the most bacteria on their utensils. We chose four different styles of restaurant: buffet, family, fine dining, and pre wrapped from a fast food restaurant. In the first trial, we tested hand washed utensils and used that as the control group. for the second, third, and fourth trials we changed our control group to an untested Petri dish. This control was used to prove that the incubator and Petri dishes were clean and bacteria from one sample weren't contaminating other samples. Also in the second, third, and fourth trials, we added utensils from the dishwasher. For each sample we tested one fork and one knife. Before the utensils were used, we opened the Petri dish just far enough to get the utensil in and touch the utensil to the Petri dish gel. After the samples were collected, they were place in an incubator for four days at 37 degrees Celsius. At the end of each day, the samples were photographs and colonies and the colony number was recorded. Whiling leaving the Petri dishes sealed, we examined the bacteria and compared their form, elevation, and margin. We also looked at the colonies with a microscope to examine colony shape. In both the first and second trials the fine dinning restaurant had no bacteria growth and the buffet had the most bacteria growth. Our control in the second trial had no bacteria grew on it. We accepted our hypothesis.

The purpose of our project was to see what style of restaurant had the most bacteria on their utensils. We chose four different styles of restaurants: buffet, family, fine dining, and pre-wrapped plastic from a fast food restaurant. In the first trial, we tested hand-washed utensils and used that as the control group. For the second, third, and fourth trials we changed our control group to an untouched Petri dish. This control was used to prove that the incubator, agar and dishes were clean and bacteria from one sample weren't contaminating other samples. Also in the second, third and fourth trials, we added utensils from the dishwasher. For each sample we tested one fork and one knife. Before the utensils were used, we opened the Petri dish just far enough to get the utensil in and touch the utensil to the Petri dish gel. After the samples were collected, they were placed in an incubator for four days at 37 degrees Celsius. At each day, the samples were photographed and the colony number was recorded. While leaving the Petri dishes sealed, we examined the bacteria colonies and compared their form, elevation, and margin. We also looked at the colonies with a microscope to examine colony shape. In both the first and second trials the fin dining restaurant had no bacteria growth and the buffet had the most bacteria growth. Our control in the second trial had no bacteria that grew on it. We accepted our hypothesis.

COLOR VISION

Wilde Lake High School, Columbia, Maryland, USA

In this project we wanted to find out what colors are the hardest for people to perceive. Originally, we tested how well people see colors from a distance of 20 feet. We then took the project one step further and experimented in what environment (indoor light and sunlight) people could perceive colors and color vision in various display devices.<br><br>All participants were tested at a standard distance of 20 feet from the test object because that is a universal method to test vision. The object was a picture of a flower with yellow in the center of the flower and red, black, dark blue, orange, brown, pink, purple, and green as the petals and green in the stem and leaves. These colors were based on earlier work by others on color vision. <br><br>Our hypothesis was that brown, pink and purple would be the hardest to perceive. After our experimentation, we approve of our hypothesis because brown, pink, and purple were the hardest to perceive. Out of 26 trials, only 11 people perceived pink correctly, brown was perceived correctly by 10 people, and only 13 people perceived purple correctly.<br><br>We did this project because we are looking into the field of optics and vision for a future career choice. We want to devise displays for the color-impaired by finding out which colors are the hardest to perceive and finding effective ways to transmit the color information to vision-impaired people.<br><br>

SEARCH FOR A CURE

In our experiment, we tested the claims of an old Indian remedy, and its effects on the blood sugar levels of mice. In our project, we used twenty female mice and tested them for a total of six weeks. We tested each mouse's blood sugar levels with a human glucometer twice a day, once before they were fed, and once two hours after they were fed. The mice were tested a total of three weeks on control, or without anything added to their diet. Then we introduced greasewood, in a tea form, to the mice diet. The mice were then tested in the same manner as before, checking blood sugar twice a day, three times a week.<br><br> We believed that there would be a significant decrease in the mice's blood sugar when the greasewood was introduced to their diet. There was a decreased in the mice's blood sugar levels, though it was not as drastic as we first believed it would be. The overall average of the blood sugar levels of the mice, in the first round of testing before the mice were fed, the blood sugar levels stabilized and decreased. While the blood sugar levels of the mice, in the second round of testing, after they were fed, was still unstable. Our results were inconclusive even though our hypothesis was correct in the first round of testing. We are doing further testing on the chemical properties of greasewood and its chemical effects on blood sugar levels.<br><br>

PREVALENCE OF S. AUREUS COLONIZATION IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Cullen Spencer Marshall, Joseph Delward McMillan
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

Staphylococcus aureus, and more importantly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), has become a threat to the community because it can cause invasive infection. However, people can be colonized with S. aureus without developing disease. This project tested the hypothesis that many healthy high school students are colonized with S. aureus, and that some of the strains are resistant to methicillin or other antibiotics. Also, certain hypothesized risk factors were analyzed.<br><br> The anterior nares of 71 high school students were sampled with moistened swabs. These were used to inoculate culture plates that were incubated overnight. Colonies showing characteristics of S. aureus were confirmed by latex particle agglutination and suspended in defibrinated sheep’s blood for storage. These isolates were later retrieved and tested for antibiotic susceptibility using microbroth dilution.<br><br> It was found that 14 of the 71 students (19.7%) were colonized with S. aureus, and only 2 of these isolates (14%) were MRSA. Seven of the methicillin-susceptible isolates showed no resistance to any of the antibiotics analyzed. One MRSA strain was resistant to 3 classes of antibiotics. No risk factors were statistically significantly related to colonization. However, living with a healthcare worker approached significance, with a P-value of 0.13. The study may have been limited by a small sample size.<br><br> S. aureus colonization is common among high school students, probably because they are in close contact with each other. MRSA colonization may not be as common as hypothesized because spread in the Louisville community may just be starting.<br><br>

THE SKINNY ON DIET PILLS: TESTING 4 PRESCRIPTION APPETITE SUPPRESSANTS ON THE TOXICITY & HEART RATE OF VARIOUS CRUSTACEANS.
Sara Kaye Melton, Ashlyn Summer Reynolds
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, United States of America

Many times people do not take the side effects of prescription appetite suppressants seriously. The testing of the suppressants on brine shrimp toxicity, ghost shrimp heart rate, and ghost shrimp toxicity, may magnify the effects and may be looked at more seriously.<br><br> The brine shrimp toxicity test was performed in order to determine the specific level of solution to use on the testing of the ghost shrimp heart rate. The ghost shrimp heart rate was performed by looking through the ghost shrimps clear shell and counting the heartbeats for 15 seconds and multiplying it by 4 to receive the beats per minute.<br><br> The hypothesis was that Benzphetamine would have the highest level of toxicity and have the greatest change in heart rate. The hypothesis was supported. Benzphetamine did in fact have the highest toxicity level. Lower percentages of solution were used in the ghost shrimp heart rate test due to Benzphetamines' toxic ability. Even with the lowest percentage of solutions Benzphetamine 0.001% had the highest increase of heart rate and Benzphetamine 0.01% had the greatest decrease of heart rate. However, in the ghost shrimp toxicity test Benzphetamine actually stimulated the shrimp, but Phentermine and Diethylpropion had the lowest survival rate. Every drug had some sort of effect on the heart rate or life span of the ghost shrimp and brine shrimp. People may now choose for themselves the safest suppressant based on this experiment.<br><br>

CAN WE MAKE THE BIO-ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS OF MOBILE PHONES MEASURABLE?
Ahmet Faruk Kavak, Ali Coskun
Private Fatyh Science High School, Istanbul, TURKEY

Adverse health effects of electromagnetic waves are known by people, but still many of them aren’t supported by experiments. The only proven effects of mobile phones are thermal effects and influences and interferences on the electronic implants used for health issues. To our knowledge, this is the first time in our project we tried to prove another bio-electromagnetic effect of mobile phones; pH change and amylase enzymatic activity modifications.<br><br>Mobile phones produce electromagnetic fields, not more than a hairdryer, but still in a considerable amount. Concerns about so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health. Theoretically the health hazards are possible but there are not proven practical observations about its acute health effects. The chronic exposure effects to be observable still requires more time we guess. But still there should be some acutely observable effects of mobile phone usage around us that we wanted to show in our project that there is really. Our project makes a model in vitro experimental system to show electromagnetic effects on living organisms using amylase enzyme on starch digestion.<br><br>

EVIDENCE OF SENSITIZATION TO FUNGI IN PERSONS EXPOSED TO PIGEON (COLUMBA LIVIA) EXCREMENT. PHASE IV
Legna Marie Figueroa-Cosme, Darlenne Marie Torres-Cordero
Superior Urbana High School Patillas, Puerto Rico

The purpose of phase IV was to investigate the possibility of fungal sensitization in persons exposed to the contamination of pigeon (Columbia livia) droppings. Having this in mind, the hypothesis was that with the skin prick test the sensitization to fungi found in phases III and IV would be evidenced. <br><br> The investigation was divided in three parts; Questionnaires: these were administered to twenty-seven of the persons exposed to the contamination of pigeon droppings. Microbiological Analysis: samples from four contaminated schools were taken and analyzed to confirm fungal growth. Skin Tests: these tests were performed on sixteen of the persons exposed to the contamination. <br><br> The allergenic fungi isolated through the microbiological analysis in phases III and IV were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporiun, Aureobasidium pullulans, and Wallemia sebi . These have been documented to be responsible for the following conditions: allergies, hypersensitive pneumonitis, allergenic mycotic sinusitis, and infections of the respiratory and urinary tract. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed a significant increase in the following conditions: sinusitis (200%), nasal allergies (500%), itching of the nose (800%), throat discomfort (500%), frequent cough (600%), skin allergies (1,100%). The skin tests were negative, not evidencing the sensitization to fungi. It is important to know that these skin tests have a poor reliability. These present a high predictable negative value (80% to 100%) and a low predictable positive value (less than 50%). This suggests that the diagnosis must be confirmed with serological tests with specific allergens considering the clinical history of individuals exposed to the contamination. <br><br>

C1Q BINDING PROTEIN AND SEX HORMONES IN USING AUTOIMMUNITY TO FIGHT CANCER
Richie Kimlong Huynh, Ryan Kimlong Huynh
Champlin Park, Champlin, Minnesota, USA

Autoimmunity could be a powerful force against cancer if manipulated. The C1q protein initiates the complement cascade, an autoimmune response, but C1q also prevents the complement-cascade from attacking tumor cells. Sex hormones have been shown to influence autoimmunity. This research first aims to assess the effects of C1q binding-protein (C1qBP) on C1q function and second to assess how sex hormones affect C1q production. <br><br> The C1qBP gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into vectors. Plasmids were transformed into bacteria; colonies were incubated. After plasmid purification, gene sequencing verified molecular insertions in plasmids. Plasmids were transformed into bacteria for protein expression. C1qBP were cloned, sonicated, purified, and dialyzed. Complement-Hemolytic-Assay (CH50) tested C1qBP for inhibition of C1q function. Supernatants and intact pellets from the assay were analyzed with spectrophotometer and microplate reader, respectively; analyses with both human and mouse C1qBP showed that C1qBP partially inhibited C1q activity. Future studies may aim to fully inhibit C1q function with concentrated C1qBP. This can allow autoimmunity to target tumor cells. C1qBP has great potential in research, treatment, and gene therapy. <br><br> Dendritic cells, which produce C1q, were prepared and isolated into two groups. Estrogen and progesterone were applied to one group at 50 nM/mL. RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and gel-electrophoresis found no effect on C1q RNA production; ELISA tests analyzed amounts of C1q proteins produced in the supernatant of the dendritic cells. The ELISA showed that sex hormones approximately doubled the C1q production. This could partially explain why females are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION ON STEM CELLS
Philip Joseph Narkiewicz-Jodko
Klamath Union High School, Klamath Falls, OR

GOAL: The goal of this project was to observe the behavior of the KG1a cell line and adult stem cells under chronic inflammatory (CI) conditions.<br><br>BACKGROUND: Adult stem cells (ASC) are undifferentiated cells found in the body that can generate multiple cell types. In the body they divide and migrate to replenish dying cells and repair damaged tissue, travelling from the blood to the tissue. The widely accepted opinion today is that ASC are attracted to areas of inflammation. Chronic Inflammation is a condition with widespread (i.e. non-local) inflammation, including the blood stream. <br><br>CELLS: The KG1a cell line is immortalized from a human donor with acute myelogenous leukemia, derived from the bone marrow and of myeloblast morphology. A subpopulation containing human ASC were harvested from whole blood by gradient centrifugation.<br><br>METHODS: Two methods were employed two assess two different parameters involved in cell migration: a) immunophenotyping for three surface markers involved in chemoattraction and adhesion (CXCR4, CD62L CD49d), b) cell migration using double chamber plates. Cells were either left untreated or exposed to a source of inflammatory mediators (inflamed plasma) for 15 minutes. <br><br>RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: ASC showed diminished receptor expression of CXCR4, CD62L, and CD49d by 51%, 48%, and 7%, respectively. KG1a showed decreased expression of the same receptors by 32%, 15%, and 9%, respectively. These results indicate that migration of ASC from blood to tissue may be diminished in a chronically inflamed environment, limiting the body's ability to repair damage to heart and other tissue in times of need.

THE ACHY BREAKY HEART OF DAPHNIA
Adrika Venkatanaryanan
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The focus of this project was to observe how over-the-counter allergy medicines affect the heart. Since I have mild allergies, I wanted to know how the medicines I take affect my heart rate. For this project I used Ceriodaphnia dubia (Daphnia magna) as my experimental organism. I exposed the Daphnia to four different conditions: a control, Children’s Benadryl Allergy Liquid, Equate Allergy Relief and Actifed Cold and Allergy at a concentration of 1 mg/ml of water. The Daphnia were set in the said concentration in 10 ml for 15 minutes. Each daphnia’s heart rate per minute was then examined and recorded carefully.<br><br> Due to the mixture of antihistamines and decongestants in allergy medicines, I expected heart rate of Daphnia to accelerate causing tachycardia (rapid heartbeat). However, after analyzing the data, I learned that Benadryl caused an average of 23% decrease in the heart rate, Actifed caused a decrease of 18% and Equate Allergy relief medicine decreased the heart rate by a mere 2%. Based on these observations, my hypothesis was rejected that across the counter allergy medications induce tachycardia in my chosen experimental model of Daphnia, although literature suggests that allergy medications cause rapid heart-beat in humans. This disparity as observed in Daphnia is partially explained due to the different physiological make-up of the two hearts. Humans have a myogenic heart while Daphnia have neurogenic heart. It might be beneficial to use other antihistamines and compare the drugs to see if they behave similarly to those observed in humans.

SAND-EATING: AN INVESTIGATION IN WELCOM AND THABONG
Mamokone Mirriam Lelimo
Welkom Gimnasium, Welkom, Free State, SOUTH AFRICA

The purpose of my research was to investigate the phenomenon of sand-eating in Welkom (a small town based on gold mining) and Thabong ( the adjacent high-population density area populated by black people, in the apartheid era known as a township). I am a sand-eater. I investigated people in the black community who eat sand in terms of gender and age; the age when sand-eating started; what influenced people to start; medical problems; myths about sand-eating and preferred types of sand. I hope that my research can help educate and inform both the public and health-care professionals. The attitude of secrecy around the phenomenon makes research challenging.<br><br>I designed a questionnaire that was answered by 26 sand-eaters; they formed the base of my sample. I structured the questionnaire so that, as much as possible, the information could be presented graphically. I listed information regarding myths and sand preference. I compiled several case studies. I conducted a literature search. I presented my findings at a local clinic.<br><br><br>In the community I studied, sand- eaters are mainly black females. Most are influenced by family or friends. The reasons for geophagia are many and mysterious. Geophagia is difficult to treat because of the gap between the world of the sand-eaters and the medical fraternity. More research is needed, particularly into the phenomenon of the malabsorption of iron. The silence around sand-eating needs to be broken, information about the phenomenon needs to made available to health-care professionals.

EFFECTS OF CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID ON HUMAN COLON CANCER
Donald Kyle Jones
The Villages High School, The Villages, FL

The purpose of this project is to investigate the anticancer effect of CLA on a human colon cancer cell line and establish whether or not CLA could be used effectively as a cancer preventative agent in humans or as chemotherapeutic agent. I hypothesize that CLA will kill the colon cancer cells in a dose dependent manner because of its proven anti-inflammatory properties.<br><br>A 1 to 20 dilution of CLA was performed by adding 500 micro-liters of CLA to 10 mL of media to form a 50 micro-molar CLA solution. A similar procedure was performed to make a 100 micro-molar CLA solution and a 200 micro-molar CLA solution. Next, twenty thousand cells were placed in 24 well plates containing medium with 10% fetal calf serum. All samples were done in sixes and two groups of samples were set up (one to be examined after 24 hours of incubation the other after 48 hours). One group of six wells served as the control, and the other three groups of six wells were used for each of the three different concentrations of CLA. Cell viability was examined using a Cell Titer Glo assay after the two time periods.<br><br>The cell viability assay proves that my hypothesis was correct and CLA does kill colon cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. The cells that were incubated for 24 hours showed up to 50% cell death and the cells incubated for 48 hours resulted in about 95% cell death.

SWEET SUCCESS: A FIELD TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSUMING XYLITOL-SWEETENED SPORTS DRINKS IN SUPPRESSING THE ORAL COLONIZATION OF STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS BACTERIA IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Christine Elizabeth Johns
Evangelical Christian School, Fort Myers, FL

Between 2000 and 2006 the worldwide consumption of sports drinks increased by 83% to $7,500,000,000 in total annual sales. Widely used by athletes, even as young as 5 years old, to assist with hydration after physical activities, recent research has indicated that these sports drinks may cause increased colonization of oral bacteria leading to tooth decay. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of consuming xylitol-sweetened sports drinks in suppressing the oral colonization of Streptococcus mutans (SM) in high school students. The study began with randomly assigning 36 high school students to three study groups to daily consume 946ml of: water (group A), fructose/sucrose-sweetened sports drink (group B), and xylitol-sweetened sports drink (group C). A tryptone-yeast-cystine agar plating method was used to isolate and measure the growth of SM bacteria growth four times during the 40-day study period. The water students showed on average a 3.3% decrease in SM levels, the fructose/sucrose students experienced a 64.1% increase in SM bacteria, and the xylitol students had a decrease of 26.9% in SM levels. Statistical analysis of this data using a series of paired t-tests indicate that daily consumption of fructose/sucrose sports drinks results in a significant increase (p<0.05) in oral SM colonization, whereas daily consumption of xylitol-sweetened sports drinks significantly decreases (p<0.05) oral SM colonization. This data suggests that drinking a xylitol-sweetened beverage may serve to inhibit the colonization of SM in the mouths of high school students, thus reducing their risk of experiencing tooth decay.

IS THERE AN EXTANT FREQUENCY OF TRISOMY 8 AND P53 DELETION IN CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA PATIENTS AT DIAGNOSIS?
Shuang Xu
Paul Laurence Dunbar, Lexington, KY

Chromosome analysis is the current technique for classifying Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis. Normally, 20 metaphase cells are examined for the diagnostic translocation, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2). This study uses fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine 250 interphase cells and metaphase cells for enhanced detection of trisomy 8 and/or p53 deletion. Detection of the additional abnormalities would change classification of the patient’s disease from chronic to accelerated and alter the treatment approach. <br><br> <br><br>Slides containing blood or bone marrow cells from newly diagnosed CML patients and normal controls hybridized with DNA probes D8Z1 and p53 were analyzed by chromosome microscopy to determine the presence of trisomy 8 and/or p53 deletion. The slides were read blindly to eliminate bias. After reading the slides, the nature of each slide (patient/control) was revealed, and the data was analyzed.<br><br>8 of 15 patients showed a frequency of trisomy 8 above the 99% confidence level (0.40%), and 7 of 15 patients showed a frequency of p53 deletion above the 99% confidence level (1.74%). The frequencies for all normal controls but one fell below the 99% confidence level, which is expected and demonstrated the reliability of my reading. <br><br>The initial results are promising. FISH detected trisomy 8 and/or deletion p53 in 11 of 15 newly diagnosed CML patients not found by chromosome analysis. The data suggest that FISH should be performed in addition to chromosome studies because a significant percentage of patients would be reclassified as having accelerated disease.

THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF TASTE ON PAIN
Erica Leah Von Stein
Lakewood/CAT High School, St. Petersburg, FL

Long-standing evidence confirms altered taste in cancer survivors commensurate with radiation therapy, and it is proposed that such damage in taste perception is associated with increased pain, subsequent to the loss of inhibitory influences of taste on pain. This study expounds on preliminary findings by utilizing a dose response methodology to determine whether intensity or palatability of various flavors has significant effect on previously observed pain inhibition. Fifty-four healthy adults were administered heat stimuli with and without simultaneous taste stimuli. A baseline was determined by the temperature at which subjects report moderate pain, without concurrent taste stimuli. Participants randomly received taste stimuli consisting of various concentrations of bitter and sweet, as well as de-ionized water, which served as a neutral stimulus. It was hypothesized that intensity and palatability would differentially influence pain response: as the intensity of the taste increases, the pain perception would decrease. Concurrent to prior studies, this data confirms that pain response is altered in the presence of taste stimuli in adult human subjects. Having any taste stimulus in the mouth, participants report a higher temperature as moderate pain than compared to baseline (all P- values < .005). For women, the highest concentration of sweet and median concentration of bitter are associated with higher temperature ratings than water (all P- values < .005), indicating pain inhibition. Men, however, exhibit no significant difference when comparing inhibitory effect of any of the solutions to water (all P- values > .05). These results suggest significant gender-specific trends in pain inhibition corresponding to intensity; however, an association between palatability and inhibitory effect remains ambiguous.

WATER! DEAD OR ALIVE?
Katessa Ann Karch
Canadian High School, Candian, OK

Water is the most important resource on the earth and the universe. In my experiment I wanted to find out if my samples had bacteria and if so how much. Health is very important to me and everyone else. The water samples I collected were five bottled spring waters, tap water from two cites, three samples were taken from water fountains and cafeteria of a school, one bottle purified water and distilled water. From my previous year’s experience, I hypothesized that spring water was more likely to have bacteria than other sources of water. My hypothesis was correct. The spring waters did have bacteria in them. My source (the Oklahoma water testing center), states that any colonies of bacteria makes the water unsafe. The only part that did not support my hypothesis was the lunchroom faucet being the one with the most bacteria and could have been because of bacteria on the faucet not in the water because the other two samples from Canadian had no bacteria. People with lower immune systems could die from coliform bacteria, which poses a great health threat.

ALLEVIATING DIABETES PROBLEMS: THEORETICAL TREATMENTS, INSULIN RESISTANCE, AND NANOTUBE DEVICES, YEAR THREE
Jared David Scholato
Cocoa Beach Jr/Sr High School, Cocoa Beach, FL

Novel approaches to eliminating everyday problems associated with controlling insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were investigated. A previously derived theoretical treatment (TT) using two types of insulin was expected to increase efficiency of controlling glucose levels. Also, an alternating insulin regime (AIR) was expected to reduce insulin resistance (IR) because the insulin receptor makes conformational changes to accommodate the differing hexametric insulin structures. Oxidizing the carbon nanotubes (CNT) differently was expected to cause the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) and fluorescent insulin protein (FIP) to immobilize in greater concentration, increasing the longevity of both biosensors. <br><br> Human keratinocytes were cultured at a local research institution; flasks were subcultured for two experiments. <br><br>The TT,<br><br> <br><br><br><br>, from a previous study was tested against commonly used insulin regimes to treat IDDM. The build-up of IR was tested using an AIR through flow cytometry analysis, samples fixed in paraformaldehyde by laboratory staff. Different oxidative methods allow CNT’s ring structures to break, causing the CNT’s to functionalize, allowing GOx and FIP to immobilize. Glucose titrations were used to determine the longevity. A 1mV current was run through the completed CNT circuit, which allowed FIP to be released, as quantified by hemacytometer. <br><br> The TT was shown to work more efficiently at controlling glucose levels, P<.001, when compared to all other treatment groups. IR built up in every treatment, however, the AIR showed the least amount, P<.001, when compared to all other regimes. Resistance decreased when CNT’s were oxidized, but increased when FIP or GOx was added, indicating immobilization.

THE EFFECT OF POLYMORPHIC ALLELES FOUND IN THE NPPA AND NPRA GENES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASTHMA
Jason Lewis Marks
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether polymorphic alleles on the NPPA and NPRA genes have individual influence on Asthma development and/or whether they interact with each other to determine a stronger association with the disease. Based on preliminary statistics from a previous examination that suggested an association between Asthma and an NPPA genotype (rs5063), it is hypothesized that other polymorphic alleles on NPPA and its receptor, NPRA, will also reveal an influence on Asthma development, which is more statistically significant. Methods include polymerase chain reaction, to produce specific template material and amplify the desired coding region from DNA samples received from asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients, and LightTyper probe analysis, to determine the identity of the nucleic acid at the sequence location which is being examined. Numeric data will be derived from the results of the LightTyper analysis, organized in regard to whether the sample is asthmatic or control, the race of the individual, and the presence, or lack thereof, of the single nucleotide polymorphism. An NPRA genotype (rs9661993) was amplified in a total of 432 asthmatic samples and 240 control samples before it was processed with the LightTyper machine. The collected data was analyzed in the Chi Square method with two degrees of freedom. The rs9661993 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was not found to have a statistically significant relationship with asthma and, therefore, does not support the hypothesis. Other NPRA SNP’s (rs6427005, rs7541193, and rs7543790) are undergoing analysis and results are pending.

PREVENTING ROTATOR CUFF INJURIES
Kimberly Ann Branham
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

The purpose of this project was to build a brace which relieves pressure from the rotator cuff tendons, yet still permits full mobility. Many young athletes suffer from rotator cuff injuries and other prevention methods, such as taping, are very costly and time consuming. Furthermore, surgery for rotator cuff tears is extremely costly and has a long period of recovery time. To build the brace, two taping diagrams were looked at to determine where to place the straps and spread out the pressure. Next, straps were connected to a 32cm x 38cm neoprene triangle which contained an inner triangle of plastic canvas covered by a foam triangle layer. The brace is placed over the shoulder with the point opposite the long end pointing towards the neck. The straps connected to this same tip ran down the front of the body and down the back which connected to a nylon strap around the waist. Also, a strap was placed around the arm at the base of the triangle. Range of motion was then tested using a protractor. First, the degree of movement was found without the brace on, which was 150°. Second, the degree of movement was tested with the brace on, which was 135°. Therefore with the brace on, only 10% of mobility is lost. The experiment determined a brace is feasible to build, and you can still have the majority of the shoulder’s mobility. Phase II will be testing the brace on athletes to see if it prevents injuries.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF CYTOKERATIN 8 EPITOPE LT-11 ON HUMAN PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMAS AND NORMAL TISSUE
Sesheta Benu Mwanza
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

This project evaluated whether cytokeratin 8 epitope LT-11 (CK8), an intermediate filament protein involved in cell division and cell movement, is an effective tumor marker for pathological analysis using immunohistochemistry. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a strong detection CK8 in tissue denoted the presence of cancer. Changes in the location of CK8 were seen as the tissues became malignant and less differentiated. <br><br>Ten pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 12 normal pancreatic tissue specimens were obtained on a tissue microarray. After tissue preparation, an antigen retrieval step and inactivation of endogenous peroxidase activity were done to reduce background staining. The tissues were incubated in chicken anti LT- 11 antibody and subsequently in fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Mounting medium with DAPI was then applied for a counter stain. Each tissue was given a score of 1-4 based on staining intensity and CK8 levels seen through a fluorescence microscope. A score of 3 or 4 equaled strong detection. A two proportion z test supported the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between the detection of CK8 on tumors and normal tissue (p= 0.7713). However, differences were observed between the location of cytokeratin in the cancerous and normal tissue. Malignant tissues had sporadic placement of CK8 throughout the tissue while normal tissues had CK8 centrally placed around the exteriors of acinar cells. These results may support studies which suggest that CK8 plays a role in metastasis. Cytokeratin 8 imaging is a possible method of diagnosing the stage of cancer.

EVALUATING SLEEP HYGIENE: EMPOWERING TEENS TO TAKE CHARGE
Elliot Erika Aliina Prince
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

Inadequate sleep hygiene (health) is a significant problem for high school students. Sleep research shows that when teens are prescribed sleep schedules with attention to regularity and total sleep time, daytime sleepiness declines. The problem is: without continued prescriptions, subjects return to baseline sleep hygiene. This study aims to determine whether sleep hygiene education can affect teen sleep behaviors. The hypothesis was: if daytime sleepiness is reduced in a controlled study by prescribing sleep schedules, then this effect will be maintained after the study in a group which receives sleep hygiene education. Two manipulations (prescriptions and education) of sleep-wake schedules and total sleep time were evaluted on measures of sleep hygiene in two groups, control (received prescriptions only) and experimental (received both). Nineteen willing freshmen were selected for study based on reported daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Subjects kept sleep-wake diaries for three 10-day periods (7 school days, 3 free days) and recorded sleep habits. Comparisons were made between baseline (usual schedules), regulation (prescribed schedules), and follow up (self-selected schedules). Outcome measures supported the hypothesis. Compared to baseline, mean total sleep time was increased and daytime sleepiness was reduced for both groups (regulation); further improvements were seen in the experimental group measures at follow up compared to the control group which returned toward baseline. This is a first study which demonstrates sleep hygiene education as an effective treatment for sleepy teens. These findings support inclusion of sleep hygiene education in high school science curricula.

ARYLSULFATASE B ASSAY FOR MPS VI AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS: A CONVENIENT AND SENSITIVE APPROACH
Prithwis Kumar Mukhopadhyay
Lake Junior High School, Woodbury, MN

Deficiency of Lysosomal Enzyme Arylsulfatase B causes fatal hereditary diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, Valvular Heart Disease, and Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome. Arylsulfatase B is also significant because it contributes to maintaining balanced cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. A growing understanding of Arylsulfatase B’s physiological importance has increased the demand for precise and affordable testing in clinical and research fields. There are two known testing methods for Arylsulfatase B. Usability is a huge concern for these methods.<br><br>A new sensitive colorimetric microtiter plate assay for Arylsulfatase B was designed, developed, and evaluated to overcome the limitations of existing assays without affecting the precision of the test results. 4-Nitrocatechol Sulfate (pNCS) was used as a substrate and a colorimeter plate reader was used for readings. Arylsulfatase B was tested using a small volume of human lung cell lysates. A standard curve of 4-Nitrocatechol, ranging from 7.8 to 500 nmol/well, served as the basis for the test result. Testing was carried out using two replicates of each sample for multiple samples. The test results were phenomenal. Extensive analysis was performed to validate the test results. Intra-assay and inter-assay analysis revealed negligible test result variation within and across assays. Specificity and precision of the assay was confirmed by sample dilution, exogenous Arylsulfatase B spike recovery, and parallelism between sample and standard dilutions experiments. Moreover, this assay showed high correlation (r=0.96) with the existing ones confirming its accuracy. This newly designed assay is cost-effective too in terms of relatively less test time and less substrate usage.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ANTACIDS ON THE PH OF HCL
Rachel Ann Carson
James Wood High School, Winchester, VA

High levels of HCl in the stomach are the cause of heartburn and acid indigestion symptoms. Over-the-counter antacids can be used to temporarily relieve these symptoms. This is done by neutralization of HCl by alkaline metals found in antacids. My project was designed to test the effectiveness of over the counter antacids in comparison with their costs. <br><br>The effectiveness of the antacids was determined by the change in pH of HCl after one dose of the antacid was added to the solution. After researching the active ingredients, I hypothesized that Rolaids would be the most effective and cost efficient antacid by costing the least amount for each pH level raised. <br><br>After completing the experiment, I found that while baking soda proved to be the least expensive for each pH level raised, Rolaids would be the best choice for an OTC antacid. Consuming excess amounts of sodium bicarbonate can lead to acid rebound, causing the stomach to secrete HCl in higher levels than it had been before consumption of the baking soda. Although it can be used as a short term remedy for acid indigestion, baking soda should not be used on a regular basis.

DIGIT-AL FUTURES: 2D:4D RATIOS AS PREDICTORS OF PSAT SCORES
Gregg Drew Jones
Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School, Arlington, VA

This study examined the relationship between 2D:4D ratios as predictors of Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) scores and cognitive testing. This investigation hypothesized that if subjects reported higher Math than Verbal PSAT scores, and scored higher on the Purdue Visualization of Rotations Test (spatial ability test) than on the Picture Recall and Picture Placement Tests (visual recall ability tests), then they will be found to have low 2D:4D ratios. The 2nd and 4th digits of the right and left hands of 73 surveyed high school students who took the PSAT in October 2007 were measured twice from the crease at the base of the finger proximal to the palm to the tip of the finger, using a digital vernier caliper measuring to 0.01mm. Digit ratios were calculated by dividing the mean result from the index finger by the mean result of the ring finger for each hand. Statistical testing indicated a significant relationship between gender and PSAT scores. Females reporting higher Verbal than Math PSAT scores had higher digit ratios, while males reporting higher Math than Verbal PSAT scores had lower digit ratios. A significant relationship was found between left hand 2D:4D ratios and PSAT score response. Pearson correlations indicated low 2D:4D ratios correlated with high Rotations test scores, while high 2D:4D ratios correlated with high Picture Recall and Picture Placement scores. The hypothesis was partially correct: left hand low 2D:4D ratios were predictors of higher Math than Verbal PSAT scores, and higher Rotations scores correlated with low 2D:4D ratios.

WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN YOUR BABY'S MOUTH? THE EFFECTS OF BISPHENOL A FROM POLYCARBONATE PLASTICS ON LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATUS
Chace Daniel Carver
Merino Junior-Senior High School, Merino, CO

The purpose of this research project was to investigate the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on the regeneration of Lumbriculus variegatus. Bisphenol A was leached from polycarbonate plastic bottles (baby bottles and water bottles) into spring water by either microwaving or boiling the water, or allowing the water to sit in the bottles at room temperature. The researcher cut each of the 39 worms into three sections, head, body and tail, and separated them into the 117 microcenterfuge tubes. The researcher measured the worms every 2 days for 10 days and tracked the regeneration rate of each segment. The data shows that the worms exposed to the water that contained BPA showed slower regeneration when compared to the control group only exposed to spring water. The control worms’ head segments had an overall growth increase of 46.24%. When compared to the experimental groups, almost all of the head segments grew significantly less. For example in baby bottle B, the worms exposed to the water that was boiled had a growth increase of 3.22%, and in baby bottle D in which the worms were exposed to water that was at room temperature had an increase of 3.261% showing that just by being in the bottle and not heated up still affected the worms. The data shows the same trend for body and tail regeneration. Based on this data, the researcher concludes that BPA is affecting the regeneration rate in the worms and could possibly cause harm to humans ingesting the BPA.

EXAMINING THE DEVELOPMENT AND BALANCE OF SULFATION METABOLISM IN THE PEDIATRIC LIVER
Ron Arleigh Cocos Tamayo
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI

During prenatal and childhood periods biochemical defenses are still developing, making children susceptible to toxins. The balance between Sulfotransferase (SULT) and Arysulfatase (AS) may help chemical detoxification or regenerating active chemicals. SULT detoxifies chemicals by making them hydrophilic and AS cleaves sulfated chemicals back to their parent compounds. This balance affects steroid hormones like Dihydroxyepiandrosterone (DHEA) as wells as drugs and chemicals. Little is known on what regulates the activity and development of SULT and AS enzymes in children. Since the liver is a major site for SULT and AS enzyme activities in humans, we have measured SULT and Arylsulfatase A and B levels activities of 24 pediatric liver cytosols (ranging from 13 days to 20 years old) using biochemical assays titrated to provide maximal enzyme activity. We then compared the maximal levels of enzyme activities with children’s age and gender as well as comparing the SULT and AS activities to each other. No significant differences in SULT or AS with age were observed, nor were there any differences between males and females. SULT activity was 15 – 150 times higher than AS and this was a highly significant (P < 0.001, t-test). In children, the balance of sulfation favors detoxification of drugs, dietary compounds and endogenous hormones with much higher SULT than AS activites. Ultimately, further research on the development of detoxification defenses may help us understand the development of diseases such as asthma and cancer as well as adverse reactions to drugs and toxins in children.

IS 4,4' METHYLENEDIANILINE-INDUCED VASCULAR TOXICITY A MODEL FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION?
Dallas James Krentzel
Airline High School, Bossier City, LA

4,4’-Methylenedianiline (DAPM) is a compound used in the production of polyurethanes, which are common in surgical implants, insulation, furniture, and automotive parts. This aromatic compound induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in the pulmonary arteries of female rats, demonstrating symptoms characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is an incurable, fatal disease of the lungs seen three times more often in women than in men. This project was aimed at elucidating the pathways that lead to pulmonary hypertension and determining the relationship between gender and sensitivity to DAPM. Retrospective evaluation of pulmonary vessels was conducted by immunohistochemical analysis for serotonin transport protein, as serotonin uptake is known to induce vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Serotonin transport protein was detected primarily in the pulmonary veins of DAPM-exposed animals, while only modest staining was observed in the arteries, an unexpected discovery. Thus, morphometric analysis was performed on the walls of both the pulmonary veins and arteries. Pulmonary veins displayed a similar wall thickening and vascular smooth muscle cell poliferative response compared to the pulmonary arteries. In conclusion, DAPM seems to initiate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in both the pulmonary veins and arteries, and this effect is correlated with an increase in levels of serotonin transport protein. In vitro trials will be conducted to confirm these results and to illuminate the mechanistic pathways involved.

REACTION TIME TO TOUCH STIMULI VS. BODY LOCATION
James Arthur Iocozzia
Sherwood High School, Sandy Spring, MD

The human body utilizes five methods of sensory perception to interpret its surroundings. Most of these senses are located in the head. Touch, however, is unique; this sense is experienced throughout the body due to a complex nerve network.<br><br>This experiment was designed to gain a greater understanding of the touch nerve network by measuring human reaction time to light-pressure stimuli applied at various body locations. Reaction times were taken at the neck, back, knee, index finger, and big toe of each subject. In the interest of unbiased data collection, each test subject was blindfolded and ear-muffed in order to prevent anticipation of the stimuli and to isolate the subject to their sense of touch. The reaction time were measured by a custom-made stopwatch apparatus.<br><br>The stopwatch apparatus works on the principle of time delay. It contains two synchronized stopwatches, one of which is placed in the subject's hand, and the other is cradled in the apparatus. When the stimulus is applied, the stopwatch in the apparatus is stopped. When a subject senses the stimulus, they stop the watch in their hand. Reaction time is then determined by the difference between the two stopwatches.<br><br>The data collected strongly suggests a relatioship between the location of stimui on the body and reaction time. However, portions of the compiled data were found to be statistically insignificant. This could be resolved by using a larger sample size in subsequent tests. <br><br>Impulse speed from each body location is detailed thourougly in the "Extension" section.

DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIMODAL CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY TO ENABLE RAPID ASSESSMENT OF SKIN CANCER EXCISIONS DURING MOHS MICROGRAPHIC SURGERY
Billy Huang
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

The precise removal of non-melanoma skin cancers is vital for skin cancer treatment. Mohs Micrographic Surgery is the current benchmark surgery for accurately mapping and excising basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Mohs Surgery uses frozen histopathology with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as an intra-operative guide to map out tumor margins and minimize damage to healthy tissue. H&E staining and examination requires 20-45 minutes per 10x10mm excision such that a typical surgery of several excisions requires several hours. The development of a multimodal confocal microscope and feasible fluorescent stain may expedite Mohs Surgery by providing a fast, optical approach to imaging skin excisions. In this study, acridine orange, a fluorescent nuclear stain, was applied to basal cell carcinomas to enhance their contrast for confocal imaging. Concentrations of 0.3 mM and 1.0 mM acridine orange were used to stain skin excisions for (20s, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min). Reflectance mode imaging was completed to enable visualization of normal structures. Corresponding images were acquired in both the fluorescence and reflectance modes of the confocal microscope. These images were assessed with the corresponding frozen histopathology. Results indicate that multimodal imaging offers similar levels of contrast to that of frozen histopathology while cutting down the examination time to 7 minutes, which reduces the overall surgical procedure.

FRACTAL DIMENSION OF FETAL MONITOR TRACINGS REVISITED: TOWARD DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT
Connor Gordon Mulcahy
Whitewater High School, Whitewater, WI

Analysis of electronic fetal monitor tracings has become a standard of obstetrical care. Variability of fetal heart rate on these tracings is considered an important indicator of fetal well-being. Despite its importance, interpretation of variability continues to be subject to considerable inter-observer differences. An emerging approach to heart rate analysis is assessment of fractal dimension. This project was designed to calculate fractal dimensions of multiple areas of fetal monitor tracings to determine whether there are distinct ranges of fractal dimension correlated with fetal heart rate variability defined as either absent/minimal or moderate.<br><br> An on-line case library of electronic fetal monitor tracings was accessed to obtain three actual nonidentifiable patient tracings. Areas of absent or minimal and moderate fetal heart rate variability were identified and confirmed with a physician. Two-minute segments of these areas were selected, then scanned by a computer program utilizing a box counting method to measure fractal dimension. Scanning parameters were selected to maximize accuracy. Fractal dimensions obtained were entered into a spreadsheet program and compared. <br><br> Fractal dimensions calculated for absent/minimal variability segments fell within a range from 1.0101 to 1.0978. Fractal dimensions for moderate variability segments ranged from 1.1652 to 1.2887. Results indicate that there are distinct, non-overlapping ranges of fractal dimensions for areas of absent/minimal and moderate fetal heart rate variability. <br><br> Fractal dimension may be useful to researchers and clinicians as an objective measurement of fetal heart rate variability.

THE EFFECT OF MYELOPEROXIDASE ON MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND SURVIVAL IN APOE/SR-BI KNOCKOUT ANIMALS THROUGH TISSUE STUDIES
Suzanne Bobby Mazhuvanchery
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Research has shown patients who suffered from myocardial infarctions have elevated levels of an enzyme known as myeloperoxidase. Myeloperoxidase is a protein that oxidizes low density lipoprotein (LDL), lipids and other proteins, promoting plaque deposition and cardiovascular disease. Plaque in coronary arteries can erode, leading to plaque rupture and heart attack. People die from heart attacks due to complications that arise from it. One potential factor causing complications that lead to heart attack is myeloperoxidase, hence the importance of further studying this enzyme. <br><br> <br><br>I hypothesized that myeloperoxidase plays a role in myocardial infarctions. To test if this enzyme will have a positive, negative, or no overall effect, I examined mouse tissue from mice with and without myeloperoxidase and compared to the mouse’s lifespan following a heart attack. <br><br>Only recently has a new cardiovascular disease mouse model that experiences myocardial infarction been established. I used tissue from this novel Apolipoprotein E/scavenger receptor BI double knockout model to study the role of myeloperoxidase. I looked at mouse lifespan and examined sectioned mouse tissue. <br><br>Based on these tissue studies, I found that double knockout mice lived shorter lives than wild-type mice. They lived on average 10 weeks as opposed to 2 years. The triple knockout mice lived shorter than the double knockout mice. They lived on average 51 days versus 61 days (p=0.002). <br><br>The double knockout model is a unique model for studying atherosclerosis. There is cellular infiltrate, thrombi and myeloperoxidase activity. I see a survival difference in the triple knockouts, suggesting myeloperoxidase may play a protective role and have other vital functions in the body.

GREEN TEA'S ANTICANCER EFFECT ON SK-MEL-2 HUMAN MELANOMA
Chenguang Mu
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer. It can advance and spread to other parts of the body, where it becomes hard to treat and can be fatal. The green tea extract, Green Tea Polyphenols (GTP), has been identified as a preventative agent in some tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of GTP on SK-Mel-2 malignant melanoma and HEK 293 human embryonic kidney cells, especially on the cell vitality assay, release of cytokines and cellular changes. SK-Mel-2 and HEK 293 cells were stimulated by GTP. Cell Titer-Blue assay and Hoechst 33342 staining were used to check the vitality of cells and sensitivity to GTP-induced apoptosis. Western blot tested the expression of proliferation-relevant protein. Additionally, the release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha was analyzed by ELISA. This study showed that GTP could decrease the expression of proliferation-relevant protein in survived SK-Mel-2 cancer cells and obviously reduce the release of TNF-alpha. Meanwhile, GTP could result in the enhancement of apoptosis in SK-Mel-2 skin cells. In conclusions, GTP treatment can cause SK2 cancer cells to reduce the expression of proliferation-relevant proteins and lead to a nonproliferating entity reminiscent of a senescent-like cell. GTP not only inhibits proliferation-relevant proteins required for cancer cell growth, but also destroys SK-Mel-2 cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.

THE EFFECT OF DIACETYL (POPCORN LUNG CHEMICAL) ON INTESTINAL BACTERIA: A MEDICAL STUDY
Erica Jacqueline Gouse
Dominion High School, Sterling, VA

Americans consume 17 billion quarts of popcorn each year. The average American will eat 60-70 quarts of popcorn in their lifetime. The United States is responsible for nearly all of the world’s popcorn production, with 25 states growing the crop. Popcorn companies use a butter-flavored chemical called diacetyl. Exposure to this has reportedly caused the lung disease bronchiolitis obliterans (“popcorn lung") in factory workers for nearly two decades, as well as in consumers. The purpose of this research was to determine whether diacetyl negatively effected intestinal bacteria in addition to reported lung tissue. Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei were subjected to butter from four different types of microwave popcorn. Diacetyl alone was also directly added to additional bacteria plates. Bacterial growth was monitored and observed. Each plate tested with butter and diacetyl was ranked via qualitative analysis on the basis of microbial death. Escherichia coli subjected to Act II, Jolly Time, and Orville Redenbacher exhibited moderate death while Pop Secret plates showed considerable death. Plates with Escherichia coli subjected to diacetyl exhibited an extreme rate of mortality. Interestingly, there was no great mortality in Lactobacillus casei. Hence, the null hypothesis, that diacetyl would have no effect on the growth of intestinal flora, was refuted in the case of Escherichia coli and supported in the case of Lactobacillus casei. Further research of the possible harmful effects of diacetyl on the body is merited. Death of intestinal flora could possibly shut down the entire digestive system.

IGG ANTIBODY-ATTACHED TIO2 NANOTUBES FOR TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY
Kevin Shih
International Academy, Bloomfield Hills, MI

Many of the available autoimmune disease treatments temporarily inhibit inflammation in which the principle autoimmune disease pathogenesis, CIC, is not targeted by the suppressants. In order to mitigate pain and other symptoms of autoimmune disorders, TiO2 nanotubes may be utilized as agents in the removal of circulating immune complexes that accumulate in victims of autoimmune diseases. In this study, Immunoglobulin G attached TiO2 nanotubes were fabricated and then characterized through UV/VIS spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.<br><br> <br><br>The attachment of protein with specific binding to CIC, Immunoglobulin G, to the nanotube carriers required several major steps. Hydrothermal synthesis was used to fabricate the TiO2 nanotubes in a simple and cost-efficient method. The nanotubes were then functionalized with Thiolactic acid in order to create an unstable reactive O-acylisourea ester. The carboxylate-functionalized nanotubes were reacted with Suflo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinamide to form a semi-stable NHS compound which allowed 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride to convert the carboxyl groups to amine-reactive sulfo-NHS esters. The amine-reactive sulfo-NHS esters reacted with the primary amine of IgG to form amide cross-links in which IgG-TiO2 nanotube complexes were successfully synthesized. <br><br> <br><br>The antibody-nanotube complexes were evaluated under a high resolution TEM in which the presence of IgG protein was detected. The success of IgG attachment to the nanotubes was further examined under a UV/VIS spectrophotometer, with results indicating an average of 76 protein units attached to each nanotube. <br><br> <br><br>Hence, a novel concept of the use of nanostructures as adsorption tools in the clearance of waste buildup, the underlying cause of autoimmune diseases, is demonstrated.

DESIGNING ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS TYPE 2 NANOPARTICLES AS MULTIVALENT CONTRAST AGENTS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
Kshitij A. Desai
Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

Viral nanoparticles have potential applications in imaging and treatment of diseases such as angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Viral nanoparticles have distinct advantages as contrast agents for biomedical imaging, including their small size, self-assembling nature, and ease of modification. Fluorescently tagged AAV-2 nanoparticles, can be genetically engineered and used for gene and drug delivery for coupled diagnosis and therapy. AAV-2 has 540 surface exposed lysine residues per capsid. Thus, using N-hydroxysuccinimide ester chemistry, it is feasible to design fluorescently tagged AAV-2 viral nanoparticles for diagnostic imaging. <br><br>AAV-2 was produced by triple plasmid transfection of 293T cells and viral titer was determined by Quantitative PCR. The virus was purified, dialyzed, and labeled with AlexaFluor 568 fluorescent dye. Attachment of the fluorescent dye was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Degree of Labeling (DOL) was calculated per molar ratio of dye: virus capsid. A 1-hour labeling indicated that a maximum DOL of 520 was obtained. DOL results further suggested that it is feasible to obtain greater DOL by further increasing molar ratios. Quantification of fluorescence was performed using fluorescence microscopy and analyzed using Image-J software. Results showed that the AAV-2 nanoparticles were successfully fluorescently labeled. A cellular uptake study was conducted in order to visualize the binding of fluorescently labeled virus to HeLa cells at various multiplicities of infection. Fluorescence uptake by HeLa cells was successfully seen for the molar ratios tested. <br><br>Transduction experiments will be conducted to study intracellular trafficking of fluorescently labeled AAV-2 and its nuclear uptake, thus revealing the ultimate destination of the engineered virus-based contrast agents.

HUMAN MICRORNAS ARE POTENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Jenny Mi
Lakeside High School, Evans, GA

Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are chronic disorders initiated by a defect in immune tolerance to self-antigens. AIDs affect 5% of the human population, which makes AIDs a major health problem in modern medicine. Although the pathogeneses of AIDs are still unclear, genetic predisposition is a major factor for disease susceptibility. To date, specific AID susceptibility loci have been mapped to chromosome regions. However, a long search for the genes in these loci responsible for AIDs has only identified a very few protein-coding genes. microRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered non-protein coding genes that function in suppression of protein synthesis. Here, I hypothesized that miRNAs are potential candidate genes for AID susceptibility. To test this, three common AIDs were used in this study, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The PubMed and AID databases were used to identify the position of AID loci in human genome. A miRNA registry database was then used to test if any miRNAs are mapped into these AID loci. Overall, 64 (16%) of 400 miRNAs are in these AID loci (6 in psoriasis, 27 in T1D, and 31 in SLE). Furthermore, using a polymorphic database, I identified some known mutations located in miRNAs or near miRNAs, which probably affect the structure or expression of miRNAs. These data provide the first genetic evidence that miRNAs are potential susceptibility genes for AIDs. Further identification of these susceptibility genes is expected to provide insight into AID pathogenesis and define new targets for the development of therapeutic strategies.

EVALUATING TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS IN RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
Carolyn Marie Branecky
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School, Milwaukee, WI

A current method of inhibiting tumor growth entails targeting angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. This project validates the use of MRI to evaluate changes in tumor vasculature by studying how an anti-angiogenic drug affects the expression of angiogenic proteins and tumor physiology. The quantities of angiopoietins 1 and 2 in grade III glioblastomas, an aggressive brain tumor, were measured after anti-angiogenic treatment and corresponding MRI scans were taken to accomplish this end. <br><br>Fifty percent of rats inoculated with U87 brain tumors were treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). All rats underwent MRI scans that enabled the creation of cerebral blood volume and blood flow image maps. Western Blot analysis, used to determine the content of ang-1 and ang-2 in these tissues, allowed the evaluation of the relationship between protein expression and tumor vasculature. <br><br>In brain tissues containing tumor, not containing tumor, and containing a treated tumor, I found that the concentration of ang-1, which is associated with the maintenance of normal vessels, remained relatively constant. The concentration of ang-2, which plays a key role in vascular remodeling, was greater in tissues containing tumors than tissues not containing tumors and greater in untreated tumors than treated tumors. <br><br>This study helps foster an understanding of the time course of tumor angiogenesis and the response to anti-angiogenic therapy. This information will aid in the development of MRI technologies to accurately monitor these therapies and optimize the timing and dosage of treatment for cancer patients.

THE STUDY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER PEDIATRIC COLD MEDICINES ON DAPHNIA PULEX
Rebecca Lynn Gregory
Camden County High School, Elizabeth City, NC

The purpose of this experiment is to research the effects of Children’s Tylenol Plus Cold, Robitussin Pediatric Cold and Cough, Children’s Sudafed PE Cold and Cough, and NyQuil Children’s Cold and Cough as given to Daphnia pulex in quantities of 1/2d, 1d, and 2d, where d is the dosage, over a period of three days. I hypothesized that if my four tested medications are administered in my three tested dosages, then the Daphnia pulex will experience adverse cardiovascular changes. I also conjectured that Sudafed PE Cold and Cough will cause the greatest amount of change, while NyQuil Children’s Cold and Cough will cause the least amount of change. Additionally, I presumed that the greater the dosage amount, and the longer it has been in the Daphnia pulex’s biological system, the greater the effect each medication would have. The results of my experiment showed that NyQuil resulted in the least amount of adverse cardiovascular changes, while Robitussin resulted in the most significant changes. My research indicated that all of the medications at all dosages showed unfavorable cardiovascular changes to the Daphnia pulex. I also noticed the changes became more profound as the medication continued to be administered over a three day period.

GENOMIC STRATEGY TO REFINE PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF EARLY STAGE COLON CANCER
Shivani Sud
Charles E. Jordan Senior High School, Durham, NC

Clinical trials have not rendered adjuvant chemotherapy beneficial for stage II colon cancer patients. Since 40-50 percent of stage II disease patients have post-surgical recurrence, identification of patients at high-risk of recurrence would allow informed use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Using Affymetrix microarray data, gene expression profiles predicting risk of relapse were identified, creating a 50-gene predictor of recurrence, which was validated in an independent dataset. Select molecules that correlate with reversal of high-risk phenotype, Celecoxib, Retinol, Sulindac, and LY-294002, were identified through the Connectivity Map and used in in vitro drug sensitivity assays. Agents Celecoxib and LY-294002 successfully reversed the malignant phenotype of high-risk cell lines to the phenotype of benign low-risk cell lines. A model to identify which therapeutic agents will be most effective in treating tumors according to their individual phenotypes was developed to address the treatment of stage II disease. The 50-gene predictor provides a mechanism to refine the prediction of a patient’s risk of disease recurrence. This is the first study to develop a rational strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer patients. These findings could alter decisions regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage colon cancers, providing compelling evidence in support of a genomic approach that can be extended to increase the efficiency of treatment in other malignant cancers.

CLONING PLANARIA: TEMPERATURE VS. REGENERATION
Pamela Nahomi Chavero
John B. Alexander High School, Laredo, TX

Planarians have the amazing ability to regenerate and they usually reproduce by pulling apart into two different extremities. These fragments will then regenerate its missing parts. This experiment was done to present the possibilities of temperature affecting the regeneration process of planarians. Two planarian specimens were placed in two different Petri dishes at two different temperatures to determine how they are affected during the regeneration period. The two temperatures used were 21 degrees Celsius and around 5 degrees Celsius. The regeneration status was examined every day for eight days on both Petri dishes. Using a ruler (cm), both parts of the planarian were measured and recorded daily. At the culmination of the eight days of observations, the planarian at room temperature did not only regenerate completely, but was able to grow 0.27cm longer than its original measurement. The planarian at room temperature also showed changes that did not occur at all with the planarian in the refrigerator. On day 6, the inferior portion of the planarian divided into two and one of those two parts regenerated completely. On the other hand, the planarians at 5 degrees seem to be shrinking and appeared immobilized. It was found that temperature does have an effect in the process of regeneration. Room temperature proved to be the best suitable condition (temperature) for the regeneration of brown planarian.

THE EFFECT OF EXTRACELLULAR SIGNALING MOLECULES ON OLIGODENDROCYTE DIFFERENTIATION, MORPHOLOGY, PROLIFERATION, AND SURVIVAL
Jourdan Brandt Urbach
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

In the CNS, specialized neural glial cells, oligodendrocytes, encapsulate neurons in a sheath of myelin that insulates the nerve, enabling proper signal conduction. However, this sheath is destroyed during the demyelinating autoimmune attack of diseases like MS, causing degeneration of the underlying axons. Current MS treatments are blanket immunomodulators, which function by diminishing the efficacy of the immune system, thus minimizing the autoimmune attack. However, these treatments do not address the loss of motor function due to resultant demyelination. My hypothesis is that integrin signaling mediated by laminin (an influential ECM adhesion protein) signaling could promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. To study the effect of laminin and the immunomodulator therapies, I grew oligodendrocytes on a substrate of the factors being studied. During the course of the experiment, I utilized a battery of techniques to analyze the proliferation, survival, maturation, and morphology of oligodendrocytes exposed to laminin and various immunocytokines, including Interleukin 2 and Interferon-beta. I used the technique of Brdu incorporation to measure proliferation, a live-dead assay to determine the number of apoptotic cells, and a proprietary assay to determine relative morphological complexity and differentiation. I found that oligodendrocytes exposed to laminin in combination with immunomodulators differentiated at a rate 530% and proliferated at a rate 135% greater than those treated with the current leading MS treatment, Interferon-Beta.

THE EFFECTS OF DMAB-ANABASEINE ON APPL FLIES: A MODEL FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S
Adrian Kaszuba
Lynbrook Senior High School, Lynbrook, NY

This study examined the effects of DMAB-Anabaseine on APPL Flies, which is a Model for the Treatment of Alzheimer's. It was hypothesized that the DMAB-Anabaseine would increase cognitive behavior in the flies. DMAB-Anabaseine was orally administered into the flies by mixing it into the media that the larva ate before growing into adult flies. When the flies matured, a positive phototaxis assay involving the use of a light box was used. Additionally, the negative geotaxis assay was tested through the use of the tap down method. The best dosages used that restored taxis response was the 1uM and the 100uM of DMAB-Anabaseine for both the negative geotaxis and positive phototaxis assay. For example, a1uM dose of DMAB-Anabaseine improved the negative geotaxis from a time of 8.99 seconds to 1.90 seconds. This dosage had the highest response rate in seconds for the negative geotaxis and the positive phototaxis assay. Ultimately, the cognitive behavior of the APPL flies almost fully recovered to that of normal flies, supporting my hypothesis. Perhaps the benefits of this drug on flies will be similar when tested on human Alzheimer's patients.

ANALYSIS OF ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF HONEY FROM THE GENUS APIS
Bora Kang
Union Grove High School, McDonough, GA

A. Objective/Purpose: The purpose of this project is to effectively analyze the difference between the honeys of different genus Apis species regarding their antibacterial properties.<br><br>B. Hypothesis: Because the four honey bee species, Apis mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis florea and Apis cerana are so different from each other in regards to language, habitat, nesting habit, and body size, the antibacterial properties of the different honeys will also vary and its range of effectiveness will positively correlate to the amount of glucose oxidase in the honeys.<br><br>C. Procedures/Methods: After obtaining different honeys from each Apis species, the pH test solution was added to the 5mL of 25% concentration of each honey and their resulting colors of the solution were compared with the pH color card. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test was tested for the antibacterial properties of each honey. The saturated disks of different concentrations were placed into the petri dishes with Mueller Hinton agar that cultured with either bacterium E-coli K-12 or Lactobacillus acidophilus. One petri dish was served as a control. Petri dishes were incubated at 37¢ªC overnight, and the area of inhibition was recorded. Any differences of the honeys and its relationship with the pH were recorded, then analyzed.<br><br>D. Results: Honeys from each species were different and their antibacterial properties were closely related with the honey¡¯s pH.<br><br>E. Conclusion/Discussion: The amount of gluocose oxidase added to the honey by bees, which was determined by the pH of the honeys, exhibited a close association with honey¡¯s antibacterial properties.

INVESTIGATING THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATION OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS IN VASCULAR CALCIFICATION THROUGH EXPOSURE TO CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS
Lia D'Abate
The Sacred Heart School of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, CANADA

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in vascular tissues and suspected to be implicated in the calcification of atherosclerotic tissue; however esearch on the effects of risks for cardiovascular disease on the mineralization of MSCs is in its incipiency. This project serves to explore the effects of stimuli that cardiovascular risk factors on the calcification of MSCs: oxidative stress (H202/0.1 mM), type II diabetic conditions (dextrose/25 mM), inflammatory response (C-reactive protein (CRP)/7.5 mg/L) and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxy-LDL/50 micrograms/L). <br><br>MSCs derived from human bone marrow (hMSCs) were incubated for 2 weeks with the determined concentration of each stimulus. Morphological changes in the hMSCs were monitored periodically. It was observed that H202 and CRP induced cell apoptosis (approximately 20% and 75%, respectively). The correct pathological level of LDL oxidation could not be achieved and prevented its foreseen use in the experiment. Cells stimulated with dextrose thrived and remained at full confluence throughout the course of incubation.<br><br>After incubation with the stimuli, the cells were tested for the presence of prominent osteogenic markers. The levels of secreted osteopontin, determined by ELISA, were unable to be properly determined as indicated by the discrepancy in amount of the marker found in hMSC controls and positive controls. The amount of alkaline phosphatase activity produced by hMSCs stimulated with dextrose was quantified by a fluorescent substrate and significantly exceeded that produced by hMSC control cells and hMSC incubated with the other stimuli. In contrast, the detection of calcium in hMSC exposed to H202, CRP and dextrose were increased at least two-fold, the maximum increase being achieved by CRP.<br><br>The results obtained thus far are indicatory of the potential implication of MSCs in vascular calcification under the influence of specific cardiovascular risk factors in vitro, something previously unrecorded in the literature. Significant long term ramifications of this research include determining how to find a way to reverse or inhibit the calcification process , thus channelling the differentiation capacities of MSCs constructively to their function in tissue repair.

EFFECT OF CONTROLLED LIBERATION OF THE ETHANOLIC EXTRACT FROM MOMORDICA CHARANTIA LEAVES ON GASTRO AND HEPATOPROTECTION THROUGH A POLYMERIC MATRIX OF CARBOPOL
Leonardo Duarte Sobreira Luna
Colegio Christus, Fortaleza, Ceara, BRASIL

The medicinal plants present a pharmacological potential by their different properties. The Momordica charantia is a very common plant in the coast and Brazilian countryside. This plant presents several medicinal properties, among them the gastro and hepatoprotection, which were proven through studies of the ethanolic extract (EE) of the leaves. However not only the leaves present therapeutic purpose, but also the flower, the seeds and the stalk; in addition, this plant is one of the most studied in the world. Due to the importance of the development of new phytoterapics related to the gastric and hepatic properties, this study aims to obtain the effect of the controlled liberation of EE of the leaves of M. charantia on gastro and hepatoprotection through a degradable polymeric matrix that had in its base carbopol (CBP). The gastric tissue (pre-treated with the hidrogel – CBP + EE 100 mg/Kg) and the blood (previously collected) were distributed into 8 groups (n=7). The test groups were studied into 1h, 4h or 24h (CBP + EE or EE), there were also control groups – positive and negative control, in order to compare the efficiency of the product in this study tested. Before opening the stomachs along the grater curvature and fixing it between two glass plates for macroscopic evaluation, the volume of them was measured. The length (mm) of each lesion was measured by a caliper. The pH (tornassol paper, Merck®), stomachal volume (mL) and transaminases (GPT and GOT) were evaluated. Results (mean ± S.E.) of lesions scores (mm), pH, volume (mL), GPT and GOT (U/L) were, respectively: negative control – 0 ± 0; 4.52± 0.25; 538.33 ± 28.80; 79.4; 247.2; positive control – 15.97 ± 0.48; 4.44 ± 0.25; 721.42 ± 34.25; 96.1; 170.5; EE 1h – 7.19 ±1.07; -; -; 48.3; 100.5; EE 4h – 15.82 ± 5.57; 15.82 ± 5.57; 1948.39 ± 632.96; 72.4; 144.4; EE 24h – 33.28 ± 9.81; 33.28 ± 9.81; 884.28 ± 340.68; -; -; CBP + EE 1h – 23.33 ± 3.84; - ; -.; 48.3; 100.5; CBP + EE 4h – 1.73 ± 0.22; 2.16 ± 0.14; 741.66 ± 38.44; 72.4; 144.4; CBP + EE 24h – 0.13 ± 0; 1.85 ± 0.14; 771.42 ± 39.12; -; -. These results suggest that controlled liberation of EE of M. charantia leaves have gastro and hepatoprotective activity.

THE USE OF B. ORELLANA L. EXTRACT (URUCUN) IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUNBLOCKS AGAINST MELANOMAS AND SKIN CARCINOMAS
Bruno Fernando de Oliveira Buzo
Colegio Koelle, Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

The cases of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Melanoma grow more and more in the modern world, due to the raise of UVA and UVB radiation, affecting more the lower classes – that have less information about the importance of skin protection, and no money to compose the use of sunlotions with their basic necessities. <br><br>Skin cancer in Brazilian Indian populations, that live in areas close to the equator, more exposed to Carcinoma and Melanoma diseases, show lower incidence than in other areas as reported in statistics research. Besides from the Indian phenotype, these populations could have other factors that may contribute to their skin protection.<br><br>This research hypothesis is that the Brazilian Indians have low incidence of skin cancer due to the use of body paint made of Urucun (Bixa orellana L.), a common fruit in our national territory. <br><br>The active ingredient from the Brazilian fruit – Urucun – was researched and analyzed and, based on experimental data; its protection potential when added to conventional sun lotions was tested. Results show that a sun lotion incremented with Urucun allows better skin conservation and more UVA and UVB protection if compared to conventional sun lotions based on quimioprotectors and Zinc and Titanium oxides. <br><br>The Urucum behavior and its benefits compared to conventional sun lotions were analyzed: low price, adequate cosmetic color, and FPS similar to the sun lotions sold in the market.<br><br>Improving the composition of traditional sun lotions, seeking for new chemical sun filters (biodegradable, accessible to the population, and easy handling), an alternative prophylactic method against the skin pathogenesis was developed.

EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR YOUR HEART
Chun-Yin Lee
S.K.H. Bishop Mok Sau Tseng Secondary School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Nowadays, the unhealthy life practice prompts the increase in heart diseases rate. However, few heart monitoring devices are developed for public use. As a result, I developed my model “Listen to Your Heart”.<br><br>My model is a modified stethoscope and consists of 3 parts: the sensor, the amplifier and the output. It can be connected to a computer, and presents the heart sounds in forms of graphs, by which a lay person can monitor his own heart condition at home, and seeks immediate medical assistance before any critical situation arises.<br><br>My model only costs about US$15, while the electrocardiographs used by hospitals and medical centers cost much more and require lots of professional medical knowledge.<br><br>My model acts as a pre-warning system and NEVER displaces the diagnosis work of doctor. On the contrary, my product is designed to let people carry out some daily-checks and to urge more high-riskers, like the elderly, to go to the doctors for more detailed diagnosis in case they found that they have heart problems by providing more preliminary objective analysis for public use.<br><br>Indeed, this device has shown a high reliability throughout various experiments and real time tests. During the real time analysis, the accuracy of differentiating patients suffering from heart diseases was 80.4%, in which 52 visitors were suffering from heart diseases concerning heart structure failure while 42 were identified by my invention. If the real time analysis was conducted in domestic household conditions, where the noise intensity could be minimized, it is believed that the accuracy would be much enhanced.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE MOLECULAR TARGETS AFFECTING THE ACTION OF AMPHETAMINE IN THE DOPAMINERGIC PATHWAY
Charlie L Xie
Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet, Nashville, TN

Drug abuse and addiction pose a serious hazard to public health; understanding the physiological targets of drugs is essential in the prevention and treatment of these problems. Many addictive drugs, including the family of amphetamines, work primarily through the dopaminergic pathway. To assess the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) in the dopaminergic pathway on individual behavior, C. elegans was selected as a model organism. Swimming-induced paralysis (SWIP) rates were used as a behavior indicator to quantify the potency of AMPH in C. elegans. First, we obtained several mutants, each lacking a key enzyme, receptor, or transporter in the dopaminergic pathway. Then, we determined SWIP rates for the wild type and these mutants after they were exposed to different concentrations of AMPH for a certain period of time. Finally, the SWIP rates of each mutant were compared to those of the wild type to determine the role of each component. Our results demonstrate the dopamine transporter is crucial to AMPH action, while the effective synthesis and packaging of dopamine is also required. In addition, the data show that AMPH activity relies primarily on inhibitory receptors of the D2 family, especially the DOP-3 receptor. Removal of the DOP-3 receptor in C. elegans did not increase SWIP rates compared to the control, suggesting it may be an ideal therapeutic target. These observations will be beneficial in developing new treatments for neurological disorders and substance abuse. Future studies will characterize potential remedies for tolerance related disorders by analyzing sensitization or desensitization induced in C. elegans.

MODALITIES OF IRREVERSIBLE ELECTROPORATION AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS IN PROSTATE CANCER
Adam Vincent Delora
Saint Pius X High School, Albuquerque, NM

This study introduces a means of increased efficacy of Irreversible Electroporation (IRE). The procedure suggested is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of prostate cancer. Electroporation is the permeabilization of a cell membrane as a result of an applied electric field. Irreversible electroporation causes nanoscale pores that result in the loss of homeostasis of tissues. Reversible electroporation has been employed for the introduction of cytotoxic drugs, but until recently IRE has not been employed. Cyro-ablation has become an accepted treatment for prostate cancer, but as previously stated the limitations include variable damage at the cryo lesions margin, injury to adjacent structures such as rectum, urethra and NVB (neurovascular bundle), and long procedure time due to the need for multiple freeze thaw cycles, that have limited the acceptance of this modality. (3) As a function of the field amplitude and duration, the electorporation can be reversible, or irreversible. The purpose of this experiment is to increase the efficacy of IRE with the use of variable modalities of treatment in prostate cancer. With this surgeons may begin to add IRE to their cache of weapons in the treatment of cancer. The Irreversible electroporation did cause the cells to lose homeostasis which resulted in cell death. The modification of the modality by the addition of Lovastatin was also successful and caused a decrease in cell viability in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 (metastatic bone) and LAPC4(metastatic lymph node). I was able to determine that Lovastatin decreased the cell membrane integrity significantly. So far the study has concluded that Irreversible Electroporation can be used in combination with certain compounds to receive a more pronounced or synergistic effect in treatment. So it can be concluded, due to increased effect electroporation by means of the lack of membrane cholesterol biosynthesis, there is a decrease in the integrity of the cell. Lovastatin acts as an electro-sensitizer to cause a synergistic effect. This can be used as a combination therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

EFFECTS OF EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE ON INHIBITION OF METASTATIC BEHAVIOR OF PROSTATE CANCER CELL LINE PC-3
Hang Richard Zou
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

The majority of prostate cancer patient death results not from primary tumors but rather from metastatic behavior. This is the process by which cancer cells migrate from a primary tumor to one or more secondary sites. Metastatic potential has been shown to be highly correlated with the expression of several genes, including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8). The purpose of this study was to determine how Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea, affects advanced prostate cancer cell metastasis. In this study, the androgen-independent PC-3 cell prostate cancer line was treated with different concentrations of EGCG (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150 µg/mL) in vitro. MMP-9 and IL-8 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expressions were determined by Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction, Immunocytochemistry, and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay. PC-3 prostate cancer cell migration across a FluoroBlock membrane was determined by Cell Migration Assay. Prostate cancer anchorage-independent growth, a measure of cell proliferation, was observed through Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay. Treatment of PC-3 cells with EGCG resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 and IL-8 mRNA and protein expressions. Results indicated an EGCG concentration of 50 µg/mL inhibited ~ 70% of IL-8 expression at both mRNA and protein levels as well as ~ 50% of MMP-9 expression at the protein level. Treatment of EGCG at 100 µg/mL and 150 µg/mL also resulted in significant alterations of colony formation size. Immunocytochemistry illustrated the rapid inhibition of MMP-9 expression with increasing treatments of EGCG, as well as prostate cancer nuclei condensation, an indication of apoptosis. EGCG has the budding promise of delaying and potentially inhibiting metastatic behavior of prostate cancer through its dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 and IL-8, key factors in the regulation of metastasis. Because markers of prostate cancer metastatic behavior include MMP-9 and IL-8 expressions, anchorage-independent growth, and cellular migration, this study confirmed that EGCG, the major constituent of green tea, may be further developed into a therapeutic compound for the treatment and cure of prostate cancer.

DEEP KNEE BENDS: HAZARDOUS TO RUNNERS?
John Ryan Hooton
Herculaneum Highschool, Herculaneum, MO

My experiment was about what knee angle causes the most strain on the quadriceps tendon. During my research I learned that tendons connect the muscles to bone and withstands the tension. They also transfer the contractions of the quadriceps muscle and exert an elastic force if stretched. This is similar to Hook's Law which also applies to the spring making it a good representation of the quadriceps muscle.<br><br> I did this experiment because I am a cross country runner and wanted to find out a way to reduce strain on my legs. My hypothesis was that if the knee angle is at 75, 60, 45 or 30 degrees, then the angle that will cause the most strain on the quadriceps tendon would be 75 degrees. To test this hypothesis I built a model leg and used a spring to represent the quadriceps muscle which measured the tension/strain. To measure this strain, I placed the knee at the angle I wanted by using a protractor and then tightened the wire, (which represented the quadriceps tendon) using the guitar tuner. I adjusted the tension until I reached equilibrium. I then measured the spring with a ruler and recorded the data. I subtracted the measurement of the spring at rest (measured before I started testing) which gave me the data to tell me what knee angle created the most strain on the tendon. My conclusion supported my hypothesis. Therefore if I run with a longer stride, I would have less strain.

THE EFFECT OF STREPTOZOTOCIN ON CHICK EMBRYOS
Keshav Kukreja
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

The chick embryo is a unique model system in that it has an easily accessible external respiratory organ, the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). In its present form, the project is the result of experimentation on the effects of streptozotocin on the glucose and insulin levels of a chick embryo. Our results show that the chick embryo has the potential to complement studies on diabetes in rodents and other mammals.<br><br>Diabetes and the resulting hyperglycemia were induced by the injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Glucose levels and insulin levels were measured using an Ascensia Elite blood glucose testing kit and the Rat Insulin Elisa kit from Crystal Chem. Inc., respectively. Streptozotocin was diluted with phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS), and was injected in 50mL PBS for a total of 300 micrograms/egg. PBS alone, the diluent, was used as the control. <br><br>Following injection, the glucose levels of chicks treated with STZ were significantly higher than those of the chicks treated with the diluent buffer. Insulin levels of STZ-treated chicks were lower than in the control chicks that had normal insulin levels, which suggested diabetes had been induced. Next, we wanted to determine whether the experimental diabetes that we induced could be reversed by treatment with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). HMSC are known to differentiate into a variety of cells, to induce blood vessel formation and to decrease tissue damage due to immune response. Compared with STZ alone, the chicks treated with hMSC and STZ had significantly lower glucose levels than chicks with only STZ. Further research is required to understand the mechanism by which hMSC protect against STZ-induced pancreatic damage. Our results demonstrate that chick embryos may provide an inexpensive and pain-free alternative to using existing mammalian diabetic models for adult cell therapy research.

OBESITY, THE XXI CENTURY'S DISEASE
Vanessa Cristina Dias
Escola Secundaria de Sao Joao da Talha, Lisboa, PORTUGAL

Weight excess and obesity are known problems to many people. Our world is becoming fatter and fatter. How can we solve this? Which treatment can be used? What’s the right one? The natural method is what this project wants to emphasize. No pills, no drugs or hunger. Food habits reeducation and sport practice are the main keys to reduce weight. Loosing weight isn’t easy but it’s possible if we start to understand that we are what we eat and our health is one of the most important things, so we must be aware about the way we should eat and the big value of sport practicing. Obeses and overweight people have to take conscience of their real issue and disease. If they don’t, they will get worse and break all existing limits and also get serious health problems, which are reported along this project too. To be overweight is not only an esthetic problem - it’s a health issue which affects body and mind. This experience shows how I lost about 110 pounds in two and a half years with a natural and healthy method which involves better nourishment habits and physical exercises practice.

A HISTOLOGICAL STUDY OF C-FOS ACTIVITY IN THE SECOND GENERATION RAT TISSUE DESCENDANT FROM THE FIRST GENERATION EXPOSED TO HIGH, LOW, AND NORMAL SALT DIETS
Han Li
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY

Excessive salt intake can cause health problems including high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases, and can be addictive. Salt has influenced the brain in the same ways as methamphetamine on first generation rats. The objective of this study was to evaluate the salt effect on second generation rats when first generation female rats were fed different salt diets. All animal work was performed by University researchers. Three salt diets were used including low (0.12% NaCl), normal (1% NaCl), and high (4% NaCl). Constants were daylight and the amount of water given to each rat. Second generation rats bred from first generation were fed a normal salt diet until maturity. Second generation brain tissues were maintained in a preserved solution [30% sucrose/70% phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution]. Using immuno-blot technique, brain tissue specimens were cut, washed with hydrogen peroxide, blocked with goat serum, probed with primary and secondary antibodies, stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB), and mounted. Each group was imaged, observed and counted for stained C-fos. Protein data was collected and compared from tissue specimens using a microscope. Results display significant differences in rat brain activity between different salt diet treatments, exemplified in changes of C-fos in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the brain tissue (P<0.05), resulting in a significant effect on second generation rats from prenatal and postnatal conditions. This study implicates the importance of lifestyle factors of current society critical; determinants have a significant influence on decedents.

SEVERITY OF NEURONAL INJURY ALTERS THE KINETICS AND MAGNITUDE OF THE T-CELL RESPONSE
Shivani Bharat Parikh
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, FL

The central nervous system (CNS) is under immune surveillance by circulating T cells. Neural disease or injury results in significant trafficking of T cells into the CNS. Moreover, recent studies suggest that T cells prevent neurodegeneration following injury, although the mechanisms behind this process are unclear. Specifically, site-specific infiltration of T cells to injured motor neurons of the facial motor nucleus (FMN), which is within the CNS, has been observed; however, it is largely unknown how the severity of nerve injury affects the T cell response in the facial nerve axotomy model. <br><br> This study compared the T cell response and levels of neuronal death at several time points following nerve crush or resection – two variations of the facial nerve axotomy model that result in mild or severe neuronal loss, respectively. It was predicted that resection injuries would yield a greater and longer T cell response than a crush injury.<br><br> Comparisons were made at several post-injury time points for the number of CD3+ T cells and CD11b+ microglial phagocytic clusters, which represent dead or dying neurons, within the FMN. A correlation between magnitude of T cell response and recovery of whisker response was observed, further suggesting a neuroregenerative effect of T cells. <br><br> T cell response in resection injuries had greater magnitude and duration than in crush injuries; the response peaked at 21 days in resection injuries and 14 days in crush injuries. Sensitization of the FMN to resection injury further increased levels of immune response and behavioral recovery. <br><br> These results suggest that a T cell response – and subsequent neuroregeneration – can be optimized by resection and sensitization to a neural injury. This has profound therapeutic implications for repairing nerve injury.

THE ROLE OF AKT/PKB IN THE REGULATION OF CHOLINERGIC GENE EXPRESSION BY NGF
Sonia Vikram Shah
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, FL

Nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts anti-apoptotic and differentiating actions on sympathetic neurons and cholinergic cells and activates the expression of genes regulating the synthesis and storage of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This cholinergic effect of NGF is especially important in Alzheimer’s disease, in which there is a substantial loss of cholinergic neurons and up to 90% reduction in acetylcholine. The NGF effect on cholinergic gene expression is studied by identifying the intracellular signaling pathway involved in this process. The Akt/PKB pathway was tested for involvement in NGF-induced cholinergic expression in the rat neuronal cell line PC12. The Akt/PKB pathway was blocked using two Akt inhibitors (HIMO and TAT-Akt-in) and Akt-specific siRNA. Cholinergic gene expression was determined in RT/PCR assays and in transfections of PC12 cells with cholinergic locus promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. NGF strongly up-regulated promoter activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) up to 8-fold, while treatment with Akt inhibitors significantly reduced the NGF effect to nearly control levels. These results indicate for the first time that the Akt/PKB pathway is required for the NGF-mediated expression of cholinergic genes in PC12 cells, and thus plays a crucial role in developing treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.

MUSCLE ADAPTATION IN RESPONSE TO VOLUNTARY EXERCISE: PART II, BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETIC ALTERATIONS
Claci Camille Ayers
Warren Central High School, Bowling Green, KY

This is is part II of a continuing project. The ultimate purpose of this experiment is to see the muscle adaptation in response to voluntary exercise in phosphorylase kinase deficient mice. The parts of the experiment completed last year were obtaining and analyzing the exercise data for the C57/Bl6 mice (control mice) and heart weight to body weight ratios. This year the exercise analysis for the deficient mice was started for 1wk and 2wk juvenile and heart weight to body weight ratios, lactate levels, and gene expression changes were also determined. The exercise data was taken for adult (10-12 weeks old) and juvenile (4-6 weeks old) mice for the time periods of 1, 2, and 5 weeks of voluntary exercise. The lactate assays were performed by a Lactate Plus Meter and were measured on a scale of mmol lactate. The gene expression was found by using polymerase chain reaction to see changes in gene expression of the genes lipase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, muscle phosphofructokinase, glucose transporter (GLUT4) and fatty acid translocase CD36. First, forward and reverse primers for each gene were found using computer analyses, then the genes were amplified and finally the products were visualized on an agarose gel by gel electrophoresis. This amplification process will help determine the quantitative changes in gene expression that result from voluntary exercise. This experiment could eventually help humans with phosphorylase kinase deficiency.

THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC ON BLOOD PRESSURE
Emily Margret Embry
Calvary Christian School, Covington, KY

The initial purpose of this experiment was to show the effects of different styles of music on a person’s blood pressure. After researching the topic thoroughly, the following hypothesis was produced. If different styles of music are tested, the heavy metal music will raise blood pressure the most. <br><br> For this experiment, a resting blood pressure was taken to establish a control for each person. Participating volunteers went three at a time into an isolated room and listened to three songs: pop, heavy metal, and classical. After each song, a registered nurse took their blood pressures one at a time. Only systolic, the pressure when the heart is contracting, were recorded because that is where the change was most apparent.<br><br> The results showed that, though each of the types of music affected the blood pressures, the heavy metal type raised it the most as was predicted in the hypothesis. The normal reactions to the music were that the volunteer’s blood pressure increased slightly during the pop music, increased considerably during the heavy metal, and dropped just as drastically during the classical. Concept learned through this experiment included how music affects brain waves, heartbeat, breathing, and blood pressure to calm people down or get them excited or even agitated. The contributions of this project techniques that could provide medical benefits and give incentives for safety measures in stressful situations.

THE MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF THE P53 GENE IN THE BUCCAL MUCOSA OF SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Sanjeethan Christopher Baksh
Lancaster Catholic High School, Lancaster, PA

Lung cancer is a significant health burden, with detection being expensive and invasive. Cigarette smoke, the commonest cause, induces changes throughout the respiratory tract (field effect). Thus abnormalities in the oral mucosa may be an indicator of similar changes in the lung, and their study may lead to a non-invasive and inexpensive method of identifying persons at high risk of developing lung cancer. P53 is the most commonly mutated gene in all cancers. It was hypothesized that the buccal mucosa of smokers would show mutations in the p53 gene, while nonsmokers would not. <br><br>Buccal smears of 8 smokers and 6 nonsmokers were obtained (male : female; 1:1). The DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using primers designed to flank exon 8 of the p53 gene. The products were run on agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm that an appropriate product was obtained. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was performed utilizing the enzymes MspI and HpyCh4V. The RFLP results were visualized by electrophoresis. <br><br>Four of the eight smokers (three females and one male) showed a digestion pattern consistent with an underlying mutation at the site of the MspI enzyme, and one of these at the HpyCh4V enzyme restriction site. No abnormalities were found in the nonsmokers. The results demonstrate that smokers showed more mutations of the buccal mucosa than nonsmokers and thus may be at an increased risk of abnormalities in the lung. The female predominance supports a possible hormonal role in the development of mutations in smokers.

INDUCED CELL DEATH IN DOXORUBICIN(DOX)-TREATED H9C2 CELLS BY SILENCING HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 27(HSP27)
Vikram Santhanam
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH

The human body is sometimes dangerously overprotective. In the case of cancer, the body’s heat shock response protects against the programmed cell death initiated by chemotherapeutic drugs. Doxorubicin (DOX) kills cancerous cells in two ways: through DNA-mutation and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the release of ROS, the p53 pathway is upregulated to ultimately create apoptosis of the damaged cells. However, ROS also upregulates p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which initiates Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). Hsp27 binds to p53 and transactivates it. As a result, p21 is expressed and causes there to be a cell cycle arrest—increasing cell survival. Through the effort of killing cancerous cells, the drug has actually worked in reverse and has caused the body to protect itself from “harm.” In doing so, it has reduced the effect of DOX. To investigate whether Hsp27 really is a cause for cancer cells to be drug resistant, Hsp27 was silenced using siRNA (small interfering RNA) in DOX-treated H9c2 cells. If the protein is a factor, then in the future, it could be suppressed before DOX-treatment.<br><br> <br><br>First, the H9c2 cells were cultured and DOX was added to two flasks of cells. One flask was silenced with Hsp27. Western blots confirmed that Hsp27 was silenced by siRNA and Methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay showed that siRNA-treated H9c2 cells were less viable than normal H9c2 cells treated with DOX. Hsp27 was, in fact, a factor in drug resistance and DOX can kill cells more effectively when Hsp27 is not present.

ALTERNATIVE SPLICING DEFECTS LINKED TO AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS
Alicia Marie Darnell
Pelham Memorial High School, Pelham, NY

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, with the exception of 2% of cases that are caused by a dominantly inherited mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1). There has been speculation that alternative splicing defects could play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS, but definitive data has never been obtained in genetically affected individuals. To develop an assay for this possibility, gene transcripts important in lower motor neuron function were examined in SOD1 mutant mice. Alternative splicing defects were identified in four out of four SOD1 mice but in zero of four control animals. Quantitation of PCR products confirmed that on average, 1.5-2 fold changes in splicing of Chl1, Agrin, and LAR spinal cord mRNA transcripts were present. Since these genes code for proteins that play a role in motor neuron synapse formation and function, the missplicing of these mRNAs in SOD1 mutant mice suggests that alternative splicing defects leading to the production of abnormal motor neuron synapses may play a role in ALS. The identification of these splicing defects may lead to a much needed diagnostic tool and provides new leads towards treatment and better understanding of ALS pathogenesis.

GENE THERAPY IN HEMOPHILIA
Caitlin Elizabeth Curnyn
Yorktown High School, Yorktown, NY

Hemophilia is a congenital genetic disease that affects the body's ability to clot correctly and inhibits clotting factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII is an enzyme synthesized by the liver and hemophiliacs either have a mutated gene or lack the gene that enables the liver to produce it. Gene therapy involves the altering of a defective piece of DNA by replacing it with the "correct" DNA and the expected result is that the defective DNA will be overwritten. Gene therapy requires the use of a vector such as a plasmid, an extrachromasomal circular DNA molecule found in bacteria, to deliver the piece of DNA that will replace the other. Once altered, plasmids can autonomously replicate in a colony of bacteria. In order to make an efficient plasmid model for hemophilia to deliver the gene that allows the production of FVIII it was hypothesized that CB-AAT and Apo-A1, two types of plasmids, could be combined together. CB-AAT contains the backbone for Adeno-associated virus which can infect cells and incorporate its genome into the host. Apo-A1 is a protein component of High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). Using the restriction enzymes EcorR1 and Not1 two plasmids, CB-AAT and Apo-A1, were cut into two sections via enzyme digestion. Gel electrophoresis was able to verify that the two plasmids had combined to form one plasmid. This plasmid can then replicate within bacteria colonies and can be inserted with FVIII DNA and eventually delivered to a mouse model test subject.

THE ROLE OF EGFR IN TGF-BETA INDUCED PAI-1 GENE EXPRESSION
Anjali Puttachi
Shaker High School, Latham, NY

Atherosclerosis is a complex disease process characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich plaques within arterial walls. One of the key stages of early plaque development is smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration, which activates inflammation. The degradation of the protein plasmin has shown to stimulate SMC proliferation and migration. Plasmin is found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of arterial walls, and is generated by the protein plasminogen. Plasminogen activated inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a major physiological regulator of plasminogen synthesis, and consequently, elevated PAI-1 synthesis has been shown to decrease plasmin and plasminogen levels, causing increased SMC migration, proliferation, and ECM accumulation. <br><br> It has been shown that in SMC, PAI-1 is activated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Samarakoon et al. demonstrated that induced PAI-1 expression in SMC required the ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathway. This signal transduction pathway requires catalyzation by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Because TGF-β is also involved in ERK activation, it is hypothesized that EGFR is involved in TGF-β induced PAI-1 gene expression. This study lends evidence to the existence of a TGF-β –regulated PAI-1 pathway as well as evaluates the relevance of the possible EGFR-ERK pathway to PAI-1 activation through Smad2 and MEK. The results from this experiment established the necessity of EGFR in PAI-1 expression, thereby leading us to a better understanding of how PAI-1 is expressed in SMC. This greater understanding of PAI-1 expression and its dependence EGFR is a critical contribution to this field that could aid in earlier diagnosis of atherosclerosis and providing more efficient treatment.

MICROFLUIDIC IMAGE CYTOMETRY TO DETECT PI3K PATHWAY MARKERS IN BRAIN CANCER
Jane Yoonhae Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

A new generation of anticancer drugs targets molecular pathways, yet cancer treatment still remains inefficient and is in need of further development. Macro-scaled imaging modalities rely on reductions of tumor size to determine the effectiveness of drug treatment but this takes weeks to see noticeable change. Even though patients have similar tumors, they respond differently to treatment because of their unique molecular signature. In order to quickly assess the efficacy of drug treatment and analyze the different molecular profiles, the Microfluidic Image Cytometry was utilized.<br><br> The Microfluidic Image Cytometry platform allows for single cell level detection and analysis to compare protein expressions in a cell population’s response to drug treatment. Immunocytochemistry methods of antibody staining were used. U87 cells, brain cancer cells, were fixated and expression levels were detected inside a PDMS microfluidic device. Fluorescent dyes were attached to antibodies to target the PI3K pathway markers in brain cancer: EGFR, EGFRvIII, PTEN, and pS6. <br><br> Optimum conditions were determined by measuring fluorescent intensity levels using MetaMorph. Optimum antibody concentrations for detection of EGFRvIII, PTEN, and pS6 were established: 0.5 ug/mL, 2.5 ug/mL, and 4.5 ug/mL respectively. The U87 cells were treated with rapamycin drug treatment and pS6 levels served to measure the effective concentrations, 2nM to 20nM, needed in order to inhibit the PI3K pathway.<br><br> The Microfluidic Image Cytometry is an effective and quick method for real-time analysis of cancer treatment response because of its small sample volume, large-scale analysis, and single cell precision.

THE KILLING GAME: COPPER--A POSSIBLE BACTERICIDE FOR CONTACT SURFACES
Michael Thomas Stockwell
Tuscumbia High School, Tuscumbia, MO

Antibiotic resistant bacteria are becoming more prevalent across the country not only in hospitals, but also in community settings like schools. These infections are often spread by common contact surfaces such as door handles and push plates. Copper has been suggested to have antimicrobial properties and has been suggested as a replacement surface for stainless steel. <br><br>In this study stainless steel, brass, and copper plates were tested for bacteria after a 24-hour exposure on the doors of school restrooms. Bacterial samples were collected from a 100 cm2 area on each plate for comparison. In addition, a known quantity of E. coli and S. epidermidis were placed on each the different types of metal plates to determine the plates’ antimicrobial properties over time. <br><br> Based on this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:<br><br>1) Both the copper and brass demonstrated antimicrobial properties in the field study on public school restrooms. The results were significant (p<.05)<br><br>2) Brass was comparable to copper in its antimicrobial effectiveness<br><br>3) Over 99% of the E. coli and S. epidermidis were killed on the copper and brass plates within 30 minutes in the laboratory controlled experiment.

CAN GENE THERAPY VECTORS CAUSE CANCER?
Ruvini Amanda Omattage
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Mice subjected to gene therapy for correcting phenylketonuria with a gene vector containing an enhancer element (WPRE) found to have developed tumors in the liver in contrast to those treated with a gene vector without WPRE. In order to test the hypothesis that the enhanced gene expression under the control of WPRE element lead to abnormal expression of genes responsible for tumor development, gene expression patterns in liver tissues from control mice, mice treated with or without WPRE containing gene vector were compared using a mouse whole genome microarray. Complementary DNA (cDNA) from different tissues was labeled with different color fluorescent dyes. Equal amounts of cDNA from control and treatment tissues were mixed and hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays representing entire mouse genome. Expression levels of genes between control and treatments as well as between treatments were compared using statistical methods available in microarray analysis software. Statistically significant gene expression differences were observed between liver tissues injected with gene therapy vectors with and without WPRE elements. Several known oncogenes had elevated expression levels in the liver tissues injected with the vector with WPRE element, indicating a role of WPRE in indiscriminate gene expression enhancement.

EFFECT OF NICOTINE ON RB & E2F1 CELL CYCLE REGULATORS IN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Courtney Alexandra Smith
C. Leon King High School, Tampa, FL

It has been speculated that nicotine has an effect on the proliferation of breast cancer. However, the molecular pathway by which nicotine affects breast cancer has not yet been established. The construction of this molecular pathway will increase our understanding of the effect of smoking on the development of breast cancer. Although it has already been established that nicotine is not carcinogenic alone, I observed that it has a notable effect on cell cycle regulation in breast cancer cells. In my research, I examined the effect of nicotine on RB and E2F1 protein cell cycle regulators in breast cancer cells using immunofluorescent analysis of cells treated with differing concentrations of nicotine (.5ul, 1ul, and 1.5ul) for different durations of time (2h, 4h, and 8h). Next, I analyzed the localization of the proteins as related to the nicotine treatment concentration and duration and determined the relative amount of RB and E2F1 in nuclei and cytoplasm of the cancer cells. As a result of my research, I have found that nicotine dissociates E2F1 and RB from the nucleus and causes the proteins to become more diffuse within the cytoplasm as both the nicotine concentration and duration of the treatment increases. Nicotine causes 4% of RB and 3% of E2F1 to become localized in the cytoplasm, promoting the phosphorylation of RB by mediating its exportation outside of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that nicotine encourages the proliferation of breast cancer cells by disassociating RB and E2F1 from each other and thus preventing the proteins from effectively binding and inducing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The study also suggests the presence of non-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the breast that allow nicotine’s repression of apoptosis. Therefore, it is viable to state that nicotine assists breast cancer in avoiding apoptosis. By further investigation of this study, it will be possible to construct a pathway modeling the mechanism by which nicotine affects RB and E2F1.

A NOVEL ANTI-MICROBIAL BONE GRAFT COMPRISING MICROENCAPSULATED ANTIBIOTIC WITHIN A DEGRADABLE POLYMER COATING
David Christopher Evans
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Bone infections constitute a challenging clinical problem, commonly affecting patients with diabetes, orthopedic trauma, and invasive dental surgery. To address the need to both treat and prevent infection in these applications, I have designed and tested a new bone graft scheme that incorporates the controlled release of antibiotic over the six week time course required to clear typical bone infections. My bone construct incorporates microencapsulated gentamicin within a slowly degrading biocompatible polymer matrix (polycaprolactone or PCL) spray coated over small cubes of human allograft bone, or “croutons”. Gentamicin infused Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM), a bone protein slurry, is added to provide bolus antibiotic release. Gentamicin release kinetics were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after release in simulated body fluid after soaking over a 24 hour to 6 week time interval. Retention of bacteriocidal activity after formulation was verified against Escherichia coli through Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) studies whereby bacterial kill zones were measured. Release data at six weeks confirmed concentrations of 3 µg/ml for my PCL/DBM release scheme, a sufficient quantity to treat relevant bacterial infection. Specimens with no controlled release strategy eluted no drug at this time point. ZOI studies after 6 weeks again demonstrated the superiority of my PCL/DBM approach, exhibiting strong microbial inhibition (5 mm) while the control provided none. My antibiotic releasing bone graft has application not only in the treatment of chronic bone infections, but also in prophylactic, bone filling scenarios to prevent the formation of destructive biofilms.

VISUAL ADAPTATION TO LOW LIGHT LEVELS: A STUDY OF THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RATE OF ADAPTATION
Katie Joan Nix
Grove High School, Grove, OK

Of the 6,420,000 car accidents that occur in the United States each year, 42% of fatal accidents occur at night. This number could be so high because of drunk drivers, fatigued drivers and visual adaptation. People’s ability to adapt to low light situations could be affected by numerous factors.<br><br>The factors considered in this study include: aging, refractive errors, optical surgery, and medical conditions. Human subjects stared at a white piece of paper with bright lights on it to bleach the pigment from their retinas and then the main lights were turned off and a small low level light illuminated the paper. The paper was turned and the subject read the six letters on the page when they became clear. The time it took their eye to adapt was recorded. <br><br> The first hypothesis that older subject groups will have slower adaptation times was accepted. <br><br> The second hypothesis that refractive errors will cause adaptation times to be slower than the all subjects group, was rejected. It was speculated that the subjects with refractive errors had eye exams and were wearing their corrective lenses.<br><br> The third hypothesis that subjects with optical surgeries will have slower adaptation times than the all subjects group was accepted for the radial keratotomy group, and rejected for all other groups.<br><br> The fourth hypothesis that medical conditions will have slower adaptation times than the all subjects group was accepted for the diabetes and high blood pressure groups and rejected for the color vision deficient group.

EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE ON BREAST CANCER CELLS
Christine K Tchounwou
Madison Central High School, Madison, MS

My project involves the use of glucose and MCF-7 cells or beast cancer cells. For my project, there were 4 experiments or methods conducted. The first method was cell culture where the cells were grown for the rest of experimentation. They were grown in a flat bottom plate. The next method was the Trypan Blue Exclusion test where the standard live dead procedure was conducted to test the cells viabilty at different glucose concentrations(0,5,10,40,80 mg/ml) for 1 hour and 2 hours. The third method was the MTT assay where the cells viability was tested electronically using a spectrometer and a microplate reader. The last method was the Comet Assay where the cells' DND damage was recorded at each of the glucose concentrations. After, I concluded that glucose was harmful to the cells at high dosages and also caused DND damage.

THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF HKA ON PROSTATE CANCER LINE DU145 IS MEDIATED BY BLOCKING INTERACTION OF EGFR AND UPAR
Paul Tran
The Preuss School at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA

PURPOSE: Prostate Cancer occurs when growth factors, such as bFGF, bind to its receptors, and sends a transactivation signal to EGFR and uPAR, resulting in the clustering of EGFR and uPAR. This increases Cyclin D1 expression and facilitates migration of prostate cancer cells. Cleaved high molecular weight kininogen [HKa], a plasma protein, induces apoptosis of proliferating epithelial cells and inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. The purpose of this experiment was to prevent the metastasis of prostate cancer cells through implementation of HKa. HKa would bind to uPAR and prevent the transactivation signaling from growth factors to EGFR, resulting in the inhibition of metastasis of prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Sub-cultured Prostate Caner DU145 cells into six 35mm2 dishes coated with 1mL Collagen [10ug/mL] until monolayer formed. Measured metastasis of Prostate Cancer DU145 cells in vitro through Migration Assay. 3 dishes were Control. 3 dishes were HKa Treated. Added 6.09uL HKa to HKa Treated dishes. Added 2mL Pure Media with Zn2+ and 2uL bFGF to each dish. Incubated each dish at 37C for 24 hours. After incubation, fixed tumor cells with 2mL Formalin Solution and incubated at 4C. Pictures of each migration line were taken at 0 and 24 hours to show contrast/growth of cells in the Control and HKa Treated dishes. RESULTS: EGFR and uPAR co-localized on the surface cells in response to bFGF. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that HKa disrupted co-localization of EGFR and uPAR, indicating that HKa prevented transactivation signaling from growth factors to EGFR. HKa inhibited migration of DU145 cells at 24 hours by the Migration Assay. A monoclonal antibody against uPAR also blocked migration of DU145 cells at 24 hours by the Migration Assay. It suggested that HKa inhibited migration of tumor cells by targeting uPAR. CONSLUSION: HKa disrupted the interaction of EGFR and uPAR and inhibited migration of Prostate Cancer DU145 cells across migration line. It indicates that HKa might prevent metastasis of human Prostate Cancer.

DESERT DESICCANT: LOW HUMIDITY THERAPY FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN RELIEF?
Mary Lucia Leone Hedberg
North Attleborough High School, North Attleboro, MA

Anecdotal correlations between high desert weather and arthritis pain reduction exist; however, in scientific literature, empirical correlations among temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, and relative arthritis pain levels are scarce. This project examined weather differences between Boston and Albuquerque and identified humidity as having the most consistent correlation with the anecdotal arthritis pain levels associated with each city. A device to create a low humidity environment around an arthritic hand was developed and then tested to determine its efficacy in reducing arthritis pain.<br><br> <br><br> Experimentation identified the optimal desiccant as silica gel; effective, safe, inexpensive, and easily regenerated in a household dryer. A “Dry-Mitt” containing several silica gel packets within a waterproof outer shell was designed to enclose the arthritic hand. Identical ‘placebo’ packets containing sand were also developed for use as an experimental control.<br><br> <br><br> A single-blind human subject protocol was designed with the assistance of a rheumatologist who allowed this researcher to meet with and distribute the Dry-Mitt devices to his hand arthritis patients. Patients wore active and placebo mitts for 4 days each and, using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), recorded relative pain level four times per day.<br><br> <br><br> The data collected reveals a greater correlation between reduced arthritis pain and the use of the active Dry-Mitt, as compared to the placebo. These results strongly warrant continued development and testing of this device to further characterize and understand patient response to silica gel therapy. The Dry-Mitt could become the preferred non-invasive means to relieve debilitating arthritis pain.

LINEARITY AND SENSITIVITY OPTIMIZATION OF IMPLANTABLE GLUCOSE SENSORS USING LAYER BY LAYER OUTER MEMBRANES
Riya Goyal
Harrison High School, Harrison, NY

It has been determined that through the use of continuous glucose sensing and adequate insulin therapy, the complications of diabetes as well as the costs of treatment can be reduced. Six implantable amperometric glucose sensors were fabricated utilizing a 50-um platinum wire followed by immobilization of the glucose oxidase enzyme. Sequential adsorption of various ionic species via a layer-by-layer process created devices created with bilayers of humic acids/ferric cations (HAs/Fe3+), humic acid/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (HAs/PDDA), poly(styrene sulfonte)/PDDA (PSS/PDDA) a well as the same combinations coated with poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA). The in vitro amperometric response of the sensors was determined at 0.7 V versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in phosphate-buffered saline (37°C) for various glucose concentrations. The effect of different layer combinations on the linearity and sensitivity of the sensors was analyzed. Although there was no correlation between the combination of layers with and without PVA, the combination of HAs/PDDA displayed the highest sensitivity while the combination of HAs/PDDA/PVA exhibited the longest sensor linearity.

HERBAL HEALTH IV: THE APPLICATION OF MATRICARIA RECUTITA WITH RESPECT TO A CACO3 IN THE ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE
Tonia Gooden
Algonac High School, Algonac, MI

This experiment in its current structure investigates the acidity reducing properties of Matricaria recutita and CaCO3. This data was used to determine which substance would provide a better treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.<br><br> The project was carried out by mixing each substance individually with hydrochloric acid (molar 6). Once mixed, the new solution’s pH was measured again and compared to the baseline pH of -.93. An increase in pH value would suggest a decrease in acidity. The pH was measured with a calibrated glass electrode sensor. <br><br> On average the Matricaria recutita was found to increase the pH to -.784, or an average increase of .146. Conversely, the CaCO3 increased the pH to -.85, on average, which corresponded to a .08 average increase. Thus, the conclusion can be drawn that the Matricaria recutita further reduced the acidity of the hydrochloric acid. This occurred because the Matricaria recutita was able to infuse the acid with carbon, which absorbed the acid and gave a byproduct of CO2. Furthermore, the Matricaria recutita provided the acid with more oxygen, which created a byproduct of H20. These byproducts seemingly helped reduce the acidity, whereas with the CaCO3, there was only a small influx of carbon and oxygen.<br><br> This investigation directly correlates with gastroesophageal reflux disease by simulating stomach acid with the hydrochloric acid. Each substance would have been used individually to reduce the acidity of stomach acid. Thus, my conclusions suggest that Matricaria recutita would perform well as a treatment for excess acid in the stomach.

THE ESTROGENICITY AND PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY OF A COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED POLLUTANT, BISPHENOL A, ON HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELL LINES
Michael Edward Carlos Williams
Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School, Pittsburgh, PA

Bisphenol A, a widely distributed and commonly occurring estrogen-like pollutant, arises from plastics manufacturing. Cancers of the breast are known to have many different causes. Stimulation of the naturally occurring receptors for estrogen in some breast cells is one of these mechanisms. My hypothesis in this project was that the pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) would cause increased proliferative activity in a cell line (MCF-7) grown from a female breast cancer that is positive for the estrogen receptor.<br><br> I measured this activity as a Proliferation Index (PI) using a Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The Cell Proliferation Assay quantifies viable cells by measuring light absorption changes related to enzymatic activity in the cytoplasm, and is performed in 96 well micro-titration plates. I employed a cell line (BT-20) negative for estrogen receptors as a negative control. Both cell lines were tested against eight (8) graduated concentrations of BPA using negative (culture medium) and positive (estradiol) internal controls.<br><br> My results demonstrated a statistically significant increased PI for the higher concentrations of BPA in the estrogen receptor positive (MCF-7) cell line. There was no influence of the BPA on the estrogen receptor negative (BT-20) line. The response curve in the positive line was "biphasic", in a response pattern known to be associated with estrogen effect.<br><br> This experiment demonstrated that Bisphenol A increases proliferative activity in a human breast cancer cell line positive for the estrogen receptor and may be contributing to the incidence of breast cancer through this mechanism. Animal testing may be warranted.

I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT, TWO! A MODEL FOR CALCULATION OF TREATMENT TIME FOR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
Romita Sur
Hillfield-Strathallan College, Hamilton

Treatment time calculation for patients receiving Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for skin cancers is based on light beam diameter, power (irradiance) and fluence. This results in irregular measurements and treatment time, as the patient’s tumor surface is irregular. This project developed an accurate way to calculate treatment time by finding a relationship between source distance and irradiance. <br><br>Firstly, irradiance was measured at the beam center for different distances by mounting the detector on an optical slide across the microfiber lens of a Diomed laser unit. The results were graphed to obtain an equation for treatment time as a function of distance. Secondly, using the same optical slide and a clipboard, the beam diameter was recorded for different distances. Data was graphed to find an equation for distance as a function of area. The results were modeled to obtain an equation for treatment time utilizing the variables involved. <br><br> <br><br>Irradiance of the PDT laser as a function of distance had a non-linear relationship described by 1/d2 (d =radius of circle). For a 100 mW beam, treatment time was calculated by the equation T(s)= 200000(0.0496D+0.0701)2 where D=light source to surface distance. [200 mW, T(s)=200000(0.0344D+0.0451)2]. Diameter and distance relationship was linear. If distance is known, beam diameter can be determined. The treatment time equation is based on laser’s irradiance and is more accurate than if based on the beam’s area.<br><br>Clinical significance: These equations and model have now been adopted by the local cancer center to calculate treatment time for PDT accurately, quickly and non-invasively.

PROGRAMMING A NETWORK APPROACH TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF EPIDEMICS, SECOND YEAR STUDY
Nolan M.K. Kamitaki
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

A computer simulation was designed to model epidemics within a scale-free social network. This network-based system was developed due to flaws in a previous particle-based simulation. This new simulation investigated how viral characteristics and distributing medical supplies based on social links affect an epidemic’s spread. Settings for modeling influenza were used to determine the most effective age group distribution of medical supplies. 12,500 test runs were completed and 1.25•10^11 random numbers were generated. Visual C++ and Dev-C++ were development environments used to program the simulation.<br><br> Results showed increasing infectivity and duration characteristics, while decreasing the case fatality rate increased the mortality rate. This reflects actual diseases, because many efficient diseases linger or transmit easily without killing many vectors. The social link-based distribution showed antiviral and isolation distribution effectiveness proportionally increased as people with more social links were sought. <br><br> An infectivity setting was matched to influenza’s estimated reproductive number of approximately 1.4 to 2.2. Using an infectivity of 45%, age-based distribution testing found children to be the most effective recipients of medical processes for high case fatality rate influenza. However, supplies should be divided between children and elderly for low case fatality rate influenza; children are effective for prevention, but once infected, elderly are more important because they have the highest case fatality rate. Coupled with social-link-based distribution testing, this confirmed previous results. <br><br> Switching to a network model improved the quality and accuracy of data results. The evolving nature of viruses makes planning for epidemics via computer simulations a promising choice.

IS GERD THE WORD? WHICH UPPER-GI SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS TAKING PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS ARE CAUSED BY GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE? YEAR TWO OF AN ONGOING STUDY ON THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
Michael Christian Green
South Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools, Cayce, SC

The purpose of this project was to discover which upper-gastrointestinal symptoms in patients taking proton pump inhibitors twice a day are caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). I predicted that indigestion, heartburn, and regurgitation would be caused by gastroesophageal reflux in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, while chest pain and nausea would not be caused by reflux in these patients.<br><br> To test my hypothesis, I retrospectively analyzed 200 consecutive ambulatory Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance and pH (MII-pH) studies which were performed on 200 acid-suppressed patients between January 2005 and October 2006. I examined each study in order to discover which upper-GI symptoms had occurred in these patients, and which of these symptoms had been caused by gastroesophageal reflux. I analyzed each symptom independently and made tables showing which symptoms had been caused by gastroesophageal reflux. If a reflux episode preceded a symptom by less than five minutes for 50% or more of the time in a patient, the symptom was considered to be caused by gastroesophageal reflux in that patient.<br><br> I found that regurgitation and heartburn were caused by gastroesophageal reflux in acid-suppressed patients 50% and 48.5% of the time, respectively, while indigestion, chest pain, and nausea were caused by reflux 33.3%, 33.3%, and 27.6% of the time, respectively. This confirmed my prediction that regurgitation and heartburn were more likely to be caused by reflux than chest pain and nausea, but it refuted my prediction that indigestion was more likely to be caused by gastroesophageal reflux than other upper-GI symptoms.

IDENTIFICATION OF AN EARLY DETECTION METHOD FOR OVARIAN CANCER UTILIZING THE HONEYBEE (APIS MELLIFERA) OLFACTORY SYSTEM
Rajiv Jaisimha Iyengar
Bellarmine Preparatory High School, Tacoma, WA

Honeybees (Apis mellifera) can be taught to associate odors with a sucrose reward in a classical conditioning assay utilizing the proboscis extension reflex (PER). This study examined finer measures of PER such as latency and proboscis to head size ratio to determine the ability of honeybees to discriminate between the urine of patients with either stage 3 or 4 ovarian cancer tumors and the urine of healthy age-matched controls. Latency, defined as the time taken for a given bee to respond to a urine odor, quantified certainty of response, while proboscis to head size ratio, defined as the percent ratio between the proboscis extension and head size of the bee, quantified strength of response. A major goal of this study was to determine whether any biomarkers from the cancer would appear in the urine in a form that the bees could discriminate that might effectively identify candidates for more in-depth cancer tests. By implementing more stringent criteria for an acceptable PER based on latency and proboscis to head size ratio, discrimination ability of the honeybees significantly improved resulting in a reduction of the overall false positive response rate (responses to the control urine odor) from 64.6% to 37.5% thereby increasing the clinical viability of this discrimination technique.

ROLE OF PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4B (PDE4B) ENZYME IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF HYPERTENSION
Faraz Ahmed Khan
Northside College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL

Hypertension afflicts more than 50 million Americans and 500 million people worldwide with the cause unknown in 95% of the cases. The purpose of this project was to observe the possible role of phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) enzyme in the possible control of hypertension. It was hypothesized that PDE4B may be increased in salt sensitive hypertension, decreasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)and thereby increasing blood pressure. <br><br> The experiment was carried out using Western blotting techniques that include gel electrophoresis (to separate the proteins out), transfer (to move proteins from gel to nitrocellulose membrane), hybridization with PDE4B specific antibody (antiPDE4B Polyclonal antibody to help detect PDE4B), and autoradiography (visualization of immunoblot gel). <br><br> It was found in this experiment that there is a larger concentration of PDE4B4 in salt sensitive rats as compared to the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the salt resistant rats (SR), entailing greater cAMP degradation. This could mean that there is decreased beta-adrenergic signaling, suggesting increased muscle contractility in the blood vessels increasing blood pressure. Also lower levels of cAMP have been associated with less active sodium/potassium ion pumps, which may cause increased muscle contractility in blood vessels, entailing higher blood pressure. The activity of sodium/potassium pumps are also directly related to aldosterone levels, so PDE4B4 may be indirectly changing aldosterone levels, affecting blood pressure.

THE ROLE OF PAK ON CX43 DEPHOSPHORYLATION
Aiyang Jiang
Whitney Young High School, Chicago, IL

Heart failure (HF) is a deadly illness; Over 5 million American are suffering from HF, and 550,000 new cases occur annually. Sudden cardiac death causes over 50% of heart failure patients' deaths, and ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation are the major causes of those deaths. Changed phosphorylation status of Cx43 protein was found to be associated with increased P21-activated kinases (PAK1 & PAK2) and impaired cell coupling. This then leads to sudden cardiac death in HF. However, the mechanisms of this is still unclear, therefore the current studies explored the mechanism of PAK dephosphorylating Cx43 through activating Protein Phosphatase Type 2A (PP2A) with the idea of developing a potential treatment target for preventing sudden cardiac death in HF in mind. <br><br> To explore the relationship between Cx43, PP2A, and PAK proteins, immunoprecipitation, western blots, and PP2A activity assays were used on HEK293-Cx43 cells with active PAK1 or inactive PAK2 (PAK2 Dominant Negative) proteins over-expression. J Image and Prism softwares were used to quantify and analyze the data.<br><br> The data showed that an over-expression of active PAK1 protein led to an increase in PP2A activity and Cx43 dephosphorylation. In contrast, the over-expression of inactive PAK2 did not change the level of dephosphorylated Cx43. In addition, PAK1 was associated with Cx43 and PP2A proteins, indicating interactions between these proteins. The data strongly suggest that the PAK proteins are responsible for dephosphorylating Cx43 through modulating PP2A activity. These findings could be used as a starting point for development of therapeutic targets to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in HF, and could save the lives of many HF patients.

MULTI-MODAL IMAGING PROBES FOR IN VIVO DETECTION OF LYMPHOID CANCERS
Zachary Jason Stauber
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, CA

Manganese doped silicon nanoparticles are fluorescent nanoparticles that hold great potential for their applications in biological imaging. They are optimal for biological applications because of their non-toxicity and resistance to photobleaching, a common problem for organic fluorophores that limits their use in vivo applications. In addition, the use of manganese as a dopant provides the silicon nanoparticles with paramagnetism that is detectable using an MRI. Through the conjugation of LLP2A, a peptidomimetic compound with picomolar sensitivity to the alpha 4 beta 1 integrin found on the surface of lymphoma cells, the nanoparticles can attach to lymphoma cells and illuminate these cells. The manganese doped silicon nanoparticles were chemically synthesized for their specific use in lymphoma detection and were then conjugated to LLP2A to create “targeted” manganese doped silicon nanoparticles. Jurkat cells were incubated with targeted manganese doped silicon nanoparticles and imaged with confocal microscopy. Cell toxicity studies were performed and showed the non-toxicity of the targeted manganese doped silicon nanoparticles and relaxivity studies were performed to show the magnetic properties of the manganese doped silicon nanoparticles. The particles are multi-modal and are to be used to help diagnose and treat lymphoma. An MRI will be used to locate regions of cancer throughout the body and then the fluorescence will assist surgeons in the identification of tumor margins. These results provide the first evidence showing that the targeted manganese doped silicon nanoparticles could be used in the in vivo diagnosis and treatment of humans with lymphoid and other cancers.

EFFECTS OF THE MIXTURE OF CHEWING MINTS AND LEMON FLAVOR CARBONATED SODA DRINK IN AN ARTIFICIAL MODEL OF THE HUMAN STOMACH
Heidy Ann De Jesus-Pagan
Fernando Callejo Ferrer, Manati, PUERTO RICO

This investigation studied what was the effect of mixing lemon flavor carbonated soda drink and some chewing mints in a series of human stomach models. It was interesting to know if the resulting reaction could be dangerous to the human health. The hypothesis under study was that the mixture of lemon flavor carbonated soda drink and chewing mints will cause a strong reaction, when are combined with saliva and hydrochloric acid at 1%, which is the same concentration of this acid found in the human stomach. The four human stomach models contained the same amount of lemon flavor carbonated soda drink and hydrochloric acid at 1%. Models one and two were the control group. Model 1 was at 50ºF, while model 2 was at room temperature. In these models, the chewing mints added to them were not chewed (did not contain saliva or salivary amylase).Models three and four were the experimental group. Model 3 was at 50ºF, while model 4 was at room temperature and for both models the added chewing mints were chewed (did contain saliva or salivary amylase). The result obtained was that the strongest reaction occurred in model 4, as indicated by a lot of froth that raised in the bottle. This model had saliva and was at a higher temperature. It was concluded that the mixture of these substances at room temperature produced a strong reaction as it was stated in the hypothesis. This can be harmful if it happens in a human stomach.

INFLUENCES OF CENTRAL EXCITATORY NEUROTRANSMISSION MEDIATED FREE RADICALS ON BRAIN BLOOD FLOW
Emily Yuan-Shuan Liu
Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, WA

NMDA receptor activation contributes to cerebral blood flow (CBF) increase initiated by synaptic activity via NO. NMDA receptor activation also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to test the coupling between NMDA receptor-mediated NO/ROS and CBF increase, I focused on transduction pathways underlying NMDA-induced CBF. Neocortical application of NMDA increased CBF of mice, assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry, and ROS, assessed with hydroethidine. NMDA-mediated CBF and ROS increases were blocked by nNOS inhibitor 7-NI and were absent in nNOS-/- mice. ROS production but not CBF increase was blocked by ROS scavenger MnTBAP and was absent in mice lacking NADPH oxidase subunit Nox2 (gp91phox). SGC inhibitor ODQ and PKG inhibitor KT-5823 attenuated the CBF and ROS increases. Nox2 and NMDA NR1 receptor were found expressed in cortical neurons. NMDA increased ROS and NO release assessed by carbon fiber amporemetry. NMDA-induced ROS were blocked by MnTBAP, NOS inhibitor L-NNA, Nox2 inhibitor gp91ds, ODQ or KT-5823. My results suggest that (1) NMDA receptor activation increases CBF and ROS via nNOS-derived NO; (2) the ROS were derived from Nox2 NADPH oxidase; (3) neuronal NO is a critical factor mediating the functional hyperemia; (4) cGMP-dependent PKG participates in regulation of Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase.

GOT MILK? GOT BONE DENSITY?
Juliette Luann Keller
Kouts High School, Kouts, IN

In my science fair project, I proved that the more milk that you drink, the better your bone density is. First, I made a survey asking bone density patients how much milk that they drink in a day, when, if they liked it or didn’t, etc, plus their age and sex. Then, the results for the bone density tests and doctors diagnoses were attatched to the survey. I compared each question on my survey to their t-scores, z-scores, and bone mineral density (BMD) to find my results. People who were older obviously had lowers scores than the younger patients. I found out that people who liked milk had higher t-scores, z-scores, and BMD than people who disliked it. Also, people who drank three or more glasses of milk per day had extremely high z-scores compared to those who drank two glasses or less. In my survey I asked the patients which age group of their life that they drank the most milk. My results showed that people who drank more milk when they were in their 40s and 50s had higher t-scores than those who drank more milk when they were young. I find this interested because many people think that when you are young is the time to drink milk, but according to my results you should drink milk all throughout your life to prevent from osteopenia, osteoporosis, or any other related bone diseases.

SODIUM CARBONATE VS. COLGATE'S DETERGENTS
Faith Skilee Martinez
Carbon High School, Price, UT

Hypothesis: The Sodium Carbonate in Crest Extra Whitening will have a more dramatic whitening affect than the Colgate Total plus Whitening. The purpose is to compare the Sodium Carbonate within the Crest Extra Whitening to the various detergents within the Colgate Total plus Whitening for the whitening affects on teeth. <br><br> There will be two groups of subjects three for the Crest experiment and three for the Colgate experiment, a total of six individuals. The procedure is as follows: Group one- brush with Colgate Total plus Whitening for two weeks, twice daily for two minutes. Group two- brush with Crest Extra Whitening for two weeks, twice daily for two minutes. There will be before and after pictures taken of the subjects teeth and a professional dental hygienist will help in verifying the exact color of their teeth. The data that is collected did show that my hypothesis is incorrect; Colgate Total proves to whiten three times more affectively while maintaining teeth: fighting cavities, tartar, gingivitis, plaque, bad-breath bacteria, and mold that may grow on teeth. <br><br> In conclusion, Colgate Total plus Whitening works more affectively than Crest Extra Whitening at teeth whitening and maintaining teeth.

THE EFFICACY OF FOUR MATERIALS IN PREVENTING HYPOTHERMIA
Hilary Marie Grabowska
Jefferson High School, Shenandoah Junction, WV

The purpose of this project was to determine which emergency blanket would best prevent hypothermia.<br><br> This experiment involved wrapping four glass bottles each with a different type of emergency blanket (Blizzard, Space, Fleece or Wool). The bottles were filled with 445mL of water at room temperature. They were then placed in hypothermic conditions, temperatures between 0ºC-10ºC. Every thirty minutes, for two hours, the temperatures were observed and recorded. <br><br> The hypothesis was that the Blizzard Blanket would keep the water warmest. This was based on the results of a preceding experiment, in which cardboard was the best insulator and the Blizzard Blanket's structure is similar to cardboard.<br><br> The results of the experiment show that all four emergency blankets are equally effective during a two-hour test period. <br><br> Improvements to this experiment might include the use of more precise thermometers so that a more exact reading could be recorded. Additionally, a model that more closely resembles a human being could be used to determine if the blankets can actually prevent hypothermia in human subjects.<br><br> This experiment is important and useful because hypothermia is a dangerous condition that can be prevented. This experiment shows that any of the four tested blankets insulate equally. Winter emergency kits could include any one of them. A person could decide which blanket to include based upon price, size, weight and how easily it can be packed.

THE EFFECTS OF PIP2 ON INTRACELLULAR PH REGULATION
Clare Ruth Gamlin
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

The purpose of this project was to research the general question "How does PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate) affect intracellular pH regulation?" Specific questions addressed in this project were: Can DNA constructs that encode fluorescent-tagged enzymes that alter PIP2 levels be chemically transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells successfully? Do the fluorescent-tagged proteins redistribute to the plasma membrane of the cell after adding iRap? Can a fluorescence-based transfection that influences PIP2 levels be used with a fluorescent pH-sensitive dye? Does an increased level of PIP2 affect the recovery rate of an HEK cell after an acid load?<br><br>HEK cells were cultured and grown on coverslips. Once on coverslips, they were chemically transfected with DNA constructs. Approximately 48-72 hours post-transfection, the cells were viewed and photographed. To obtain images, the cells were exposed to light at specific wavelengths that excited the fluorescent proteins produced from the transfection. A computer-operated camera photographed the cells. The images were then analyzed using a computer program, which provided quantitative data regarding pH and levels of fluorescence.<br><br>The chemical transfection was successful, producing fluorescence in both the positive control and the experimental group. After adding iRap, some redistribution was observed. The fluorescent pH-sensitive dye was absorbed by all of the cells, making the fluorescence of the transfected and untransfected cells indistinguishable. After adding Saponin, the pH sensitive dye left the cells, but the transfected cells continued to fluoresce. After an acid load, the cells with increased levels of PIP2 had slower recovery rates than the untransfected cells.

INVESTIGATION OF EFFECT OF CHEMICAL SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS ON STABILITY AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF PROTEIN-BASED THERAPEUTICS
Rahul Mahendra Varman
Creighton Preparatory School, Omaha, NE

Recently, there are some reports regarding enhancing transdermal delivery of proteins by a co-administered peptide, however, the amount transported is not sufficient for eliciting therapeutic effect. An ideal enhancer should be pharmacologically inactive; a nonirritant, compatible with peptide/protein-based therapeutics, and should not damage the skin irreversibly. This project investigated the effects of terpene-based skin penetration enhancers, known to be non-toxic to skin, on the chemical and conformational stability and biological activity of a model protein lysozyme so that we can have a list of potential enhancers optimal for use in transdermal formulation of protein. Chemical enhancers were added to the model protein lysozyme solution in the concentration range generally used in transdermal formulations (5, 6, and 7% w/V) and kept for 4 and 24 h (the time a transdermal patch normally remains) for investigating conformational stability profiles and biological activity. Fourier transform infra-red spectrophotometer was used to analyze different secondary structures like a-helix, b-sheet, b-turn, and random coil. Biological activity of lysozyme was determined by measuring decrease in A450 when it was added to a suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. The results of this study indicate that terpene 6 (L-Fenchone) can be a better skin penetration enhancer than other terpenes used in this study for the purpose of increasing transport of a protein in a transdermal formulation. However, its interaction with protein at molecular level would be undertaken in future study to understand the mechanisms which will help us to design a novel even more efficient enhancer.

A CELL-SPECIFIC APPROACH FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TARGETED THERAPY OF ORAL CANCER
Ashwathi Sarayu Mohan
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Head and Neck Cancer causes one death each year in the US due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.<br><br>In response to these conditions, HN-4 peptide was developed four years ago. In the first year, HN-4's specificity and internalization capabilities towards Squamous Cell<br><br>Carcinoma was proven. In year two, HN-4's diagnostic abilities were tested by tagging the peptide to radionuclides like Copper-64 and Technetium-99m and by injecting the conjugates into immunocompromised rats. Observed by positron emission tomography imaging and gamma camera imaging, this study proved that HN-4 can function as an effective diagnostic device. Last year, HN-4's localization in the cytoplasm of the cell, its 24hr retention at the tumor site, its minimal retention in the surrounding organs, and its active transport method of cell internalization were determined. This year, HN-4 peptide was developed into an effective treatment method for head and neck cancer. It was hypothesized that by tagging HN-4 peptide with liposomes carrying anti-cancer agents, a cell-specific drug delivery package could be created, providing for an efficient and highly targeted treatment approach for the cancer. HN-4 peptide was tagged with PEG lipid and stored at 4 degrees C until post-insertion into the liposomes. The liposomes were created by combining the lipids DPPC, DMPG, and PEG with chloroform, dessicating the mixture overnight to make a lipid film, rehydrating the lipid film with 10% sucrose solution and Calcein, sizing the liposomes to l00nm by extrusion, and centrifuging and storing the liposomes by freeze-drying, or lyophilization. The liposomes were tested in SCC head and neck cancer cells and were observed after 6hrs. Results showed sporadic uptake of the liposomes, proving nonspecific internalization and the need for a cell-specific agent like HN-4 peptide. Post-insertion of the peptide in the liposomes and the functions of the drug delivery package will be studied based on this data.

THE EFFECT OF FLI1 GENE EXPRESSION LEVELS ON INDUCED NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE IN LUPUS
Julia Elizabeth Killingsworth
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

Fli1 (Friend Leukemia Integration 1) gene affects the level of transcription of many genes and may be the genetic cause of lupus activity. The gene may be increasing the rate of activity in lupus patients through changes in iNOS(induced nitric oxide synthase) activity. iNOS, which catalyzes NO production, is highly expressed in mouse models of lupus and in macrophages during an inflammatory response . Lupus prone mice with reduced Fli1 gene by 50% had decreased autoantibodies and increased survival rate (Zhang, 2006). The hypothesis is that increased levels of the Fli1 gene will affect the level of iNOS protein expression during lupus activity. The two ways used to study the effects of Fli1 gene on iNOS expression were in vivo (by researcher) and in vitro. Murine mice that spontaneously developed lupus and overproduced NO were used to measure products of nitric oxide production when one of the Fli1 alleles was inactivated. Then mesangial cells were used to measure iNOS expression and NO production for different amounts of Fli1 transfected into the cells. Since the hypothesis is that Fli1 may contribute to lupus activity, it was expected that mice with the wild type (homozygote) of Fli1 would have significantly higher levels of nitrate and nitrite (a surrogate measure of NO) than the heterozygote mice that had reduced Fli1 by 50%. The findings indicate that more Fli1 expression in mice increased NO production, but decreased iNOS gene transcription in cultured mesangial cells transfected with increasing amounts of Fli1. P-values from the statistics of NO production in vivo were not significant, but the p-values of statistics from iNOS promoter activity in vitro were significant. The hypothesis that Fli1 contributes to increased lupus activity, through iNOS are not supported by these results.

P53-DEPENDENT GROWTH INHIBITION OF PROSTATE CANCER BY WALNUT AND PECAN EXTRACTS
Micah Maetani
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI

The prevalence of prostate cancer is lower in the Mediterranean area than in the United States, and intake of fruits, vegetables, wine, and nuts is hypothesized to be associated with the decreased risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of raw, unprocessed samples of walnuts and pecans on human prostate carcinoma cells. Growth of cells was measured through an SRB dye-binding protocol. Methanolic walnut and pecan extracts substantially (p<0.001) inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells while reducing PC-3 cell growth to a far lesser extent. Furthermore, pecan extracts retained potency after 12 months, whereas walnut extracts lost 50% efficacy, and various bioassays indicate that the active constituent in both extracts is dissimilar. In addition, morphological changes were noticed with extract-treated LNCaP cells. While the extracts were previously found to induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells, apoptosis was not induced in PC-3 cells. Because PC-3 cells lack a functional p53 gene, the data suggest that the extracts induce apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway in LNCaP cells. This is supported by an increase in growth in extract-treated LNCaP cells previously transfected with siRNA to suppress p53 gene expression. Fractionated extracts have been run through an HPLC/LCMS instrument, and future research is necessary to isolate and characterize the active compound. In summary, the collected data indicate that p53 is critical in extract-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Additional study is needed in understanding the use of nut extracts as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of prostate cancer.

WHO GETS WELL? AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL OUTCOMES
Chloe J. Golden
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

The ultimate goal of epidemiological studies is to get the best possible health for the population as a whole. In the current study, the researcher gathered demographic data, death rates, behavioral choices, disease incidence, health status, and community information in Florida and in the US to see how these factors predicted medical outcome and disease rates. This was an archival study. Data from 10 publically available datasets with over 1000 variables were integrated to put together the sample. All analyses were performed on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences with data analysis performed at the individual. Census tract, and county levels. The results strongly supported the conclusion that there is extensive inequality in the outcome of medical care. The largest cause of the inequality was economic rather than lifestyle with death rates from specific disorders varying by up to 1000% or more. Income level and poverty were revealed as the major determination of medical outcome. Age and education were identified as secondary factors, while such variables as race, culture, living conditions, and lifestyle were all smaller contributors. Factors like race, ethnicity, culture, and geographic residence were minor factors in determining outcome when income and education were controlled. Individuals who engaged in one healthy behavior were more likely to engage in other healthy behaviors. Similarly, unhealthy behaviors lead to more unhealthy behavior. Life satisfaction, education, and income also played a major role in determining healthy behavior, but having a specific disease did not lead patients to adopt general healthy behaviors.

SURVIVIN CORRELATES WITH PROGNOSIS AND INHIBITS DRUG-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN EWING SARCOMA FAMILY TUMORS
Sappho Zoe Gilbert
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors (ESFT) are malignant, small, round tumor cells in bone and soft tissues. ESFTs constitute the second most common bone tumor in children; currently, poor prognoses necessitate more accurate and effective treatments. Survivin, an apoptosis inhibitor protein, lacks expression in normal tissues, but is expressed in a variety of human cancers. Its role in ESFT is unknown. This study evaluated the expression of survivin in relation to clinical outcome. Western blot analysis for survivin was performed with 23 paraffin-embedded tissues from patients with localized ESFT; 12 expressed survivin, while 11 did not. The patients expressing survivin had a statistically significant lower survival rate, demonstrating an important role of survivin in ESFT. Further experimentation involved down-regulation of survivin in ESFT cell lines by apoptosis-inducing drugs with antisense oligonucleotides specific to survivin mRNA. Survivin expression was reduced while increasing drug sensitivity. Drug sensitivity was decreased when the levels of survivin were restored in ESFT cells lacking survivin by transfection. This study reports the novel discoveries of survivin presence as a prognostic indicator and the combination of antisense oligonucleotides and drugs for effective treatment of ESFTs.

HOW DOES PEANUT ALLERGY AFFECT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF CHILDREN AND TEENS?
AnDrenetta Faith McQueen
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS

The purpose of this project is to find out what is inside a peanut that makes children and teens have allergic reactions. I, myself, am allergic to peanuts and I wanted to investigate the issue. My hypothesis is I think that it's the oil inside of a peanut that children and teens immune system cannot react to.<br><br>My procedure includes:<br><br>1. Researched information about a peanut.<br><br>2. An interview with Dr.Lamdon, allergy specialist, and he gave me viable information, I also gave surveys to teens and children.<br><br>3. Examined the peanut and found that it consists of oil which protein that are harmful to the individuals.<br><br>4. Compared the peanut with different food groups.<br><br>5. Made charts and graphs<br><br>6. Drew the conclusion<br><br>7. Research food products that contain peanuts.<br><br>8. Discussed ideas for further study and relate ways that these findings can be applicable for today's children and teens so that the allergic reactions can be prevented as often as possible.<br><br>In conclusion, my hypothesis was somewhat true. As I researched, the oil in a peanut, I found out that it is not the oil alone but also it is a protein that causes the allergic response. It makes them have overwhelming symptoms. The body reacts as if the nut or peanut is harmful. In an attempt to protect the body, the immune system produces antibodies (special chemicals designed to fight infections) against that food. I also found out how others live with allergies.<br><br>As of result of my experimentation, i found that boiled peanuts have less protein than roasted peanuts.

POTENTIAL ANTIBACTERIAL-IMMUNOBOOSTER COMPOUNDS FROM BARRINGTONIA ASIATICA (PUTAT LAUT) AND GARCINIA MANGOSTANA (MANGOSTEEN)
Steven Cuapoco Tan Tan
The Quantum Academy Inc., General Santos City, General Santos City, PHILIPPINES

This study was conducted to determine the potential use of Barringtonia asiatica seeds and Garcinia mangostana pulp extracts as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of bacterial infection and enhancement of the immune body response. The crude ethanol extracts from the two test plants were subjected to antibacterial assay using the Disc diffusion method against Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Result showed that both extracts have high antibacterial activities comparable to Streptomycin. Statistical test indicates that the result is significant at 1% level. <br><br>Further test was conducted to determine the toxicity effect of both extracts using brine shrimp lethality assay. Result showed that the toxicity of the extracts increases with concentration. However, this is not conclusive that all components of the extracts are all toxic. Phytochemical screening revealed that B. asiatica extract contains alkaloids, saponins and tannins while G. mangostana extract contains alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, saponins and tannins. <br><br>A biological test was done to determine the effect of both plant extracts in blood production. Results showed that mice treated with both extracts exhibited a significant increase in the White Blood Corpuscles (WBC) and blood platelet count. <br><br>Likewise, mice administered with combined Azathioprine and plant extracts displayed a remarkable improvement in their WBC and blood platelet count. This suggests that despite the presence of an immunosuppressant drug, Azathioprine, both plant extracts still exhibited strong immunobooster activity. <br><br>Extracts from B. asiatica and G. mangostana prove to be good sources of antibacterial and immunobooster compounds

A TIME TO DYE. . . INSULIN
Brittany Diane Lamb
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

The purpose of this project was to see if dyed insulin will work more efficiently than clear insulin. In dying the insulin it should reduce the risks of the wrong amount of insulin being injected into the patient due to air in the syringe because the air bubbles will become more visible. Management of diabetes depends on precise dosage delivery for better control of glucose levels.After producing a tartrazine (FD&C Yellow #5) dye 2 grams of Yellow #5 dye were injected into a vial of Humalog insulin. Then twenty-five trials of the visibility of air in both clear and dyed insulin were prepared. More insulin was slowly added into the syringes. Starting the trials with 5 units of a 3/10cc syringe and working my way up to 30 units of a 3/10cc. After all the trials were run the insulin was sent off to Amarillo to Dr. Fakhrul Ahsan to have the efficiency tested.The tests show that when the syringes are filled with the dyed insulin that is easier for the naked eye to see if air is present. Just to make sure these tests were accurate air was purposefully added into the syringes in the amount of 5 units (of a 3/10cc syringe) to make sure that the air in the syringe filled with clear insulin was more difficult to see. As for the efficiency of the clear versus dyed insulin the results from Dr. Ahsan’s testing shows that the dyed insulin did appear to have a greater affect on the rat’s glucose levels. Also, there seems to be no biological affects.

CHAINS OF INFECTION: A SEXUAL-NETWORK-BASED MODEL EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION ON INFECTION PREVALENCE IN AN ADOLESCENT POPULATION
Katie Elizabeth Everett
Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

This paper models the effect of vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) on infection prevalence to determine optimal vaccination strategies for either female-only vaccination or vaccination of both males and females. Recently published empirical data showing spanning trees as appropriate models of adolescent sexual networks contradict previous network models, such as cores, assumed in population-based infection models. In this paper, a novel simulation model creates sexual networks as individual relationships form over time, considering the effect of social norms governing partnership selection on network structure. Results show that moderate vaccination rates (20-40%) significantly reduce prevalence, but 90-95% vaccination of females, or 70-80% vaccination of both males and females is needed for herd immunity. Thus, HPV vaccination may be more effective than predicted by theoretical models that do not take the fragile nature of adolescent sexual network structure into consideration. Still, vaccination goals are not likely to be reached without mandatory vaccination of both males and females.

THE PREVALENCE OF SENSITIZATION OF RURAL, SMALL-CITY ALLERGY PATIENTS TO PERIPLANETA AMERICANA AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. NATIONAL AVERAGE
Annamaria Jo Inez Herrera
Evart High School, Evart, MI

Although sensitization to cockroach allergens and its correlation to asthma have been noted in urban populations, it has not been noted in rural populations. The primary objective of this study is the prevalence of sensitization to cockroach allergens in the rural population as compared to the national average. The secondary objective of this study is any possible correlations between the sensitized population and results of the statistical analysis (age, gender, and approximate age of dwelling of the sensitized population). Five hundred medical charts were randomly selected and reviewed for Skin Prick (SP) results, age, gender, and approximate age of dwelling. Of the 500 patients, 284 (58.6%) were found to be sensitized. The prevalence of sensitization in the rural population was significantly higher than the national average. No correlations were found between these results and those of the statistical analysis of the sensitized population. The results of this study hold implications for allergists nationwide, refuting the belief that patients in non-urban areas do not require evaluation for cockroach allergens.

FLAVONOID DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION: A STUDY ON THE TYPICAL INVERTEBRATE MODEL
Ryan Michael Newlon
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose was to determine the effect of the antioxidant flavonoid found in chocolate, (-)-epicatechin, on the indicator Daphnia magna. The hypothesis stated, “If Daphnia is exposed to (-)-epicatechin, then its heart rate, the number of eye twitches, and its nervous systems will slow.” The (-)-epicatechin was dissolved in water for testing. The flavonoid’s solubility peaked at 10mg/100mL of water. This concentration was used for testing as well as a concentration of 5mg/100mL. Five Daphnia were exposed to the catechin for five minutes before being tested for heart rate, number of eye twitches, appendage movements, and somersaults per minute, and interval between responses. The organisms were isolated in beakers and tested for the same parameters on the second and sixth days. Five other Daphnia were tested in a like manner but were exposed to the solution for five minutes before each test. At the 0.01% solution, the heart rate went up significantly on both first day tests (t=3.75>t0.01=3.355) (t=8.11>t0.001=5.041). The eye twitches went down significantly on the second day for repeated exposure (t=5.09>t0.001=5.041) and the second and sixth day for the single-exposure (t=6.09>0.001=5.041) and (t=5.32>t0.001=5.041), respectively. The interval between responses went down significantly for all first day tests at the 0.01% concentration (t=4.03>t0.01=3.355) (t=2.84>t0.05=2.365) and down significantly for all tests at 0.005% concentration (t=4.91>t0.01=3.355) (t=4.23>t0.01=3.355) (t=7.56>t0.001=5.041) (t=4.67>t0.01=3.355) (t=2.90>t0.05=2.306) (t=7.07>t0.001=5.401). The number of somersaults per minute went down significantly for all repeated-day exposures (t=4.05>t0.001=3.355) (t=5.43>t0.001=5.041) (t=3.58>t0.01=3.355) (t=6.75>t0.001=5.041) (t=6.98>t0.001=5.041) (t=7.9>t0.001=5.041). The hypothesis was supported for all tests except the heart rate.

LENS REFILLING FOR THE RESTORATION OF ACCOMMODATION AND NEAR-VISION IN HUMAN AND OTHER PRIMATE LENSES
Shane Douglas Mackey
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

Presbyopia is the symptomatic loss of the eye’s ability to change focus (accommodation) with age. It is hypothesized that accommodation can be restored by Phaco-Ersatz. This surgical procedure involves replacement of the lens contents with a polymer gel that has optical and mechanical properties similar to those of the young natural lens. The purpose of this experiment is to test the efficacy of various polymer gels developed to replace the natural lens contents. <br><br>The gels were tested on postmortem Homo sapiens (n=12), Macaca fascicularis (n=45), and Macaca mulatto (n=27) lenses. Accommodation was simulated by symmetrically stretching the tissue in a step-wise fashion from 0 to 4mm in diameter. The load, lens diameter, and power were measured at each step. The lens contents were then removed through a small opening in the lens capsule. A polymer gel was then inserted in the empty lens capsular bag. The stretching cycles were repeated, measuring the load, lens diameter, and power at each step. The natural and refilled responses were compared and quantified. <br><br>The results supported the hypothesis. Compared to natural lenses, refilled lenses have the same or better ability to accommodate (Homo sapiens 180%, Macaca fascicularis 111%, Macaca mulatto 94%). The refilled lenses require less force to change diameter than natural lenses (Homo sapiens 65%, Macaca fascicularis 92%, Macaca mulatto 94%). Less significantly different results were expected in the monkey lenses, due to the lack of old lenses tested.<br><br>Future studies will include the testing of additional Phaco-Ersatz gels with different viscosities and refractive indices.

AZT-INTERFERON ALPHA INDUCED GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES CORRELATE WITH CLINICAL RESPONSE OF HTLV-1 ATL PATIENTS
Chen Lossos
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, North Miami Beach, FL

Adult T-Cell Leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive malignancy of human T-Cells attributed to the retrovirus Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-1) infection. HTLV-1 encodes a Tax oncogene, an activator of the NF-kB pathway which initiates T-Cell transformation. However, the overall pathogenesis of HTLV-1 and its morphology into ATL remain largely unknown. No cure for ATL is presently known, resulting in a median life span of thirteen months after onset of acute leukemia or lymphoma type ATL. AZT-interferon alpha has been shown to be somewhat effective in treatment of ATL patients. Gene expression data of nine acute ATL patients, treated with AZT-interferon alpha were analyzed, with six patients analyzed before and after treatment. In addition, CGH was done on eight of the patients to analyze HTLV-1 induced gene expression changes. Cluster analysis of gene expression data revealed that samples responding to therapy displayed down regulation of cytoskeleton associated genes and increased expression of genes associated with proliferation. Interestingly, interferon induced genes were shown to be statistically significant markers of treatment response. This finding suggests that pharmacogenetic profiling of pre and post-treatment specimens may be useful for predicting response to AZT-interferon alpha treatment.

MICROBIAL ANTAGONISM, PHASE FOUR: THE SEARCH FOR A NEW ANTIBIOTIC FROM BACILLUS FLEXUS, A MICROBE ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN MICROBIOME
Andrew James Macgregor
Butte High School, Butte, MT

Discoveries of new antibiotics often emerge through the process of isolating the chemical compounds responsible for microbial antagonism, the competitive action of one microbe against another. In the human microbiome – the naturally occurring colonies of microbes that live in and on the human body – microbes protect the body from disease-causing pathogens. This project investigates whether a new antibiotic can be isolated from one of the body's own microbes.<br><br> In previous phases of this investigation, Bacillus flexus, a microbe with anti-pathogenic properties was isolated and identified. Once the chemical basis – as opposed to biological – of the anti-pathogenic properties was established, the student hypothesized that the chemical compound(s) responsible for the observed anti-pathogenic properties could be isolated.<br><br> Bioassay-guided fractionation – a natural products technique that alternates chromatography and biological testing – was used to isolate antipathogenic compounds from B. flexus. Compounds were isolated based on their polarity with silica gel chromatography, and molecular weight with TSK size exclusion chromatography. At the end of each chromatographic stage, fractions were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the data analyzed by another researcher who helped determine the chemical compounds contained in each. Based on NMR activity, antibiotic compounds appear to be peptidal antibiotics which may contain Tyrosine, Proline, Phenylalanine, and Valine. Finally, fractions were tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida tropicales. Fractions that proved effective against the pathogens continued to the next stage of chromatography.<br><br> These findings suggest the hypothesis was correct: the compound(s) responsible for antipathogenic activity is isolatable from B. flexus.

PULSE AND OVERALL HEALTH: HOW ARE THE TWO RELATED?
Jacob Encil Heissler
LaPlata R-2 High School, LaPlata, MO

This Year: My science fair project this year consists of how athletes and non-athletes pulse measurements were compared to determine the overall fitness level in all 10 participants. Also, on the health scale, where do their pulse measurements stand? I also didn’t take the age into affect. My topic stayed the same as last year, but it was altered in terms of muscles because they weren’t a factor in the overall health level for my current project. <br><br> A portion of my Literature Cited is listed. Your pulse rate is the rate at which your heart beats. Your bpm will be faster when you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress because if you are exercising, your heart has to do more work to meet the needs of your body. Likewise, it will slow when you are resting because your body is not moving or doing any work. <br><br> My Procedure is: First, I took the resting pulse rates of all my test subjects so that after the participants had already done the exercises I would have something to compare the pulse rates to. I took the resting pulse rate of the patients of the patients by allowing them to rest for at least 30 minutes, taking the pulse in their wrist for 15 seconds, and then I multiplied that by 4 so I could get a pulse rate of a minute. This is my pulse measurement process or PMP: pulse rate=15 seconds x 4. Athletic: #1-5; Non-athletic: #6-10. That is how I referred to them for the remainder of the project, in numbers. I determined which subjects would be in each group by picking 5 people who were currently participating in a high-school sport as being “athletic,” then picking 5 people who weren’t currently participating in any sports and I considered them as “non-athletes.” 2 exercises would be required for the project: push-up and sit-up exercises. All of the subjects would do 10 push-ups and 40 sit-ups. <br><br> My Results weren’t very surprising in being that the athletes’ pulse rates were lower in every category that was tested by a long shot; resting, sit-up, and push-up.<br><br> My Conclusion was: after having done these experiments involved in this project, I realized and discovered something very simple. Checking your pulse on a regular basis can give you a good insight into your health status.

TINY SHIELDS YIELD BIG RESULTS
Amber Lexxus Ferguson
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Everyday 20,000 people die of cancer, and last year 12 million new cases were diagnosed. More than 60% of cancer patients receive radiation making it the most widely used cancer therapy. Radiation not only destroys cancerous cells but also healthy cells, resulting in fatigue, damage to the skin, major organ damage, and loss of appetite. <br><br>With the addition of Cerium Oxide nanoparticles to a sample of cancerous and non-cancerous lung cells before radiation, healthy cell apoptosis can be greatly reduced without affecting the amount of cancerous cells destroyed. Two cell lines were cultured for this experimentation, a cancerous and a non cancerous lung cell line. When a sufficient amount of cells were cultivated they were divided into eight subgroups, some with radiation and some with nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were added and 20Gy of radiation was applied to those subgroups that warranted it. Samples were then analyzed using a Bioluminescent Assay, a Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay, and a CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay.<br><br>Healthy cell viability, as measured by a CellTiter-Glo Assay, was maintained through the addition of nanoparticles. A Caspase-Glo Assay demonstrated that cancerous cell apoptosis was still sustained. Cerium Oxide nanoparticles were successful in reducing the amount of healthy cell death during radiation while cancerous cells were still destroyed at the same rate. Recent technological advances in nanotechnology have established a therapy that may eliminate the side effects of radiation by protecting healthy cells. <br><br>

DO MEMBRANE RAFTS/CAVEOLAE MEDIATE SHEAR-INDUCED RHOA ACTIVATION?
Dalton Nathaniel Hughes
Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach, FL

Current research shows that shear stress stimulates the formation of stress fibers in the endothelial cell. RhoA is a key signaling molecule involved in this mechanotransduction process. Research has previously shown that membrane rafts and Caveolae mediate mechanotransduction responses that lead to cytoskeletal reorganization. Based on these findings, I hypothesized that Caveolae govern shear-induced actin stress fiber formation through the regulation of RhoA. To test this hypothesis, Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells (BAECs) were pretreated with Methyl-Beta-Cyclodextrin in order to disrupt membrane rafts and specifically the Caveolae. This was followed by exposure to laminar shear stress. RhoA activity was determined by a Rhotekin Binding Assay. There was a decrease in the amount of activated RhoA in the cylclodextrin treated cells in comparison to the control cells. The results of this experiment show that membrane rafts and Caveolae mediate shear-induced signaling within endothelial cells.

THE EFFECT OF THE TIMING OF THE APPLICATION OF A CONVECTIVE FORCED AIR WARMER ON THE AMOUNT OF BACTERIA PRESENT ON THE SKIN IN THE SURGICAL SITE
Alan Samuel Morell, Kelsey Hundley, 
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

The purpose of our experiment was to prove that the timing of the application of a convective forced air warmer to a surgical patient does not affect the amount of bacteria present on the surgical field. To test this hypothesis, we swabbed and cultured 7 different squares of skin on each of 8 different test subjects. Each skin square had a different combination of the warmer, prep solution and drape. (Square 1: no warmer, no prep, no drape; 2: no warmer, prep, no drape; 3: no warmer, prep, drape; A: warmer, no prep, no drape; B: warmer, prep, no drape; C: warmer, prep, drape; D: prep and draped before warmer is turned on) After all skin squares were cultured the cultures were incubated for 48 hours. The plates were observed and results were recorded at 24 and 48 hours. All plates that had chlorhexadine prep solution showed no microbial growth. The only plates that showed any bacterial colonization were 1 and A and there was no significant difference between those two groups. Our results demonstrated that the timing of the application of the convective forced air warmer does not affect the amount of bacteria on the surgical field. Therefore our null hypothesis was proven. Hence the warming device can safely be applied prior to the surgical prep. Doing so decreases the risk of perioperative hypothermia and vasoconstriction, and further reduces the risk of complications including post operative wound infections.

INHIBITING THE PROGRESSION OF HUNTINGTON’S DISEASE IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Sonika N Reddy, Sonya Jooma, 
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, GA

The project explored inhibiting the progression of Huntington’s disease in C. elegans through the use of the antioxidants Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Ginkgo biloba, Green tea extract, Niacin, Omega 3 fish oil, , and Vitamin C. The purpose of this project was to find substances that have the ability to inhibit progression of neurodegeneration in the genetic disorder, Huntington’s disease.<br><br> Research by Nick and Lieberman indicates antioxidants prevent cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. It was hypothesized that Niacin, shown to have high antioxidant activity, would be the most effective in preventing neurodegeneration due to success in previous scientific studies by the Chicago’s Rush Institute for Healthy Ageing.<br><br> In order to complete this experiment, C. elegans was grown overnight with the substances on E. coli OP50 lawns which served as food. After 24 hours, the nose-touch assay was completed on ten worms from each plate five times and their responses were evaluated; the number of responses out of the five trials signified the progression of their neurodegeneration. The data was compared to the control and the hypothesis was disproved; Green tea extract was the most effective inhibitor of Huntington’s with a nose-touch response average 1.067 greater than the control. The result for Green tea was found to be statistically significant meaning its success in inhibiting Huntington’s was not by chance.

THE EFFECTS OF LANTUS INSULIN ON DIABETIC PATIENTS
Cassandra Mary Nicotra, Sonja Bree, 
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

Information regarding 89 de-identified hospitalized diabetic patients (50 males and 39 females) was used for this experiment. Each of these patients received different dosages of Lantus Insulin, in addition to other insulin(s), specifically Novolin and Novolog. The hospital already randomly selected to give the patients Lantus in either the morning or evening. The Lantus was given once, at the same time, everyday for each patient. Data was collected and calculated about each patient, including gender, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), other insulins taken, dosage amount, and time of dosage. The hospital took each patient’s blood sugar level four times a day, and the amount of times each patient had an instance of hypoglycemia was recorded as well. The researchers performed linear regressions on the quantitative data collected versus the blood sugar levels. However, these regressions provided weak correlations due to the fact that all blood sugar levels recorded were below normal. The researchers created relative frequency graphs in order to compare the qualitative data. These graphs provided clear correlations between the variables. According to the overall results, Lantus was most effective in patients that were male, had a higher BMI, took 50 or more units of Lantus, and took Lantus in conjunction with one other insulin. The time of day the Lantus was given did not affect the insulin’s success, as long as it is consistent, because Lantus is a 24-hour slow release formula that does not have a peak time when blood sugar levels are abnormal.

DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS FIRST AID PACKAGE FOR AMPUTATION INJURIES
Frantisek Kolek, Vaclav Kocian, 
Gymnazium Josefa Ressela, Chrudim, Pardubicky Kraj, CZECH REPUBLIC

Some serious accidents contribute to amputation of body parts.<br><br>In these situations, both the afflicted person and the amputated part require sufficient medical care to make the reattachment possible. Unfortunately, in many cases of mass accidents, natural disasters or terrorist attacks, there are only a few doctors at hand and that is why essential quality medical care often comes too late.<br><br>For this purpose, we have developed a specific first aid package to preserve the amputated parts directly at the site of the accident and during the transport to the hospital. The package contains all the essential items for preserving the body wound as well as the amputated part. To complete this package, we have designed special container from LDPE sheeting; after filling with water its shape lends it stability. An effective and easy-to-use cooling system is based on the reaction of urea with water.<br><br>When testing technical and technological qualities of our package on artificial models, we have recorded, while the traditional way of amputation injury treatment requires 2-3 paramedics, with our set it can be performed by an untutored laic. In addition, various normally non-replantable amputation injuries were apt for reattachment. <br><br>We did not perform any invasive medical procedures on human subjects. Nowadays, we provided our set to the medical rescue service for testing.<br><br>Due to the easy mobile construction, our package is designed for use in war and civil medicine, and is especially convenient for high-risk workplaces or for life far from the medical care.

TARGETING THE MTOR PATHWAY ENHANCES CHEMOSENSITIVITY OF METASTATIC MELANOMA TO PACLITAXEL
Gregory Thomas Kennedy, William Powell Kennedy, 
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that accounts for approximately eighty percent of the deaths from skin cancer. Incidence of melanoma in the American population has steadily increased over recent years. Therefore, it is imperative that an effective treatment be found for this disease. The object of this study was to determine if the chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and rapamycin exhibit synergy in the inhibition of cellular proliferation, promotion of apoptosis, inhibition of in vitro invasion, and down-regulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in the metastatic melanoma cell lines A375 and MeWo. For the cellular proliferation assay, varying concentrations of both drugs were tested alone and in combination. In both cell lines, the combination of drugs exhibited a combinatorial effect statistically significant over the highest single agent with regard to inhibition of cellular proliferation. Lower doses of the drugs exhibited synergy in the both cell lines. In the apoptosis, in vitro invasion, and real time PCR assays, 1 nM concentrations of each drug were used alone and in combination to treat the cells. The combination of drugs induced apoptosis at approximately 12% in both cell lines, while the highest single agent induced apoptosis at around 8%. This difference was statistically significant. In the real time PCR analysis for VEGF down-regulation, the combination did not exhibit greater inhibition of VEGF than the highest single agent. In the in vitro invasion assay, the combination of drugs did not exhibit a statistically significant effect over the highest single agent. This combination of drugs shows promise as a potential treatment for melanoma.

THE SUPERBUG: HOW IT SPREADS
Antonina Alexia Pavlenko, Laura Gudvangen, 
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO

The purpose of the project was to effectviely test the way Staphylococcal bacteria transmits by way of using bacterial transmission models. There were two different models. One model tested the way bacteria transmits through skin to skin contact by using lactobacilli. The other model demonstrated how bacteria transmits by way of fluid exchange. During the skin to skin bacterial transmission trial, 1/2 teaspoon of plain yogurt (which contains lactobacilli) was spread across subject one's hand, they shook hands with subject two, and so on until all twenty subjects had shaken hands. The subjects' hands were then cultured, and the samples were incubated for a 72 hour time period. The results showed that the lactobacilli spread to all twenty subjects, therefore it did not show at which point the bacteria would no longer be transmittable. During the second part of the procedure, which demonstrated the bodily fulid exchange bacterial transmission process, thirty subjects were used. Twenty-nine subjects were given a vial with sodium hydroxide and a pipette. Each subject was to go around and exchange fluids with five other subjects. To see which vials contained "infected" liquid, phenolphthalein was used. The phenolphthalein reacted with sodium hydroxide by turning it pink, therefore each vial which contained pink liquid was classified as "infected." The results showed that exacly one-third of the subjects became infected during the fluid exchange trial. The results of both trials made it evident that when comparing both modles of bacterial transmission, the skin to skin contact more effectively transmitted bacteria than the fluid exchange model.

IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF IMMATURE CARDIAC CELLS TRANSPLANTED INTO MYOCARDIUM
Sarah Maureen Cannon, Jillian Elizabeth McManus, 
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

In previous research concerning heart damage, both pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic heart (EH) cells have been injected into the heart to replace lost cells. However, a side-by-side comparison has never been investigated. The purpose of this experiment is to determine 1) if ES and EH cells can be tracked by means of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) and X-gal markings respectively, 2) which type of cell is more identifiable over the other, and 3) the effectiveness of current injection protocol.<br><br> In this experiment, 5 EH and 5 ES-injected fixed adult mice hearts were sectioned on a cryostat. EH sections were stained for adrenergic transplanted cells. The sections were examined under a microscope; any YFP (ES) or X-gal (EH) cells that were discovered were then counted. <br><br> Transplanted cells have been identified in 2/3 of ES and ¾ of EH hearts. 2 YFP cells were identified in a heart injected with 100,000 ES cells; and 1 YFP cell was identified in a heart injected with one million ES cells. All EH hearts were injected with 17,400 cells. In two of these hearts, one X-gal+ cell was found; in one of the hearts, about 100 cells were found.<br><br> From the data that has been collected thus far, it can be concluded that both types of cells can be located after injections, but embryonic heart cells remain in greater quantities. Additionally, future studies will use more EH cells or cardiac-differentiated ES cells, and test the feasibility of Matrigel co-injection.

METHYLATION IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA RELATIVE TO THE IL-6 PATHWAY
Natalie Deanna Thoni, Farhana Ahmed, 
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Preliminary research on Multiple Myeloma has revealed that tumor suppressor genes are silenced and thus are an important epigentetic event in cancer. IL-6 plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma in that it regulates DNA methylation, resulting in the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. The notion being tested is that IL-6 regulation of hypermethylation is an important pathway that may lead to reaitonal chemotherapeutic/anti IL-6 combinations. The correlation of IL-6 expression and dependence in myeloma cell lines (and to the methylation profile of TSB, DcR1 and CDH1) has been studied. It was concluded that KAS is IL-6 dependent whereas lines U266 and RPMI are IL-6 independent. To study the IL-6 pathway, the cells lines were grown in the presence of anti-IL-6 which functions to block IL-6 proliferation/cell signaling. Blocking IL-6 inhibited U266 by 36%, KAS by 68% , and RPMI only minimally. This lead to the belief that RPMI is not dependent on exogenous IL-6, which was confirmed by RT-PCR by showing that the line didn’t express IL-6. By the same method, U266 was found to express IL-6 and KAS did not. U266 cells are not dependent on exogenous IL-6 but proliferation can be blocked with the anti IL-6 antibody; it was normal not to express IL-6 because of this. KAS is dependent on IL-6 so it wouldn’t be expected to express IL-6. To see if IL-6 sensitivity correlated with hypermethylaion, we investigated the methylation of DcR1 and CDH1. It was shown that CDH1 Is methylated in RPMI and unmethylated in U266. Our current experimentation is about determining the methylation status in KAS and gene expression in all lines for CDH1. Finally, we examined the methylation status of DcR1. RPMI and KAS were unmethylated and U266 was methylated at the DcR1 locus. This supports our hypothesis that an IL-6 dependent pathway may regulate hypermethylation of TSG’s in methylation. Interferon (IFN) has been shown to inhibit the growth of cells by inducing apoptosis. IFN coupled with anti-IL-6 was used to block the growth of Multiple Myeloma cells. Newer chemotherapeutic agents that may affect methylation are also being studied in combination with IL-6 blocking.

PROTECTION OF NEURONS AGAINST INJURY USING NEURORECEPTOR-TARGETING NANOPARTICLES
Jonathan Wang, Jared Goodman, 
Oak Hall School, Gainesville, FL

During traumatic brain injury, neurons are injured or killed by excessive amount of glutamate. Neuroprotectants can be used to rescue the neurons. Yet they are not consistently taken in by only neurons and might be relatively unstable in the circulation. <br><br>In the previous year’s experiment, a device was designed to be used in the targeted delivery of the neuroprotectants to neurons. This device was an immunoliposome, which was an antibody attached to a liposome. The antibody specifically attached to a receptor on the surface of neurons alone, while the liposome was a hollow nanosphere that encapsulated a chemical and released it into the neurons. Fluorescent dyes to show that the contents of the liposomes were successfully delivered to the neurons, proving the success of the targeted delivery device.<br><br>In this year’s experiment, the hypothesis was that if drugs were used instead of fluorescent dyes, then the immunoliposomes could be used to alleviate the harmful effects of glutamate or analogue N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) (excitotoxins) by using targeted delivery to help the drugs reach the neurons.<br><br>The hypothesis was confirmed: cells treated with drug-loaded immunoliposomes showed the least amount of damage. The cells that were treated with the immunoliposomes had less breakdown of an essential protein in the cytoskeleton (alphaII-spectrin), while the cells that had not been treated with the liposomes had a much greater amount of breakdown of this protein. The results indicate that the neuron-targeting immunoliposomes are an effective method of alleviating the neuronal cell injury caused by excitotoxin.

INVESTIGATION OF HEMATOGENOUS PLACENTAL TRANSMISSION OF ORAL BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH PRETERM BIRTH USING A PREGNANT MURINE MODEL
Jennifer Paige Ginsberg, Rochelle Dumm, 
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

This project studies oral bacteria colonization in placenta that could result in intra-amniotic infection, inflammation and eventually preterm birth (PTB). The 16S rRNA gene of different salivary bacteria from placental samples from impregnated mice was analyzed in order to examine the relationship between oral bacteria and PTB. The mice were never touched by us, but by others in the lab who provided the samples. <br><br> Culturing method used DNA extracted from cultivated bacteria to amplify 16S rRNA gene by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Culture-independent method used DNA extracted directly from the saliva and the placentas to identify cultivatable bacteria. In the latter method, 16S rRNA gene was amplified and a plasmid DNA extraction was performed. All DNA was sequenced, aligned, and analyzed using online database BLAST from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).<br><br> In culturing method, Streptococcus spp. were the most prevalent salivary species identified, which included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus genomosp. Also identified were Veillonella atypica and Veillonella sp. and Actinomyces sp. This study indicates that the intrauterine infection of Veillonella may originate from the oral cavity. In the culture-independent method, the species most prevalent was Neisseria sp., a coccal Gram-negative bacterium often associated with causing bacterial meningitis and infections that lead to full-body inflammation. <br><br> This study indicates many species believed to infect the uterus from the vaginal tract may originate from the oral cavity. The study provides evidence for the role of oral bacteria in PTB and asserts that maintaining oral health may help reduce PTB. <br><br>

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN PROTECTING NEURONS FROM AMYLOID BETA PEPTIDE: A POSSIBLE TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Rachel Madeline Eaton, Samira Nedungadi, 
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

In this project, we determined the effectiveness of antioxidants in protecting cells from oxidative stress due to soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide, which is the primary source of cell death in Alzheimer’s disease. Research has shown that certain antioxidants may be able to prevent oxidation and thereby help treat Alzheimer’s. In our experiment, we grew mouse neuronal cultures, pretreated them with various antioxidants (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and resveratrol), and exposed them to Aβ-peptide. A cell count performed after peptide exposure determined the percentage of living cells; this percentage was then compared to percentages of living cells in the untreated cultures. Overall, we found that resveratrol was the most effective preventative treatment for cells, with an average of 83% still alive after the Aβ-peptide was added. A combination of Vitamins C & E, however, caused the least amount of cell death, 0.069%, when a non-toxic peptide was used to determine any adverse effects of the antioxidants themselves. Our findings about these antioxidants support the conclusions of similar studies, though as of yet no studies have shown if antioxidants will work effectively in human patients, since the blood-brain barrier will filter out any antioxidants a person consumes.

IN VIVO EXPRESSION OF GENETIC MUTATION INDUCED BY INHALATION OF CIGARETTE SMOKE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Jada Dalley, Sehar Salman, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Scientists have studied the effects of smoking on health and discovered what is now considered common knowledge; smoking is harmful. The purpose of this study was to develop a new technique, involving the properties of the chemical X-gal and of the Lac operon, to detect genetic mutations induced by second-hand smoke. The new method would determine if the offspring, of the flies, are mutated in the pupal stage. It was hypothesized that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to second-hand smoke would produce live, white larvae, and that the mutations in the white larvae would become phenotypically apparent in the adult stage. A preliminary experiment was used to determine which concentration of X-gal would be best for the expression of blue color (the presence or absence of which indicates normalcy or mutation). The second phase of the study involved the actual exposure to second-hand smoke. Flies were exposed to cigarette smoke within a closed fixed volume container. Three groups of flies were exposed twice, for times of 10, 20, and 30 minutes respectively. After 5 days, the fly pupae were inspected for blue coloration.<br><br> Approximately 55% of the control flies were blue, and nearly 66% of the exposed flies were white. Blue pupae grew into normal adults. White pupae grew into mutated flies. Thus, the hypothesis was confirmed. In conclusion, results showed that the X-gal technique indicated the presence or absence of mutation induced by second-hand smoke by the observation of the blue or white pupae.

BIOSIMULATION OF AVIAN INFLUENZA: FROM ENDEMIC TO PANDEMIC
Alexander Chernyakhovsky, Tong Zhan, 
William Mason High School, Mason, OH

Forecasting epicenters and timelines of avian influenza outbreaks is vital to effectively combat this disease and prevent a pandemic. Accordingly, we have developed a simulation-based prediction methodology to analyze the spread of H5N1 using stochastic interactions between waterfowl, poultry, and humans. The biosimulation is based on a unique mathematical model that uses Markov processes and spherical geometry to characterize the salient epidemiological aspects of the disease. We have developed and incorporated our mathematical model into a user-friendly, extensible software environment called SEARUMS. SEARUMS enables rapid prediction of epicenters and timelines of H5N1 outbreaks using existing statistical data. Here we present the mathematical model, its implementation in SEARUMS using the Engineering Method, verification and validation of our methodology, and its application in four case studies. The case studies, conducted using the Scientific Method, discussed in this presentation are: 1) analyzing factors influencing spread of H5N1 to USA; 2) How do different transmission pathways affect the mutations of H5N1; 3) assessing pandemic threat to US population; 4) predicting impacts to US economy. The experiments and case studies illustrate that the proposed methodology has considerable potential to empower researchers, national organizations, and medical response teams with timely knowledge to avert a pandemic.

ANTIBODY BASED BIOSENSOR FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUSES
Kaley Kristen White, Marc Drayton Ganz, 
Edmond North High School, Edmond, OK

Preliminary research into the eventual development of a facile method for the identification and differentiation of closely related strains of viruses in humans and animals is presented. For this study, the goal was to determine if an immobilized antibody based biosensor could easily individually identify between two closely related viruses so that this method may someday be used to identify a viral infection such as West Nile Virus and Bird Flu. <br><br>The viruses chosen for this experiment were Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease virus (EHDV) which are closely related serogroups of orbiviruses. The biosensor surface consisted of antibodies for either BTV and EHDV isolated by the USDA Arthropod Borne Disease Laboratory, that were immobilized into a metalized surface by a tether layer, DSP. The method for detecting the antibody-virus interaction used was Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. The test we used consisted of using multiple Spreetas with either the BTV antibody or the EHDV antibody and testing them against their mismatched pair and then testing them with their actual antigen.<br><br>Results indicated that biosensor surfaces easily identified the target virus, but were unresponsive to the non-target virus. The total time of analysis was eight minutes, with positive identification capable at four minutes.

ENGINEERED SURFACES FOR CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND BIOMINERALIZATION AND SELF ASSEMBLY OF FIBRINOGEN CLOTS
Alexander Shlomo Ramek, Adam Fields, 
Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaways, Cedarhurst, NY

We demonstrated that we could induce dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to differentiate into osteoblasts, which biomineralize, simply by altering the mechanical properties of their environment without the use of chemical induction. Shear modulation force microscopy, indicated that the relative moduli of DPSCs over a four week period increased continuously when cultured on hard polybutadiene thin films (200 Å), suggesting that the cells were sensing te mechanics of their environment, leading to successful biomineralization after the third week. SEM, EDAX and glancing incidnece x-ray diffraction indicated that the cells were producing micro sized particles of hydroxyapatite in the third week. Surface interactions were also used to control self organization of fibrinogen. Normally, fibrin fiberils can only form when thrombin is added to cleave the fibrinogen n-terminals, exposing of the aC domains. On hydrophobic surfaces we show that the aC domains are aligned in a registry which permits further orientation and organization into fibrils, with or without thrombin, while this clotting is inhibited on hydrophilic surfaces. The role of these domains was demonstrated by comparing fractions of fibrinogen isolated from human plasma with two, one, and no aC domains. This study provides three types of innovative engineered surfaces. One to induce bone formation and stem cel differentiation, one to promote enhanced wound healing by initiating clotting, and one to prevent undesired harmful clotting on surfaces.

THE ROLE OF EDEMA IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF SPINAL CORD INJURY
Neelu Thomas Pathiyil, Ashwin Ricci, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Loss of locomotor function after spinal cord injury is thought to be contributed by edema. Tempol is a neuroprotective antioxidant agent that improves locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Pro-oxidant buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) inhibits tempol. Scoliosis can be induced by SCI. It is yet to be determined if tempol improves locomotor function by reducing edema and if tempol reduces scoliosis induced by SCI. In this image study, microscopy images were used to determine if tempol reduces edema, represented by cross-sectional area, after spinal cord injury. It was determined that edema was not reduced by tempol (p>.05), and edema was reduced with BSO (p<.05). In the radiogram analysis, in which lateral deviations were digitally measured, of rats afflicted with scoliosis, tempol and BSO each significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the maximum vertebral deviation. Our results suggest that edema is not indicative of poor recovery within SCI and that tempol and BSO may work differently with scoliosis and SCI. Since both nitroxides are involved in a series of redox reactions, it is even possible that tempol acts as a pro-oxidant in certain areas and as an antioxidant in others whereas BSO is acting in the reverse manner.

WHAT A SHOCKER! A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF AN ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN HUMANS
Ryan William Tibble, Charles William Coop, 
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

The project in its current form is the result of the experimentation of the effects of an electrostatic charge placed throughout the body. We hope to find that sending electricity for three minutes through the body would consistently lower blood glucose levels based on previous experiments performed on lab mice. <br><br> Blood glucose levels were obtained through means of using a MediSense Precision Xtra blood glucose meter and its accompanying lancet pen. The course of the experiment covered three days of testing for each subject. Day one involved only two blood glucose readings as to ensure no major irregularities. Days two and three involved the subject’s exposure to the Van de Graaff generator for three minutes. The subject’s blood glucose levels were taken before exposure, as well as ten and forty minutes after the subject’s exposure to the charge to observe the effects the electrostatic charge had on blood glucose levels.<br><br> The results varied from subject to subject, decreasing by 28 mg/dL for one while increasing by 29 mg/dL for another. This erratic difference between each subject only leads to more questions. Thus, a conclusion cannot be drawn form the data other than the Van de Graaff does create an effect. More experimentation will be needed to examine the effects it has on different people. <br><br> The potential contributions of this project are immense. It has created the first step into the world of “electromedics” and has created an outline toward future experimentation involving the use of an electrostatic charge.

BE FRUIT FLY AND MULTIPLY: A BLIND STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF RED WINE AND GREEN TEA ON THE LIFE SPAN AND OFFSPRING OF DROSOPHILA
Theodore Jay Garber, Andrew Rubinett, Justin Fu
Shepton High School, Plano, TX

There are claims that red wine and green tea provide health benefits to humans. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of red wine and green tea on the life span and offspring of the fruit fly. The fly is an ideal organism used to simulate humans due to the similarity between the gene families of flies and humans. It was hypothesized that if fruit flies were exposed to two different amounts of red wine and green tea, then the flies given wine will have the longest life span and the greatest number of offspring followed by the flies given the green tea and then the flies with nothing added. <br><br>240 flies were divided into the following groups: two conditions of red wine (.1mL and .2mL) added to fly flood, two conditions of green tea (.1mL and .2mL) added to fly food, and the control with nothing added. Each tube of flies was labeled with shapes to create a blind, objective study.<br><br>The hypothesis was partially proven. The wine flies had the most offspring with 36% more than the control, which was predicted, but had the shortest life span. The tea flies lived the longest in both generations and had the fewest offspring. An inverse relationship appears between longer life spans and more offspring. Applications could include promoting tea’s potential medicinal effects on humans in delaying death. Further studies could determine the appropriate amount of red wine needed to maximize human health benefits and possibly improve fertility.

POTENTIAL CANCER CURING COMPOUNDS
Deepika Bhargo, Linda Chau, 
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which compound, Hydroxyurea, Folinic Acid or Southern Copperhead Snake venom, was the most effective in preventing Colon and Prostate cancer, so that adults over the age of 50 can receive better treatment because these types cancer are extremely common and curable. The effectiveness of each compound was determined by measuring the percent growth of cancer cells as a function of compound concentration over a three day period. <br><br> Based on research, it was hypothesized that the snake venom would work the best to prevent the growth of both cancers, and that Folinic Acid would work the second best. Hydroxyurea will be the least effective of all the reagents. <br><br> A brief overview of the procedure is as follows. First obtain enough cancer cells to grow in a flask. Transfer the cells to a 96-well plate. Add the media with the cancer cells, and the appropriate concentrations of the reagents into each well. Place them into the CO2 incubator for one day. Add in the MTT Assay; four hours later, add in Acidic Isopropanol or SDS/HCL. Later put the plate in the Spectrophotometer and read the plate at the wavelength of 570 nanometers. The results will be read in optical density. <br><br> Results indicate that for both cell lines, the 7.5 millimolar concentration of Folinic Acid and the snake venom were most effective. In general, the Hydroxyurea was consistently less effective in both cell lines.

OPTIMIZED CELL MIGRATION ACROSS FUNCTIONALIZED SURFACES
Dhruv Nandamudi, Daniel Stemp, 
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Objective/Goal<br><br>Examining the major steps constituting wound healing, we noted that the migration of dermal fibroblasts into the inflicted site was the essential step in new tissue formation. Through our research, we studied the parameters involved in the process of cell migration in order to design a hydrogel surface that would facilitate optimum migration speeds. We examined the need for optimal levels of cell-substrate adhesiveness, based on bonding sites between the cell’s receptor proteins and those of the substrate as well as substrate stiffness to engineer a workable hydrogel for enhanced wound healing and to increase understanding of the cell migration process itself. <br><br>Materials/Method<br><br>We tested the effects of cell-substratum adhesivenees and substrate stiffness on cell migration by varying the amounts of Fibronectin (FN-1), the primary ligand involved in fibroblast adhesions, and Gelatin (GTN) and Transglutaminase (TG), components of our skin-tissue-compatible hydrogel, respectively. <br><br>Results/Conclusion<br><br>We successfully examined cell migration across substrates with different levels of adhesiveness and different levels of stiffness, and we examined the reasoning behind it. We observed that the fibroblasts migrated fastest on the intermediate amount of adhesiveness when the Petri dish was coated with Fibronectin. This was due to the vinculin/adhesion polarization in the cell, which we quantified using Confocal microscopy and ImageJ software. When the fibroblasts were seeded on hydrogels composed of GTN and TG with varied levels of substrate stiffness, we observed that the cells migrated fastest on the substrate of intermediate stiffness. The hydrogels with varied levels of stiffness were then coated with 30 µg/ml of Fibronectin, and we observed that once again, the fibroblasts migrated the fastest on the substrate with the intermediate stiffness. Lastly, we varied the amount of Fibronectin on the optimal stiffness level, and engineered a gel with both optimal stiffness and adhesiveness.

INDUCING MYOGENESIS: A NOVEL CELLULAR SYSTEM FOR MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY
Zuha Qazi, Julia Goldberg, 
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, NY

Myotonic Dystrophy (DM) presently affects approximately one out of every eight thousand people worldwide. DM is characterized by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of teh Dysttrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene, located on chromosome 19. The disease mainly debilitates muscle function and muscle generation by affecting the development of myoblasts, or myogenic precursor cells.<br><br> The myoblasts of a person afflicted with DM are inhibited from differentiating into myotubes, which are basic muscle cells. It is presumed that this inhibition is caused by the retention of mutant RNA in the nucleus of the affected myoblasts and the inhibition of differentiation-specific genes. Our group has discovered that the Woodchuck Post-transcriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) is in fact capable of exporting the mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, thereby allowing translation to occur. This transportation was shown to repair the differentiation of the muscle cells. The purpose of our investigation is to better understand the mechanisms by which WPRE restores differentiation and muscular function. Through our studies we have discovered that levels of MyoD and Myogenin, important myogenic regulatory factors, increased significantly via the effects of WPRE, which also improved the levels of otehr proteins implicated in the differentiation pathway. This is an important cellular model for the identification of the molecular pathology of DM and to form a platform for its therapy.

PREVALENCE OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS IN TWO POPULATIONS
Jocelyn Aubrey Wu, Serena Au, 
Bellarmine Preparatory School, Tacoma, WA

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a strain of S. aureus bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics that commonly resides in the external nares. Although nosocomial in origin, the presence of MRSA is evident in the outside community. The objective of this study was to examine and compare the prevalence rates of MRSA in anonymous community populations of hospital and high school employees. Samples were taken from the external nares of community workers of both populations by a licensed professional using BBL Single Swabs, directly inoculated onto BBL CHROMagar MRSA plates, incubated for 72 hours, and verified using a latex coagulation reagent. Nine out of 80 employees (11.5%) tested in the high school and 10 out of 78 employees (12.5%) tested in the hospital were found to have MRSA colonization. The high school and the hospital community populations yielded evident rates of prevalence within each population. A T-test indicated 43% chance that the same discrepancy of 1% would be found if the study were repeated. The results revealed the indiscriminate nature of infection and imply that CA-MRSA is possibly approaching a point of equal prevalence in the community as in the hospital.

ANALYSIS OF SERUM ASSAYS TO DETECT IGE AGAINST FUNGI AND DUST MITES IN INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO PIGEON DROPPINGS (COLUMBA LIVIA), PHASE V
Legna Marie Figueroa-Cosme, Darlenne Marie Torres-Cordero, 
Superior Urbana, Patillas, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research was to make blood tests to detect Immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) against fungi and dust mites in individuals exposed to pigeon droppings (Columba livia). The hypothesis was: individuals exposed to pigeon droppings will undergo a critical time period, in which their immune system will be challenged and afterwards will produce IgE antibodies. <br><br>Blood tests were performed to three(3) teachers, two(2) students and one(1) bird collector. Those tests evidenced sensitization to the following fungi: (4/6)67% to Epidermophyton, (3/6)50% to Candida, (2/6)33% to Trichophyton and Cladosporium, (1/6)17% to Aspergillus, and Penicillium. There was also sensitization to some dust mites: (4/6)67% to Dermatophagoides pteromyssinus and (3/6)50% to Dermatophagoides faringe. The bird collector was the only one who developed IgE antibodies to Penicillium and Aspergilius which are present in pigeon’s droppings.<br><br> In addition, questionnaires were administrated to 62 pigeon collectors who were attending a national convention. The (57/62)92% of the collectors questioned considered that their health had not been affected because of the pigeon’s excrement. However, (17/62)27% of them indicated that they had a respiratory condition: 41% had nasal allergies and frequent cough, 35% had nasal discomfort and respiratory difficulties, 24% had sinusitis. Ninety four per cent (58/62) 94% had never been tested for sensitization to fungi and mites.<br><br> Previous investigations evidenced that pigeon droppings possess specific allergens, which produce respiratory diseases. The serum assays evidenced that the persons exposed to pigeon droppings are producing IgE antibodies against these specific allergens found in pigeon’s excrement.

PLANARIAN REGENERATION
Jessamyn Sharon Moore, Hannah Stewart, 
Northview High School, Brazil, IN

The purpose was to discover if the location of a section of planarians, in comparison to the eyespots, has an effect on the planarians’ light sensitivity and to observe the effect of water pH and temperature on planarian regeneration. The hypothesis was the farther away from the eyespots a section of planarian is, the less sensitive to light it will be and the planarians will regenerate best with a pH of 6 and at room temperature.<br><br> We timed how long it took planarians to choose between light and dark. We repeated this with planarians that were cut into fourths. We made dishes with pHs of 5, 6, and 7, and one at room temperature, one warmer, and one cooler. We put measured halves in the containers and allowed them to regenerate. At the end of two weeks, the surviving planarians sizes were recorded.<br><br> The end of our project produced interesting data. The first and fourth sections were most light sensitive and quickest responding (p<.5). The second and third sections were not as quick or didn’t respond (p<0). Instead of the sections closest to the eyespots being most responsive, the ends of the planarians were. There was a difference in growth between the pH of 5 and 6 planarians (p<.1) and the pH 5 and 7 (p<.2). The room temperature was different from the cooler (p<0). None of the others had significant differences (p<0). The pH 6 was best, as hypothesized, but temperatures did not have any effect.

EFFECTS OF CHINESE HERBS ON THE METABOLISM OF CHOLESTEROL AND GLUCOSE
Norman Nuo Zeng, Maggie Zhang, 
Ann Arbor-Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

Dry angelica root (DG), lotus embryos (LE) and lycicum (GQ) are the most common herbs used to treat diseases in Chinese Medicine. In our study from last year, we found that these Chinese herbs may act to reduce the level of cholesterol in vitro. Here we examined their effects on the metabolism of cholesterol and glucose in mice. Sixteen mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed with regular water (control) or one of the following herb extracts: DG, LE and GQ for twelve days. Mouse with hypercholesterolemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cholesterol at a dose of 6 mg/25g body weight. Following administration of cholesterol, mice fed with GQ, DG, or LE showed a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol relative to the control, indicating an improvement in the metabolism of cholesterol (P<0.05, ANOVA). In parallel to this change, mice fed with GQ or LE showed a significant increase in glucose tolerance (P<0.05, ANOVA), while DG demonstrated an insignificant effect. Our study demonstrates that Chinese herbs DG, LE and GQ may stimulate the metabolism of the cholesterol and glucose and therefore be beneficial for patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.

THE EFFECTS OF ELECTROLYTES ON PULSE RATES
Christine Alice Schexnayder, Brianna Bourgeoius, 
Lutcher High School, Lutcher, LA

The purpose of this project was to determine weather or not gatorade or powerade can maintain a lower pulse rate during exercise than water. During exercise, athletes lose electrolytes through their sweat. We wanted to see if the athlete's pulse rates would be affected by the electrolytes in these sports drinks.<br><br> After getting permission from the subject's parents, we had each subject drink eight ounces of water and wait twenty minutes for their body to process it. After twenty minutes we took their resting pulse rate and began to jog. After eight minutes, we took their pulse rates again. The next day, we repeated the steps using gatorade and the following day we did the same with powerade.<br><br> After our experiment we found that the drink that had the lowest percent change for boys (88.9) and girls (97.3) was Gatorade. The highest percent change for both the boys (106.1) and girls (107.7) was Powerade.

EVEN DAPHNIS NEED THEIR DAILY CUP: THE EFFECTS OF STIMULANTS ON THE HEART
Noelle Rani Owen, Diana Cabral, 
Saint Andrew's Priory, Honolulu, HI

The purpose of our experiment was to find which stimulant (caffeine, cayenne pepper, ginseng, guarana, or taurine) would affect the heart rate of daphnia magna the most. Our hypothesis was that guarana would raise heart rate the most because after doing expansive research, we found out that guarana is a very strong stimulant and that it has three times more caffeine than coffee has. <br><br> After we made our hypothesis, experimentation begun. First, we made a solution of each stimulant and water. We then gave a certain solution to the daphnia and then after a certain amount of time measured their heart rate in beats per minute under a microscope. <br><br> Finally after many weeks of experimentation, we got data. After analyzing the data, we saw that guarana rose heart rate the most at 52 beats per minute at a low concentration of the stimulant, and 101 beats per minute at a high concentration. Our hypothesis was correct. Guarana did indeed raise heart rate the most. In conclusion, guarana affected daphnia magna heart rate the most out of all the stimulants that were tested. Our experiment was very successful and we wish to further our experiment in the future.

THE EFFECT OF CAFFEINE ON DUGESIA TIGRINA REGENERATION RATE 
Kelsey Alyse Fogal, Gaukhar Gabdullina, 
Chippewa Hills High School, Remus, MI

The regeneration of the Planaria Dugesia tigrina has been explored for over 100 years due to the ability to grow new tissue at the wound site(Reddien and Alvarado, 2004). In this study the effects of incremental doses of caffeine on regeneration rates in Dugesia tigrina were examined. The tails of 40 Dugesia tigrina were amputated, and the planaria were assigned to one of four groups: low-dose caffeine (L,0.005 mg), medium-dose caffeine (M, 0.001 mg), high-dose caffeine (H,0.01 mg) or a control group (C, tap water only). Various factors of the Planaria (length, movement, deformities, regeneration rate and survival rate) were measured after the amputation. On Days 6, 9 and 12 the mean regeneration rates of the control group (C), low-dose group(L) and medium-dose group (M) were significantly higher than that of the high-dose group (H). In addition, there was a significantly lower survival rate with the high-dose group. These results suggest that caffeine at high doses can impact regeneration rates and even result in death.<br><br>

OVERCOMING BIOFILM FORMATION CAUSED BY CANDIDA: A POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ORAL THRUSH AND DENTAL CARIES
Stephanie Y Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

Dental caries is one of the most common health problems worldwide. It is a transmissible disease, ordinarily caused by cariogenic bacteria but also caused by various Candida species. Oral thrush is another common oral Candidiasis. It is associated with immunocompromised status such as AIDS patients or cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 5% oral thrush infections are resistant to fluconazole. Finding an effective way to prevent or treat oral thrush is important. Both diseases require biofilm formation as initial step of their pathogenesis.<br><br><br> In this experiment, five substances (oregano oil, table salt, baking soda, Listerine mouthwash (38% alcohol), and toothpaste) were studied against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis.<br><br> <br><br> Oregano oil showed the strongest inhibition against all the Candida species tested. In contrast, saturated NaCl solution did not show any inhibition. Toothpaste showed some inhibition against the three tested Candida species, but only 1/3 the magnitude of inhibition by oregano oil. Saturated NaHCO3 solution inhibited C. krusei up to 1/2 the magnitude of oregano oil. Listerine mouthwash showed very modest activity against C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The differences between inhibition were statistically significant (p < 0.0001) with the three Candida species. The growth inhibition was also demonstrated by the time-course analysis. <br><br><br> Oregano oil also showed ability of eradicating thickly grown fungal biofilm from all three Candida species tested after 12 hours of incubation.<br><br> In conclusion, oregano oil is a potentially effective treatment for oral thrush. Its ability of eradicating fungal biofilm helps prevent oral thrush and dental caries.

EXTRACTION OF PHENOLICS IN HONEY FOR ANTIBACTERIAL ANALYSIS: PHASE III
Bora Kang
Union Grove High School, McDonough, GA

Part one and two of the honey project rendered honey as an effective antibiotic agent. Numerous samples of honey were tested on bacteria, and it was found that honey’s inhibitory effect against bacteria exhibited a positive correlation between the amount of glucose oxidase in honey, an enzyme known to produce hydrogen peroxide. However, the glucose oxidase hypothesis was flawed in that hydrogen peroxide was not only sensitive to light and heat, but was also susceptible to body fluids and tissue catalyses. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the non-peroxide activity of honey. It was hypothesized that honey contained inhibines other than hydrogen peroxide such as phenolic compounds capable of antimicrobial activity without the presence of glucose oxidase. To test the hypothesis, two honeys, Manuka and Forest, were diluted with deionized water, subjected to base hydrolysis and extracted with ethyl acetate for the liquid-liquid extraction. After recovering the phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity was determined via broth dilution assay, where different concentrations of phenolic solutions were added to the bacteria of the 96-well plates and incubated. The plates were examined for turbidity indicating growth of the bacteria, and the minimum concentration of the phenolics that inhibited the bacteria (MIC) was determined. The phenolics displayed antimicrobial activity against the bacteria, although of lesser significance than those of hydrogen peroxide. Nevertheless, the contribution of antimicrobial properties of non-peroxide antibacterial activity confirms that glucose oxidase is not the only inhibine in honey, and shows how honey’s broad array of antibacterial activity can be used for alternative treatments for infections.

THE DOWN-REGULATION OF SP1 PROTEIN BY TOLFENAMIC ACID IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER
Shannon Somer Stockton
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to test the effectiveness of Tolfenamic acid in down-regulating Sp proteins and thus inhibiting head and neck cancer growth. The researcher hypothesized that if significant levels of Sp1 protein were detected in cancer cells, then the cells would be susceptible to treatment by Tolfenamic acid. Additionally, higher amounts of Tolfenamic acid should decrease cell proliferation more than lower amounts, and after treatment, cells should contain little or no Sp1 protein.<br><br> To test these hypotheses, an experiment involving the head and neck cancer cell line UMSCC-1 was designed. First, the cell line was maintained through cell culture until the experiment began. A Western was then used to check for Sp1's presence. Then, a cell titer glo assay was used to analyze the control group, 25 micromolar, 50 micromolar, 75 micromolar, and 100 micromolar amounts of Tolfenamic acid. Afterwards, a second Western was used to check for the presence of Sp1 protein after Tolfenamic acid treatment. <br><br> The data collected from the first Western proved that Sp1 protein is present in UMSCC-1. In the cell titer glo assay, the 100 micromolar amount decreased cell proliferation the most. The second Western proved that Sp1 protein was significantly less prevalent after Tolfenamic acid treatment. All hypotheses were accepted.

STEALTHY IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES: TOWARDS THE IDENTIFICATION AND ERADICATION OF CANCER CELLS
Philip S Schlenoff
Maclay School, Tallahassee, FL

Nanoparticles are one of the most promising tools in the area of biotechnical and oncological research. As an effective method for targeted drug delivery and cell identification, magnetic nanoparticles are a prime choice for cancer treatment and therapy. When coated with the recently developed zwitterion 3-(dimethyl(3-(trimethoxysil)propyl)ammonio)propane-1-sulfonate, or SBS, nanoparticles can freely flow through the bloodstream and be tracked using Magnetic Resonance Imaginging (MRI). Their ability to be affected by Radio Frequency (RF) irradiation allows them to safely release their payload or be destroyed once they’ve been absorbed by their intended target.<br><br>The nanoparticles I’m using for my project have an iron oxide core, coated with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), which reduces toxicity. Covering the TEOS is the zwitterion SBS, which masks them from cells and acts as a non-aggregator and surface neutralizer. These have the potential to be coated in cancer-seeking antibodies, which would let only cancer cells absorb them. <br><br>At this point in the project, the nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized and fed to the HeLa cells. After two hours of incubation, the HeLa cells were subjected to Radio Frequency irradiation (4 Amps, 357 kHz) and then stained with trypan blue to test for cell viability. After one hour of RF treatment, all the HeLa cells were still viable; however, further testing is needed with a more powerful RF generator (recommended strength is 260 Amps).

THE STONES AT WAR: A STUDY OF THE ENHANCEMENT OF LITHOTRIPSY
Prateek Bhuvan Sharma
Clark High School, Plano, TX

The purpose was to experiment the use of multiple lithotripters to enhance the efficiency of lithotripsy, as well as the safety of internal organs. Initially, a set of equations based on the correlation of force and angle degree, were used to measure the impact of sound waves on kidney stones from various numbers of lithotripters and angles. The results showed that three lithotripters fixed at 355 degrees, 85 degrees, and 330 degrees provide a greater force on the stone than the previously conceived idea of a single concentration of 1 sound wave at 0 degrees. Using the optimal angles, a Lithotripsy simulation was completed. The experiment was carried out by placing model kidneys with test stones on top of a lithotripter at the specified angles. The results showed a 94.52% increase in efficiency from the use of 1 lithotripter to 3 lithotripters. These results validated the hypothesis, as three lithotripters placed at the aforementioned angles, provided a greater impact than just one lithotripter. Before the experiment for this project was conducted, the previously conceived notion of lithotripsy was that a single, concentrated shockwave of sound energy supplied the most effective method of lithotripsy. But the results of this experiment have proven the past theory wrong, as not only do three lithotripters provide a sufficiently greater impact on kidney stones, but the protection of internal organs becomes easier to control. With the increased efficiency of lithotripsy and protection of internal organs, the risk of severe urological diseases is significantly reduced.

MRI T2 MAPPING OF KNEE ARTICULAR CARTILAGE IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS
Ana Celeste Colon
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease in the United States as well as worldwide. The objective of this experiment was to assess the articular cartilage of the knee in asymptomatic patients by using MRI T2 mapping to identify early cartilage degeneration as a sign of early osteoarthritis. It was hypothesized that increased T2 values would be detected, because of the presence of cartilage degeneration. The knees of asymptomatic patients were scanned in a GE Signa 1.5T system and T2 mapping software was used to analyze the articular cartilage of the femur, tibia and patella. Data concerning the presence or absence of cartilage degeneration was recorded along with T2 values of the tissue. <br><br> A total of 50 knees were scanned and qualitative and quantitative measurements were obtained. The responding variable was represented by the T2 values of the articular cartilage. Data obtained indicate that cartilage degeneration was present, despite the absence of symptoms. The femoral articular cartilage was the most frequently affected while the tibial cartilage was affected the least, in both men and women. Abnormal cartilage was detected more often with advancing age. Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the T2 values of normal and abnormal cartilage.<br><br> Patients might benefit, through prevention and/or treatment, from the identification of early cartilage degeneration. Additional research is still necessary since early cartilage degeneration detected by MRI might not necessarily evolve into clinically apparent osteoarthritis. Follow-up studies of these patients to determine if symptoms of osteoarthritis develop could be performed.

THERMAL ABLATION OF GLIOBLASTOMA TUMOR STEM CELLS USING GOLD NANORODS
Muna Oli
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

Most brain tumors diagnosed are glioblastomas: an aggressive form of cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy is often used for treatment but doesn’t guarantee full removal of tumor tissue and harms surrounding healthy tissue. A novel approach to removing glioblastomas, especially deep in the brain, is thermal ablation of the tumor cells by injecting gold nanorods into the tumor area and heating it at low temperatures using harmless infrared lasers. Preliminary data shows that this causes nanorods to “explode”, killing tumor cells with much less damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The hypothesis is that ablation of tumors with gold nanorods using heath will reduce tumor size and destroy the latent tumor cells. Experimentation was split into stages: synthesis of gold nanorods and PEGylated to facilitate entry into cells. A primary glioblastoma brain tumor cell line was used (neurospheres), growing in tissue culture: cells were dosed with nanorods and treated with laser. Effects examined using confocal/electron microscopy, flow cytometry and other cytotoxicity assays. It was found that the cells readily took up nanorods. When the cells with nanorods were exposed to laser, there was an affect seen, showing the method works on in vitro systems and has potential clinical applications.

WHY YOUR ARTERIES CARE ABOUT PAPP-A: PAPP-A ENHANCES SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL HYPERPLASIA
Catherine Elizabeth Ishitani
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in developed countries. Atherosclerotic plaque develops in response to vascular injury, when factors such as Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A(PAPP-A) promote smooth muscle cell(SMC) migration and hyperplasia leading to subendothelial fibrous plaque formation. PAPP-A is a metalloproteinase that regulates vascular injury response. Importantly, it degrades inhibitory insulin-like growth factor(IGF) binding protein-4, thereby increasing local IGF-I bioactivity, which stimulates SMC differentiation and hyperplasia in injury response. <br><br>This study investigated the role of PAPP-A in vascular injury response in vivo. Transgenic mice(Tg) expressing human PAPP-A in arterial SMC and wild-type mice(WT) were used to test the hypothesis that overexpression of PAPP-A enhances SMC hyperplasia and exacerbates injury response. Mice underwent unilateral carotid artery ligation performed by qualified scientist, and were harvested 5, 10, and 15 days post-operatively. <br><br>Arteries were perfused, sectioned at three distances, stained, photographed, and measured. PAPP-A mRNA expression was determined through qRT-PCR; endogenous expression was elevated (Days 10, 15) in WT and Tg (which overexpressed PAPP-A). <br><br>Interestingly, Tg exhibited delayed neointimal formation versus WT, with areas 18.5% (D5) and 44.4% (D10) less, but increasing 4.7-fold to 128% (D15) greater. Similarly, Tg exhibited delayed medial proliferation, increasing from 40.1% (D5) less area to 12.6% (D15) greater. Data also indicated that SMC migration was delayed in Tg. In external and internal(contralateral) controls, medial area did not change and neointima did not form. <br><br>This study found that PAPP-A overexpression exacerbated and delayed injury response in vivo and provides evidence of PAPP-A’s importance as a vascular injury response regulator.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE THE BACTERIAL NUMBER AND THUS THE PROGRESSION OF PROPRIONIBACTERIUM ACNES WITH A NATURAL THERAPY?
Taylor Elizabeth Welu
Marshall Senior High School, Marshall, MN

As a teenager, I have been struggling with acne, as have other kids my age. There are thousands of people around the globe endlessly spending money on countless acne products that never seem to work. I being one of them. Which got me thinking, is there a natural, cost efficient, and chemically safe treatment for acne?<br><br> The first step in my procedure was to find a sample of my bacteria. The bacteria I want to work with, called proprionibacterium acnes, is found on most people's skin; and live on fatty acids in the sebaceous glands. Simplified, proprionibacterium acnes is found in pimples. I swabbed a few pimples from my face and brought the samples to a research lab to try and isolate and grow the bacteria out. After isolating the bacteria, I used it to create an immunogen to inject into ten chickens. A week after the injection, I collected the eggs from them. By injecting the chickens with the immunogen, they create antibodies specific to fight my bacteria. They then put these antibodies into their eggs, which is what I use for my tests. I ran two ELISA tests on the bacteria, and when I did these tests, I was testing to see if the antibodies from the eggs would bind with the bacteria. <br><br> In conclusion, I was able to run a variety of tests to prove that the bacteria, proprionibacterium acnes, successfully bound to antibodies found in the eggs of the chickens I injected. By running two ELISA tests, I was able to prove my hypothesis correct.

CATHETER-ASSOCIATED ENTEROCOCCAL BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS: DOES SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT IMPLY THE REMOVAL OF THE CATHETER?
Marilyn Lee Piccirillo
Parkway West High School, Ballwin, MO

Background: It is unclear whether catheter removal is a necessary component of successful management of catheter-associated enterococcal bloodstream infections.<br><br>Hypothesis: Removal of the catheter is necessary for successful management of catheter-associated enterococcal bloodstream infections.<br><br>Methods: Records of patients diagnosed with enterococcal catheter-associated bacteremia were retrospectively reviewed. Information on comorbidities, antibiotic treatment, catheter management, infection response, and patient outcome was obtained. A catheter was considered retained if it was present for greater than or equal to 96 hours after detection of bacteremia. <br><br>Results: The records of 65 patients with enterococcal catheter-associated bacteremia were reviewed. In 28 (43%) patients the catheter was retained for greater than or equal to 96 hours, and in 37 (57%) the catheter was removed in less than 96 hours. Patients with retained catheters had a higher rate of recurrent bacteremia when compared to patients whose catheters were removed [4 (14. 3%) vs. 1 (2.7%); absolute risk difference 11.6% 95% CI -2% to 26%; p=0.16]. Impact of removal also favored other secondary outcomes<br><br>Conclusions: These results suggest that removal of catheter is beneficial in the management of patients with enterococcal catheter-associated bacteremia. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the interpretation of the confidence intervals suggests that removal of the catheter is likely to be beneficial. Definitive conclusions await future studies with larger sample sizes.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PHOSPHORYLATED RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN LEVELS IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA PLASMA CELLS
Yiran Su
Clayton High School, Clayton, MO

The genetic aberrations in multiple myeloma cells are complex and poorly understood. A recurrent abnormality involves monoallelic deletion of chromosome 13, which targets the tumor-suppressor gene, retinoblastoma (RB1). The effect of monoallelic deletions of RB1 on its protein product, pRB, which is frequently inactivated by phosphorylation, is unclear. The objective of this study was to establish a quantitative relationship between phosphorylated pRB and RB1 gene dose in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and to test the relationship in patient samples. Since pRB is a nuclear protein, cells were fixed and permeabilized to allow entry of antibodies. The secondary antibody was conjugated with the Alexa Fluor 488 dye, which was detected through flow cytometry. DNA content was simultaneously analyzed for cells in S and M phases since phosphorylated pRB is mainly present in those phases. The quantitative analysis of phosphorylated pRB in myeloma cells was achieved with the use of microspheres. The results from the HMCLs indicate a correlation between phosphorylated pRB levels and RB1 gene dose. Preliminary experimentation shows that the novel technique used for the determination of RB1 gene dose through flow cytometry in HMCLs may also apply to primary multiple myeloma patient samples. Future work will include testing the relationship between phosphorylated pRB levels and RB1 gene dose in patient samples. These findings increase the understanding of the genetic aberrations prevalent in multiple myeloma.

INFLUENCES OF CINNAMOMUM CASSIA ON PRE-DIABETIC CHARACTERISTICS
Ashley Nicole Hoehn
Ottoville Local Schools, Ottoville, OH

Millions of Americans undergo expensive and painful treatments to control their blood sugar. As reported in previous studies, herbs may aid in reducing blood sugar. This experiment studies cinnamon as a sugar modulator. If so, it would be a cheaper and less painful method to lower blood sugar.<br><br> This researcher hypothesized if pre-diabetic subjects checked their blood sugar levels for two months, then only those subjects taking the cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) capsules will have statistically significant decreases in their blood sugar levels.<br><br> There were three trial groups in this experiment that checked and recorded their blood sugar every morning. The first group was the control group. The second group, the placebo group, took a placebo capsule (1000 mg). The last group, the cinnamon group, took a cinnamon capsule (1000 mg). All of the groups kept a daily food log and each test subject's data was statistically analyzed using a t-test.<br><br> After experimentation it was verified that taking one cinnamon capsule every morning for two months did decrease the blood sugar of the test subjects by an average of 13.41% (p= 1.41E-55). The placebo group’s blood sugar increased by an average of 0.53% (p= 0.125). The control group’s blood sugar increased by an average of 0.95% (p= 0.224).<br><br> It is concluded that the hypothesis was supported. This experiment showed that cinnamon would be an affordable and non-invasive method for pre-diabetic individuals to manage their blood sugar.

ENGINEERING AND VALIDATING PREDICTIVE INFECTION SURVEILLANCE STRATEGIES FOR METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Stephen Walter Trusheim
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic at nearly every hospital in America, infecting an estimated 94,000 patients every year and directly killing more than 19,000. To prevent MRSA outbreaks, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement recommends that hospitals employ “universal surveillance,” which involves testing every admitted patient for MRSA; however, nearly all hospitals employ less-effective MRSA surveillance strategies, due to cost.<br><br> To reduce costs of MRSA surveillance while ensuring that all cases of MRSA are identified, I developed a new surveillance strategy that I termed “predictive surveillance.” I engineered four software components based on predictive healthcare methods and validated the components against data from prior studies. I first engineered a LogitBoost algorithm to accurately predict MRSA-colonized patients, then used those predictions to recommend specific MRSA tests for each patient. I next engineered software that generated accurate cost-estimates for every available MRSA surveillance strategy and, finally, engineered an interactive website that provides this software to hospitals, clinics, and the public.<br><br> Results suggest hospital cost-savings of more than 25% per year associated with use of my predictive surveillance strategy. This cost-savings will enable more hospitals to employ effective means of MRSA surveillance, preventing further spread of this deadly infectious disease.

A SYNESTHETIC EXPERIENCE
Kristin Ellice McClain
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

Synesthesia is a medical condition in which the person’s senses are combined. For example, a person may see the color blue whenever he/she hears the sound of a door closing. All of a synesthete’s experiences are constant; they never change, and are directional- the combination only goes in one direction, color to sound not sound to color. Synesthesia has been around for awhile, but is just recently being studied again. Scientists are still not sure of what causes Synesthesia. My purpose is: Synesthesia affects from every 1 in 200 to 1 in 100,000 people are there any common factors that synesthete’s share? By data mining, I will send a survey to people who have Synesthesia and determine if factors such as gender, age, environment, or genetics are contributing factors that induce Synesthesia. Using an online forum, I sent a survey to synesthetes. Gathering their responses, I tried to find if they have any common traits such as the hand they write with, gender, and/or common types of Synesthesia. Thirty-one people responded to the survey. I input the information in Microsoft Excel, and used the sort and find options to find the number of times each answer on the survey occurred. The percentage of each answer was calculated and the results compared. The top results from each category (10) were compiled and then evaluated. According to my analysis, some examples of common traits appear to be: females, Caucasian descent, right-handedness, and grapheme-color or spatial layout Synesthesia.

CD11B+ MONOCYTE INFILTRATION INTO CNS FOLLOWING M1 ACTIVATION
Bahar Bipin Shah
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

The role of microglia during neuroinflammation consists of a classical response (M1) which is comprised of tissue damage, inflammation, and pathogen destruction. The study hypothesized that a M1 activating stimulus would trigger microglia and would induce peripheral infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. Additionally, a time-course study examining the optimal duration and strength of the activating stimulus occurred. The 0-day time-course was hypothesized to be more effective.<br><br> <br><br>Fluorescent immunostaining for GFP qualitatively demonstrated that GFP+ CD11B+ monocytic cells migrated across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. The M1 activating stimulus, a cytokine cocktail of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-1beta, was strong enough to induce the infiltration of the peripheral monocytes across the blood brain barrier. Once inside the Central Nervous System (CNS), the infiltrating monocytes also migrated towards the sites of inflammation. The 0-day time-course induced a larger amount of infiltrating monocytes.<br><br> <br><br>Monocytes appear to be a possible alternative to the use of viral vectors in delivering cell-based therapies. Viral vectors have caused problems by activating recessive genes; monocytes do not cause these problems. Further research needs to be done concerning the monocytes, but manipulating monocytes to express enzymes, like an amyloid-degrading enzyme, may offer a powerful novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Using monocytes, rather than viruses as gene therapy vectors for therapeutic cell treatments may reduce the possibility of problems as a result of the vectors, and lead to further breakthroughs in the treatment processes.

A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS COLONIZATION OF PET-THERAPY DOGS
Hunter Jackson Smith
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

This study was designed to determine if there is a higher prevalence of colonization with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in pet-therapy dogs than a control group. A cross-sectional study design was chosen to measure the association between the disease (MRSA) and the risk factor (pet-therapy) and to assess the current level of MRSA in the community. A total of 150 samples, consisting of anal and rectal swabs, were collected from 75 dogs. The swabs were cultured on CHROMagar plates and positive MRSA colonies were confirmed with a coagulase test. A total of 29 dogs were MRSA positive. This included 12 of 27 (44.4%) of the pet-therapy dogs and 17 of 48 (35.4%) of the controls. This difference was not significant at the 95% confidence level. Nasal testing was determined to be more sensitive than anal with 27 of 29 (93.1%) of the MRSA cases positive on nasal and 4 of 29 (13.8%) on anal (two dogs were positive on both). A questionnaire distributed to the dog owners revealed that none of the recognized risk factors for MRSA (antibiotic use, recent hospitalization, healthcare employment, and age) were found to be significant in this survey. The only significant risk factor was the consumption of raw meat by the dogs. The source of the MRSA is unclear as strain typing was not done on the isolates. The incidence of MRSA (38.7%) was far higher than expected, indicating that MRSA is an emerging pathogen in canines and may represent a significant public health threat.

MODELING AND SIMULATION OF ANEURYSM BLOOD FLOW INTERACTION
Alicia Hamar
H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program, Arlington, VA

Over the last decade, there have been several attempts to understand the mechanics of an aneurysm interacting with the blood flow. Identifying the key bio mechanical factors can help understand, predict and diagnose rupture of these lesions well in advance. In this preliminary work, my objective was to perform a research study to understand the behavior of blood flow in the presence of aneurysm. <br><br> I used mathematical modeling and computer simulations to analyze the effects of aneurysms arising in a normal arterial blood-flow system. A multi-physics package was used to create the computer simulations in which the velocity fields of the different sizes of the aneurysms were compared to observe the affect of the aspect blood ratio on the blood flow dynamics.

IDENTIFICATION AND PREVENTION OF MRSA TRANSFERRED BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND MEDICAL SETTINGS ON MOBILE PHONES
Karen Ashley Kruzer
West Geauga High School, Chesterland, OH

The growth of community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) presents a striking public health challenge. Prevalence in community and healthcare settings is rising and antibiotic resistance is increasing. It is hypothesized that if medical staff use mobile phones throughout shifts and phones are not properly disinfected, then MRSA can be transferred between the community and healthcare facilities.<br><br> Sterile swabs were taken from phones of 30 patient-care nursing home staff pre-shift and cultured to identify pathogens brought into the facility. The phones were then disinfected with alcohol wipes. Plates were incubated and bacteria identified through gram stains and Staphaurex. 33.3% of phones carried pathogens into the nursing facility, with 13% positive for CA-MSSA and 20% positive for CA-MRSA. Swabs from the same 30 phones were cultured post-shift to identify pathogens acquired within the nursing home. 23.3% carried pathogens back into the community, with 10% positive for hospital-acquired MSSA (HA-MSSA) and 13.3% positive for HA-MRSA. <br><br> A Staphylococcus Education Program was presented to 519 high school students, with effectiveness assessed through 10-question pre/post-tests. Following education, 76.1% of students understood SA effects, 69.9% understood superbugs, 91.5% understood prevalence, and 69.2% felt they could identify SA infections. Disinfecting mobile phones and implementing Staphylococcus education proved effective. Effective hand hygiene, including disinfecting frequently handled objects is crucial, especially near vulnerable populations. Prevention practices involving community education combined with effective hygiene practices will reduce the number of staphylococcus infections.

ARTEMISIA- A HOMEOPATHIC INSECT REPELLENT?
Aracella Jade Ramos
Box Elder Public Schools, Box Elder, MT

Abstract<br><br>Sage (Artemisia) is literally a hardcore plant that can survive in dry, hot climates or cold, barren areas. For this reason it has survived in areas such as Montana and as an abundant plant, it has been used over the years for a variety of things. From seasoning, to prayers, to medicinal uses, sage was and has always been used as a homeopathic alternative. Recently it’s been used as an ingredient in some insect repellents. In the Native American culture sage was hung around dry meat so that flies and insects would not soil the meat; sometimes the sage was burned. Seeing as how our world today is turning to homeopathic alternatives, I explored the effects of sage and the way it can naturally repel insects. Four methods were tested: Fresh sage plants, dry sage plants, burning sage and an essential oil mixture created by grinding leaves in an organic solvent. The results proved my hypothesis correct and they also show that when used in the essential oil form, it repelled 100% of insects as compared to 83% shown by the control experiment.

RAT FAT?
Ana Alicia Vela
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener found in many foods today. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes has increased significantly since its production in the 1970’s. The purpose of this project was to determine if a HFCS diet would negatively impact diabetes indicators, such as cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood glucose levels. <br><br>This study used four groups of seven Rattus norvegicus. The rats had initial blood draws to determine cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Blood glucose levels were also tested initially and then twice weekly throughout the study. One test group was given a diet with appropriate nutrients and sugar in the form of cane molasses and dried beet pulp because these contain equal parts glucose and fructose, and given exercise wheel access. The second group was put on the same diet but remained sedentary. The third group was put on HFCS diet by mixing corn syrup into the food and given exercise wheel access. The fourth group was also put on the HFCS diet but remained sedentary. After being on the diet for two and a half weeks, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were retested.<br><br>Blood glucose levels for the rats on the HFCS diet rose. Cholesterol levels for the rats on the HFCS diet dropped or remained constant. The triglyceride levels for those on the HFCS diet fell significantly in one group and slightly rose in the other. Therefore, results did not support the hypothesis that a HFCS diet would negatively affect diabetes indicators over the short term.

CAVEOLIN-1 REGULATION OF PATHOLOGICAL ANGIOGENESIS IN IBD
Justin Alan Terracciano
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders which affect the gastrointestinal tract. The pathological process of IBD involves inflammation, ulceration, and regeneration of the intestinal mucosa. Angiogenesis has recently been found to play a crucial role in this pathological process by exacerbating disease conditions. We showed that inhibition of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a structural protein reported to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, through the use of AP-Cav (a Cav-1 inhibitory peptide) significantly reduces disease pathology in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of IBD. Mice treated with AP-Cav displayed decreased histopathology. We hypothesized that Cav-1’s regulation of angiogenesis was a cause of this. We found that AP-Cav treated mice with DSS IBD demonstrated significantly reduced angiogenesis in colon tissue. Further testing revealed that AP-Cav reduces colon endothelial cell proliferation in response to angiogenic cytokines, a primary step in angiogenesis. The AP-Cav peptide also disrupts vascular endothelial growth factor cell signaling and enothelial cell migration. These data suggest that Cav-1 is a key regulator of pathological angiogenesis in IBD and that inhibition of Cav-1 could be a novel therapeutic intervention for IBD.

DETERMINING THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECT IN HUMAN LUNG CANCER CELLS BY QUERCETIN
Shannon Renee Sacksteder
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

Current cancer research is studying plant flavanoids in hopes of finding new cures. The purpose of this project was to determine the optimal serial dilution of quercetin to inhibit lung cancer cell growth. If lung cancer cells were exposed to quercetin, the flavonoid would have antiproliferative effects on lung cancer cells. Human lung cancer cells were placed into flasks containing 5mL of tissue culture medium. The culture was checked daily, and the medium was replaced every 48 hours. When the cells multiplied and reached a confluency of 80%, they were trypsinized, collected, and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 5000 cells/well in growth culture medium. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with another medium which lacked hormones. After another 24 hours, the cells were treated with optimal concentrations of quercetin. The concentrations of quercetin used in this experiment included 25, 50, 75 and 100 nM and mM. Two controls were also applied: the untreated cells and a DMSO treatment. Cell proliferation was determined by applying proliferation assays on days 2 and 4, and absorbance readings were performed using a microplate reader. Each treatment was applied to the growing cells four times. Using the proliferation data collected, the LD50 for quercetin was determined. These procedures were completely repeated twice. In addition, another experiment was run using these same exact procedures. However, concentrations were added between the 100nM and 25uM treatments. Also, 0.2% DMSO was used in this experiment instead of 2% DMSO. The results showed that the concentration it took for the cells to reach an LD50 (50 percent cell apoptosis) was 67.9uM for experiment 1, 97.9uM for experiment 2, and 82.2uM for experiment 3. Most concentrations were statistically significant compared to the DMSO control. There was rarely a linear decrease in cell proliferation as higher concentrations of quercetin were applied. However, the LD50 was determined and therefore, the hypothesis was supported.

AN EASY SCREENING SYSTEM FOR ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS
Celia Denise Viermann
Gymnasium des Englischen Instituts Heidelberg, Heidelberg, GERMANY

The disease pattern of epilepsy is based on a balance shift between excitation and inhibition in neuronal networks. Antiepileptic drugs rebalance this deranged equation. Some of these drugs have been shown to increase apoptosis in neurons. <br><br>The project’s content was to develop an in vitro model, based on a primary neuronal rat hippocampus cell culture to investigate the effect of antiepileptics on apoptosis. The method of choice was a stain with DAPI which accumulates into the DNA and thereby creates a fluorescent complex. Thus, the structure of the cell nuclei is revealed under a fluorescent microscope, offering differentiability between healthy and characteristic fragmented apoptotic nuclei. Furthermore, it was possible to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory cells by marking specific proteins with an antibody-stain. <br><br>The model was proven effective for Diazepam and Phenobarbital making the system a cheap and quick option to check newly developed drugs. <br><br>Interestingly, the attempt to increase apoptosis by higher drug concentrations or longer incubation-times saturated at a 60-70%-proportion of apoptotic cells. This raises the questions which cells die and which survive. If, for example, most of the apoptotic cells were causally involved in the emergence or maintenance of the misbalanced network, the apoptosis-increasing impact may not be a side-effect but may also have positive effects. This knowledge could help in the development of new therapy strategies.<br><br>So far it was not possible to clearly identify the group of apoptotic cells but it stays a phenomenon on which epilepsy-research may focus in future.

HOW CAN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING AND TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION BE USED TO MAP FINGER MOVEMENTS IN MY BRAIN?
Katarina Lundervold
Bergen Katedralskole, Bergen, Hordaland, NORWAY

The present work considers the study of the human motor system using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The research question investigated was: How can MRI and TMS be used to map the motor cortex representation of my finger movements? To answer this I was subject to a combined MRI and TMS examination. Even if the technology was complicated, we were able to elicit finger movements using TMS and the localization of the stimulation could be assessed by co-registered MRI. In this report I give an introduction to the field, description of the technology and methods being used as well as the results obtained, followed by discussion and a critical analysis and possible improvements of the experimental procedures. In conclusion, by performing a combined experiment with the help of co-registered MRI with the TMS coil, it was possible to map the motor cortical representation of the motor hand area in my brain.

PREVENTION OF VASCULAR DISEASE
Federico Stipanicic
NO 15 "Ibiray", Montevideo, URUGUAY

Cardiovascular risk factors in the High School population of Liceo Nº 15 “Ibiray”, Montevideo, Uruguay, are the subject of the study of “Prevention of Vascular Disease”. The importance of this project is because vascular disease is the first cause of deaths not only in Uruguay, but also in the world. The best way to prevent it is to change life habits, adopting healthy ones since childhood and adolescence. <br><br> The aim of this project is to evaluate the situation of the students of my high school regarding risk factors. The results obtained in this study could lead to support the need for habit modification, in turn preventing vascular disease and a better quality of life. The hypothesis managed in this project was that an important percentage of students of my high school (greater than 20%) presented at least one risk factor for developing vascular disease. This survey has detected that there is a young population (students of “Liceo Nº15 Ibiray”) at risk for developing vascular pathology. <br><br> The results not only confirm, but markedly exceed the values stipulated in the hypothesis. In view of the alarming results, and the need to implement healthy habits as soon as possible in order to decrease these values, a sports plan and a healthy nutrition guide were designed.

DESIGNING HETEROLOGOUS INFLUENZA VACCINE FOR NEW PANDEMIC PATHOGEN EMERGING IN HUMANS INFECTED WITH AVIAN INFLUENZA
Alexander Chernyakhovsky
William Mason High School, Mason, OH

Influenza A viruses, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 strains, undergo punctuated genetic evolutions in Hemagglutinin (HA) that significantly alter their antigenic characteristics potentially giving rise to pandemic strains. In the past pandemic strains have emerged due to reassortment events in a host coinfected by human and avian strains. In 1997, the first outbreak of H5N1 human infections demonstrated the capability of humans to serve as mixing vessels for such reassortment events. Consequently, forecasting areas of infection of humans with avian influenza as well as timelines of outbreaks is vital for identifying strains for vaccine development to effectively combat this disease. Accordingly, this research describes a novel methodology involving the use of temporo-spatial, in silico macro-epidemiological analysis coupled with bioinformatics to identify HA isolates from regions of infection with human and avian influenza. The study involves the use of global Eco-modeling and bio-simulation to represent the macro-epidemiology of human and avian influenza. The SIR/Markov Process model is utilizes real-world statistical data on human infections with avian viruses, waterfowl migration (the primary vector of avian influenza), global poultry population (an intermediary host) and global human population. The bio-simulations are performed on supercomputer clusters. The resulting HA isolates are proposed for use in the vaccine design for geographically optimized, heterologous influenza vaccines targeted for pathogens emerging in humans infected with avian influenza viruses.

FINDING THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR INSULIN PERMEATION THROUGH PORCINE INTESTINE
Eliana Nicole Carmona
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Insulin is a large protein that is historically delivered into the human body via injection. This method is painful and uncomfortable for those who suffer from diabetes, and must inject insulin several times a day. The purpose of this research is to investigate a less painful, and efficient method of transdermal insulin permeation, by finding the ideal conditions in which the molecule could breach the skin and enter the bloodstream. The rate of permeation of insulin through a porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) was measured using the molecule’s native fluorescence at 302 nm. The permeation of insulin through the SIS was evaluated as a function of temperature, pressure exerted on the delivered insulin dosage, and small electrical current applied across the porcine membrane during permeation. Results indicate that increasing temperature from 4 degrees celsius to room temperature (23 degrees celsius) reduces the permeation of insulin through SIS by as much as 11%. Application of 1.5 & 9 volts across the membrane during permeation does not enhance permeation, where the membrane was destroyed shortly after the start of the experiment. Increase in pressure by as little as 0.02 atm on the dosage solution increases the rate of insulin permeation by more than 100 fold, from 3.9 x 10^(-4) units/ml min^(-1) (at standard pressure) to 0.050 units/ml min^(-1). A delivery pressure of 1.12 atm increases the rate of permeation to as much as 0.79 units/ml min^(-1), so that a typical Type I diabetic “5 units/ml per meal” dosage can be delivered transdermally in as little as 6.3 minutes.

ANTI-BIOFILM EFFECT OF TRANS-CINNAMALDEHYDE ON UROPATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI
Amoolya Narayanan
Glastonbury High School, Glastonbury, CT

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection in humans, with more than 100 million annual cases worldwide. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary bacterium causing UTIs in humans. Indwelling catheters for bladder drainage in humans become encrusted with UPEC biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics, resulting in chronic infections. This research investigated the efficacy of trans-cinnamaldehyde, an ingredient in cinnamon oil, for preventing UPEC biofilm. Additionally, the efficacy of trans-cinnamaldehyde as a component in catheter lock solution, for inactivating pre-formed UPEC biofilm was determined. Polystyrene microtiter plates and urinary catheters inoculated with 6.0 log CFU of UPEC were treated with trans-cinnamaldehyde (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5%) at 37oC. Similarly, catheters with UPEC biofilm were treated with lock solution containing trans-cinnamaldehyde (0, 1, 1.25, 1.5%). UPEC biofilm on control and trans-cinnamaldehyde-treated plates and catheters was determined on days 0, 1, 3 and 5 of incubation. Triplicate samples were included, and the study was replicated three times. All trans-cinnamaldehyde concentrations were effective in preventing UPEC biofilm on microtiter plates and catheters. Moreover, trans-cinnamaldehyde in catheter lock solution was effective in inactivating pre-formed UPEC biofilm on catheters. Results suggest that trans-cinnamaldehyde could potentially be applied as a coating on catheter surface or an ingredient in catheter lock solution to prevent urinary tract infections in humans. Currently studies investigating the efficacy of trans-cinnamaldehyde for inactivating UPEC biofilm in presence of urine are underway. Future experiments will determine the potential of applying nanoparticles of trans-cinnamaldehyde on urinary catheters as an antimicrobial coating.

THE EFFECT OF SUPEROXIDE ON APOB DEGRADATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
Josh Adam Elkind
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Atherosclerosis is a disease in which high cholesterol levels cause plaque to deposit in the arterial wall, possibly leading to heart attacks and strokes. One way the liver regulates blood cholesterol is by monitoring very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion via post-ER presecretory proteolysis (PERPP). This pathway, which degrades ApoB100 (protein component of VLDL), is stimulated by oxidative stress, caused by lipid peroxidation. The mechanism that activates PERPP is still unknown, and it is possible that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide (SO) is a necessary component. This notion was tested using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to stimulate ApoB degradation in a rat liver cell line that had been treated with either MnTBAP or superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Both treatments lowered intracellular SO levels making it possible to observe how SO availability influenced ApoB levels. With less SO, ApoB levels experienced a partial recovery, indicating that PERPP was inadequately stimulated. This implies that SO plays a role in the degradation of ApoB, based on the fact that when it is in relative abundance the result is increased ApoB degradation. Future research will help to determine why ApoB was only partially recovered and how the PERPP mechanism can lead to medical advances.

AQUAPORIN-4 CHANNELS REGULATE CA1 HIPPOCAMPAL LONG-TERM POTENTIATION
Ian Barry Mathews
Irvington High School, Irvington, NY

Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water-channel protein expressed in glial cell plasma membranes. Glia are non-neuronal cells that provide support and nutrition to neurons; however, little is known with regard to glial roles in higher cognition, and this paper seeks to investigate if glia do in fact modulate cognition. AQP4 was chosen because of the known importance of water channels in the brain, with edema and hyperosmolarity (dehydration) prominent examples of the problems that can arise from poor water regulation. AQP4 has been shown to play a major role in cerebral water balance, because mice without the AQP4 gene (AQP4 “knockout” or “null” mice) are protected from cytotoxic brain edema produced by water intoxication. In addition, AQP4 channels are located solely in glia, and with their modulation we can specifically target glial cells. This paper investigates synaptic transmission and plasticity in such AQP4-null mice by electrophysiological field recording in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To investigate long-term synaptic plasticity, I analyzed long-term potentiation (LTP), a common model that reflects learning and memory in hippocampal area CA1. Although I obtained no evidence that there were differences in synaptic transmission or short-term plasticity in the AQP4 knockouts compared to wild-type controls, LTP was greatly inhibited in the knockouts. This suggests that AQP4, water homeostasis, and glia may have a profound effect on long-term synaptic plasticity, and as a result significantly impact learning and memory.

SENSITIVITY OF VARIOUS IMAGING MODALITIES FOR DETECTING SOFT TISSUE CLACIUM
Jacob Harris Miller
Mamaroneck High School, Mamaroneck, NY

Calcium deposits are markers for many different types of diseases. For diagnostic purposes, it is important to know which image technique is best for scanning for calcium deposits. Four imaging processes are Ultrasound Imaging, X-rays, Computed Tomography or CT scans, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This experiment examined which out of the four scanning processes is best for discovering calcium deposits. The experiment tested a calcium supplement that mimics calcium deposits, called hydroxyapatite. The hydroxyapatite, in a powder form, was dissolved in water. Different amounts of the hydroxyapatite simulated different concentrations of calcium. The concentrations were suspended in an agar that successfully mimicked soft tissue. It was discovered that Ultrasound imaging was the most accurate at detecting calcium deposits.

ELUCIDATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AND GENE EXPRESSION AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON DRY EYE SYNDROME
Anushka Das
The Louisiana School for Math, Sciences, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

Millions are diagnosed with Dry Eye Syndrome, a disease resulting from a lack of tear production. The elderly are most affected because the lacrimal gland’s sensitivity and response in producing tears decreases with age. Dry Eye Syndrome is linked to important genes involved in processes like cell apoptosis, inflammation, or glycoprotein production. The goal of this project was to document gene expression in eye genes of Fischer 344 rats aged 4, 12, 18, and 24 months. A Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit was used to harvest tissue from the lacrimal gland; the RNA examples were then mixed with a 5x buffer, RT enzyme, and sterile water for cDNA synthesis using a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Biorad Laboratories) for conversion to DNA and amplification. Real Time Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green Supermix, with conditions adjusted to each primer. Among the subset of tested genes, the Serum and Glucocortoid-Regulated Kinase, Melanoma Inhibitory Activity, UDP Galactose Transporter- related Isozyme 1, and Lipocortin showed a statistically significant decrease with age. The other genes tested, Eotaxin ligand 11, Melancortin 5 Receptor, Beta-Adregenic Receptor Kinase-1, and Neural Visinin-like Ca Binding Protein Type 3 did not show any significant increase or decrease. The observed decrease in the expression of the affected genes indicates that aging in the lacrimal gland is associated with protein binding and cell programmed apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation, glycoprotein production, and protein defense to infections. It is probable that the experimental results validating the Rat Dry Eye Model will provide a future basis for understanding how these genes affect the overall aging process in humans and should be examined further.

CARDIAC DISEASE DETECTION: A STUDY OF THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF A HUMAN PHONOCARDIOGRAM
Darren Jindal
Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Baton Rouge, LA

Phonocardiography is an upcoming, non-invasive technique for monitoring cardiac health. The purpose of this study was to establish the defining characteristics of the human phonocardiogram and to examine the technique’s potential as a stand alone diagnostic tool for cardiac disease.<br><br> The phonocardiograms of high school juniors and seniors (test population) were recorded using home-made and commercial electronic stethoscopes linked to a laptop with sound processing software. To ensure high fidelity, the electronic signal was sampled at 44,100 samples per second. The test population consisted of individuals with varying race, gender, weight, and height. The test subjects were in a relaxed physical and emotional state.<br><br> Each phonocardiogram, consisting of 25 pairs of S1 and S2 heart sounds was analyzed extensively. This analysis included comparison of the time-domain waveforms through time-shift and superimposition algorithms and of the frequency-domain waveforms generated through Fast Fourier Transform with a Hanning window.<br><br> The following clinical implications emerged: 1) A healthy adult phonocardiogram is essentially independent of race, gender, weight, and height. 2) The defining characteristic of the healthy adult phonocardiogram is the frequency spectrum derived from the acoustic vibrations produced by the closure of the heart’s atrioventricular and semilunar valves. 3) Significant deviations from a normal spectrum can point to a cardiac abnormality. This was demonstrated through successful diagnosis of non-simultaneous semilunar valve closure. 4) Minor septal defects can be successfully confirmed through the existence of the S3 waveform. Due to ease of digital archival, the phonocardiogram can serve as a chronological record of cardiac health.

PROGRAMMING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES WITHIN A PARTIALLY STOCHASTIC MULTIPLE-CITY SIMULATION
Nolan M. K. Kamitaki
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

This project sought to combine a stochastic airport network with a deterministic population model in order to effectively model the spread of epidemics across the globe. It is thought that the efficiency of simplified interactions may allow for larger, multiple population simulations. Seasonal influenza was used as a test case to investigate properties of airport transmission regarding the spread of disease. 84 different simulation setups were run 5000 times each for a total of 420,000 test runs. <br><br> It was found that increasing the network density, lowering the percentage of airport closures, and increasing the time delay before first initial response all contributed to a higher mortality rate across the network. Although this might seem like a relatively obvious or unimportant conclusion to draw, it can be used to see if any other phenomena exist through analyzing recorded data. <br><br> Additionally, it was also found that as network density decreases, increasing the initial time delay before first medical responses has less of an effect on increasing mortality. At the start of this experiment, it was considered plausible that in a less connected network, any additional city infected would greatly increase the relative mortality rate. However, it was found that the slowed spread contributed more to intervention efficiency than did increases derived from a smaller overall mortality. <br><br> The combination of stochastic and deterministic elements proved to create a viable simulation setup for observing epidemic dynamics. This project also highlights the need for additional computer modeling research in the field of epidemiology.

DETECTION OF PANTON-VALENTINE LEUKOCIDIN (PVL) GENE AMONG METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Jessica Tak Wright
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a growing medical crisis because of its resistance to numerous antibiotics. The two most common forms of MRSA are HA-MRSA (hospital-acquired MRSA) and CA-MRSA (community–associated MRSA). Both types have the gene called mecA, which determines the methicillin resistance of MRSA. CA-MRSA is the more virulent variant and is characterized by the toxin Panton – Valentine leukocidin (PVL) which attacks our body’s white blood cells, dramatically weakening the immune system. <br><br>The purpose of my project was to develop the skills to detect PVL and determine its distribution among MRSA DNA. Knowing the PVL distribution among MRSA DNA samples allows me to study the distribution of PVL, MRSA, and more specifically CA-MRSA throughout different groups within the society. The DNA samples were from nurses and football players infected with MRSA. These samples were obtained by other researchers and I only handled these samples in DNA form. I predicted that the football players would have a higher percentage of strains positive with PVL and my tests proved my hypothesis correct.<br><br>My tests included the use of Polymerase-Chain Reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis gel. In the gel, PVL+ samples display a distinct yellow band in ultraviolet light, which identifies the CA-MRSA strains.<br><br>Four of the five football players’ DNA were positive for PVL versus three of the seven nurses. From these results I concluded that the more virulent CA-MRSA is more commonly spread throughout the football community than the hospital environment.

THE EFFECTS OF AGED GARLIC EXTRACT ON THE GROWTH OF CANINE OSTEOSARCOMA TUMOR CELLS IN VITRO
Se Woong Jeong
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke, VA

Although the incidence of bone cancer is low each year, when diagnosed, the tumors tend to be severe; a majority of patients die within one to three years. Osteosarcoma tumors have a tendency to develop near the long bones but they are also known to develop near the jaw or the shoulders. Specific compounds from the Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract products are known to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. However, little research has been done on the effects the products themselves have on different cancer cell lines. This study evaluated the aged garlic extract product’s ability to inhibit the canine OOS osteosarcoma tumor cells in tissue culture. Each phase required three consecutive days at the laboratory at a regional university. On day one, the osteosarcoma tumor cells were plated at specific levels in the 96 well plate. Next day, the tumor cells were dosed with the diluted garlic extracts at the selected dosage levels. On the final day, the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit was used to check the wells for the viable cell count after dosage. Surprisingly, the diluted garlic extract powder did not have any inhibitory effects on the tumor cells. However, at low dosages, generally 10 µg/mL to 100 µg/mL, the garlic extract had either a stimulating effect on the tumor cells or it protected cells from apoptosis. Although further trials need to be performed, the study’s findings could lead to an alternative view of these commercially available herbal supplements.

DIFFERENCES IN TISSUE QUALITY AS MEASURED WITH TISSUE MICROARRAYS AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Lauren Kelly Lewis
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Due to metastasis, a tumor sample must be processed and viewed to diagnose cancer. No standard method for processing tissues exists, preventing tissue quality optimization. I conducted this experiment to determine if varying processing techniques affect tissue quality and to test methods that can aid in the immunophenotyping of cells.<br><br> Upon sectioning and deparaffinizing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, I ran immunohistochemistries on a tissue microarray of all tested tissues. I tested two methods to improve tissue quality: application of ammonium hydroxide [NH3(aq)] and tissue reprocessing. I performed cellular stains on reprocessed tissues and non-reprocessed tissues.<br><br> When treated with NH3(aq), tissue sectioning significantly improved. A hematoxylin counterstain and eosin stain on reprocessed tissues revealed specific stains that resembled black nuclei, but a subsequent eosin stain of new tissue sections failed to produce black nuclei. Another eosin stain with a variability in air exposure showed that the appearance of black nuclei correlated with air exposure.<br><br> Sections processed after application of NH3(aq) produced the highest quality tissue. Both non-reprocessed and reprocessed tissues contained black nuclei after a 24 hour air exposure; data suggested that air bubbles had formed through reintroduction of paraffin to tissues that were not fully deparaffinized. Air bubbles in processed tissues can appear to be nuclei-specific and be mistaken as false positives in various stains.

ANNONA MURICATA: A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
Rochelle Lee Gotay
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of the investigation is to figure out the effect of an ethanol extract of Annona muricata in the growth of the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. This idea was obtain after reading a scientific journal and noticing the plant natural properties. Since typical treatments are so harmful, this natural idea will treat leukemia in a less harmful way. For the experimentation, a pure leave extract of Annona muricata was obtained. The cell culture was cultivated and left in a cell incubator. The extract was diluted with ethanol before being added. There were several groups per dilution, a control and a vector, in this group was evaluated the effect of ethanol on leukemia cell. The control group had cells without any treatment. After the 24, 48 and 72 hours the cells were counted in an hemocytometer; and its absorption plus the cytotoxicity with the dilution of the extract was summated to a MTS test. The results were that both test had partially the same result: the extract did work. In terms of cytotoxicity, the extract had proven to work on this cell line, reducing its level in a significant way. Also, the vector and control group, always maintain its initial level; meaning the ethanol is not affecting the result where the extract was used.

EFFECT OF AFLATOXIN B1 FROM THE ASPERGILLUS FLAVU ON MDA-MB-231 HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Ana Victoria Colon
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Aflatoxin is a known carcinogen, expelled from naturally occurring fungi such as Aspergillus flavu. In this experiment, aflatoxin in different concentrations was placed in samples of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and observed for five days to determine the effect a carcinogen has on cancer cells. Four samples of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were prepared: a Control (no aflatoxin), 10 µm/gm aflatoxin B1, 50 µm/gm aflatoxin B1, and 100 µm/gm aflatoxin B1. The change in cell number was determined by cell counting. The Control sample showed constant increase from days 1 to 4, going from 9 to 64 cells. The 10 µm/gm aflatoxin B1 sample cell count dropped from day 1 to 2, but then increased from 6 to 19 cells from day 2 to 4. The 50 µm/gm sample showed a constant decrease in cell number from day 1 to 4, but on day 5 the cell number rose slightly from 2 to 5. The 100 µm/gm sample showed no cells on days 1, 3, 4, and 5; and only 1 cell on day 2. This shows that aflatoxin B1 in a 100 µm/gm concentration terminated the breast cancer cells; while the other concentrations did decrease the number of breast cancer cells in comparison to the control. The morphological study proved that the cells were decreasing each day, and dying as the aflatoxin B1 affected its growth cycle. Because the cells died due to toxin exposure, their death is qualified as necrosis.

SUPER OLIGODENDROCYTES: REMYELINATING MS LESIONS USING LAMININ AND IMMUNOMODULATORS
Jourdan Brandt Urbach
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

During the autoimmune attack of diseases like MS, the myelin sheath that encapsulates neurons and enables proper signal conduction is attacked, causing degeneration of the underlying axon tracts. Current MS treatments operate by diminishing the strength of the autoimmune attack, but do not address the loss of function due to resultant demyelination. In previous years' research, I had demonstrated that oligodendrocytes exposed to the ECM protein laminin in combination with immunomodulators differentiated at a rate 530% and proliferated at a rate 135% greater than those treated with the current leading MS treatment, Interferon-Beta. In order to myelinate, oligodendrocytes must exhibit proper adhesion, characterized by attachment to an axon, or by aggregating in large clumps of cells. This study hypothesizes that increasing the adhesive ability of oligodendrocytes significantly enhances the efficacy of myelination in the CNS, bolstering the ability to recover from MS lesions. Oligodendrocytes were grown in a medium containing either IFN-beta, Interleukin 2, or a control, and on a substrate either of laminin or Poly-D-Lysine, a nutrient base. A process length analysis was used to determine relative morphological complexity and differentiation and an MBP immunostaining assay was employed to ascertain maturity, aggregation, and MBP content. Analysis of the MBP stained oligodendrocytes yields striking results: an 180% increase in overall MBP content, a 235% increase in aggregation, and a 200% increase in MBP concentration in those oligodendrocytes exposed to the cocktail over those exposed to the current leading MS therapy. The process length assay demonstrates that oligodendrocytes exposed to the cocktail differentiated 5.3 times faster than control oligodendrocytes. These results provide strong evidence to suggest that these “Super Oligodendrocytes” could myelinate at a rate far greater than those oligodendrocytes currently at the lesion site.

THE NOVEL PROPERTY OF THE CIRCULATING HORMONE AM AND ITS BINDING PROTEIN: NEUROPROTECTION IN HYPOXIA
Stephanie Mian Wang
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Brain ischemia is the underlying cause of neuronal death during stroke and trauma. In fact, in the United States alone, nearly 1.4 million people are affected by traumatic and ischemic brain injuries every year (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control). Neural cells exposed to the condition of oxygen depletion in ischemia undergo apoptosis which significantly contributes to brain injury. Adrenomedullin (AM), a multifunctional hormone/peptide, in combination with its enhancing binding protein, AMBP-1, has been shown to effectively reduce tissue damage in hemorrhage models. However, no studies have yet utilized AM/AMBP-1 to ameliorate conditions of oxygen-deprived neurons. <br><br> To evaluate the effects of AM/AMBP-1 administration in brain ischemia, an in vitro model of neuronal hypoxia was employed using differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. After exposure to 1% O2 for 20 h, neural damage was evidenced by a reduction of cellular ATP levels and an increase of lactate dehydrogenase release. Pre-administration of AM/AMBP-1 significantly attenuated hypoxia-induced cell injury. Moreover, AM/AMBP-1 treatment decreased neural cell apoptosis, as demonstrated by its ability to reduce the number of TUNEL-positive cells and downregulate the activation of caspase-3. AM/AMBP-1 also prevented a reduction of cAMP levels after hypoxia and promoted the activation of the downstream signaling molecule of cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA). These results indicate that AM/AMBP-1 elevates intracellular cAMP levels and thus activates PKA activity in order to protect neural cells from hypoxia-induced injury. These novel findings have considerable biomedical implications for developing AM/AMBP-1 as an effective therapeutic agent to reduce neural injury caused by brain ischemia.

MYOELECTRIC CONTROL: CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH A STUDY OF EMG ACTIVITY
William Joseph Edwards
Bonney Lake High School, Bonney Lake, WA

The electrical signals produced by muscle contraction can be harnessed for use as control signals for various myoelectrically controlled devices. To do so, electromyographic (EMG) signals are converted from an analog signal into a digital signal and sent via a wireless connection to a myoelectrically controlled device. As a result of the processing and wireless connection that most major controllers use, there is a time delay between the instance of muscle contraction and the instance of a reacting function. This study analyzes the EMG signals produced by different muscle groups and how varying the muscle group used for myoelectric control may affect the response time of a myoelectric controller. EMG signals were collected through the use of surface EMG electrodes and data collection software to discover the motor unit action potential (MUAP) for fifteen different muscle groups determined to be most feasible for myoelectric control. The collected data ranged from a low output of 0.4418mV MUAP for the Flexor Carpi Radialls to a high of 2.5861mV MUAP for the Bicep muscle. An analysis of variance of this information found that the data collected for each group was accurate (p-value < .0001) and further analysis using the Tukey-Kramer method found that the MUAPs of each muscle could be divided into eight groups based on their statistical differences. It was thereby determined that the Bicep muscle would result in the quickest reaction or functionality of a myoelectric controller since its MUAP surpassed all other muscle groups tested in the experiment.

DOES RED WINE EVERY DAY KEEP THE GREY HAIR AWAY?
Ashley Marie Thelen
Mitchell Senior High, Mitchell, SD

Aging is defined as the accumulation of cell damage over regeneration and repair in an organism. When cell renewal declines, homeostatic imbalance and ultimately death result. Trans-3,5,4'-Trihydroxystilbene, an "anti-aging" substance found in red wine, commonly called resveratrol, can slow aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. To further assess the effects of resveratrol on cell repair and regeneration, California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegates) were chosen. This system allowed for the development of a simple assay to assess growth and development. An increased regeneration rate of segments would indicate that resveratrol effectively delays the aging process in these organisms.<br><br>Toxicity levels were determined by placing segments into different concentrations of resveratrol prepared from tablets. Deaths resulted at concentrations above 6.50 ppm suggesting an upper limit of toxicity.<br><br>To assess the effects of resveratrol on regeneration rates, the head and tail ends of twenty blackworms were removed and remaining portions were cut into five 0.5 cm sections. Each section was placed into one of the following resveratrol concentrations: 0.00, 0.325, 0.65, 3.25, and 6.50 ppm. After 7 days, a t-test revealed significant increased head and tail segment regeneration rates. On average, segments exposed to 0.325 ppm resveratrol generated 91% more head segments and 105% more tail segments than the controls.<br><br>This data suggests that resveratrol, at the proper dose, can enhance cell growth and regeneration in these organisms. Further research will test pure resveratrol instead of tablet form to possibly negate the effects of additives in the tablets.

ERYTHROPOIETIN: FRIEND OR FOE TO BREAST CANCER CELL LINES?
Joy Ebunoluwa Obayemi
Academy of Medical Science Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Erythropoietin, a glycoprotein produced by the kidneys, stimulates erythropoiesis, and therefore is often used to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia. Several clinical trials have reported significant tumor progression and life threatening side effects in some patients with head, neck, and breast cancers when treated with erythropoietin. As a result, in 2007 a black-box warning was placed on the therapeutic agent, epoetin alpha, and other erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). The goal of this experiment was to investigate the anti-apoptotic or proliferative effects of erythropoietin on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Cells were cultured and treated with varying concentrations of erythropoietin (1U, 10U, 100U/mL) for 48 hours. Viability was determined by the MTS assay. Interestingly, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines demonstrated significant proliferation (P<0.05) only at the 1U/mL concentration, the lowest concentration. It is hypothesized this may be due to the threshold concentration at which erythropoietin receptors cluster. Also investigated was the affect of erythropoietin combined with the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, as some research has found erythropoietin interferes with the chemotherapeutic agent. The data demonstrates a significant increase (p<0.05) in the viability of the cancer cells when cisplatin is added to both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells pretreated with erythropoietin compared to the cisplatin control. Because these two cell lines are known to secrete hypoxia-induced erythropoietin, comparisons were also made between the production of erythropoietin in normoxia and hypoxia, in order to simulate the effects of oxygen deprivation within solid tumors. When grown under hypoxic conditions, there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the amount of erythropoietin secreted as well as a significant increase (p<0.05) in proliferation in both cell lines. By uncovering more about the relationship between various cancer cell lines and erythropoietin, the efficacy of this common treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia can be improved.

FORE FOOT, MID-FOOT,AND HEELSTRIKE WHICH RUNNING FORM PRODUCES THE LEAST AMOUNT OF STRAIN/INJURIES
John Ryan Hooton
Herculaneum High School, Herculaneum, MO

My study was about which running form produces the least amount of strain on the leg. During my research, I learned that running form mostly referred to how and where you land on the foot during the support phase of running and that most of the information available as to which is the best form is based on opinion.<br><br> As a cross country runner, I wanted to scientifically find the safest form of running to protect my legs. My hypothesis was that if the ankle, knee, and hip joints are set to angles according to the pictures of each of the four different types of running forms, then the mid-foot with no lean will have the least amount of strain on the muscles and tendons of the leg. To test this hypothesis I added a protractor and spring to the hip and ankle joints of the model leg I built for last years experiment. To measure the strain, I placed each joint at the proper degree for each form, adjusted the tension on each spring until equilibrium was reached. I then measured each spring with a ruler subtracting the resting spring measurment which gave me the data to tell me which running form created the most strain. The results supported my hypothesis. Therefore, if I run landing on the mid part of my foot without leaning, I will have less strain on the majority of my leg muscles and tendons.

THE ROLE OF REGULATORY T CELLS IN EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS
Connie M Fu
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting about 400,000 people in the US. MS is studied through a mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which causes symptoms similar to those of MS in humans, including paralysis. However, some humans develop MS while others remain healthy. Likewise, some mouse strains are susceptible to EAE induction while others are resistant. By understanding why certain mouse strains can resist EAE development, the underlying mechanisms of the disease can be deciphered. One factor influencing the response to EAE may lie in the activities of a population of T cells known as the regulatory T cells (Treg). It is proposed that resistant mouse strains have a higher Treg activity and hence lower disease-causing (effector) activity. SJL.B mice, when immunized with the neuroantigen MOG, develop EAE. In contrast, no disease develops when the mice are immunized with MBP. SJL.B mice were therefore immunized with the two antigens. T cells were then sorted by flow cytometry into effector cells expressing high levels of surface CD4 molecule (CD4hi) and Tregs expressing CD4 and CD25 surface molecules. It was shown that susceptible mice had a lower frequency of Tregs than did resistant mice. Conversely, resistant mice had a larger population of specific Tregs that likely inhibited the development of disease. These findings establish the significance of Tregs in the modulation of EAE and also MS, and eventually could allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches to better control the symptoms of MS.

SYNTHESIS OF CATHEPSIN B DEGRADABLE PEPTIDIC DENDRIMERS
Sneha Trichy Kannan
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD

Nanotechnology, specifically polymer-drug conjugates, has shown promise in the development of oral drug-delivery systems to treat cancer. Dendrimers have received significant attention for their higher drug loading capacity and availability of diverse surface groups. An emerging method of cancer treatment uses enzymes upregulated in tumor cells, like cathepsin B. Cathepsin B recognizes and cleaves the tetrapeptide GFLG, previously used in research as a linker binding drugs to an established polymer. This project’s idea was to combine unique properties of dendrimers and enzymatically degradable peptides to create a novel peptidic dendrimer with GFLG and GLFG branches originating from a G0 PAMAM dendrimer core. These dendrimers would selectively kill cancer cells by releasing drugs bound to the peptides only where cathepsin B is concentrated. The dendrimers were successfully synthesized using solution phase peptide synthesis, characterized with NMR and MALDI, and tested in-vitro for branch release with cathepsin B at different time points. Significant decreases in polymer concentrations when incubated with cathepsin B were observed after 4h, suggesting the branches were cleaved, as expected. When GFLG was used as a linker, the number of attachment points on the existing polymer dictated the amount of drug loaded. Using these linkers as the basis for polymers offers scientists control regarding drug loading capacities at the synthesis phase, e.g.—changing core type or number of generations, but still maintains degradation properties. The synthesized polymer is uniquely enzymatically degradable and has significant drug loading/delivery capacity, making it an optimal polymer for use in an oral drug-delivery system.

THE ROLE OF PROTEASOMAL SUBUNNITS IN POLYGLUTAMINE PROTEIN AGGREGATION IN THE NEMATODE C. ELEGANS
Dave Raj Praharaj
Virgil I. Grissom High School, Huntsville, AL

Most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s involve some type of malfunction in terms of protein folding or aggregation. In Huntington’s disease polyglutamine aggregation is an implication of disease progression. It has been hypothesized by scientists that protein aggregation takes place in Huntington’s disease due to the impairment of the proteasome, which catalyzes the degradation of polyubiquinated proteins. In this project, particular areas of the 26S proteasome, composed of a 20S core and a 19S cap, were studied. The areas of the proteasome that were studied were the Rpt3, Rpt4, and Rpt6 subunits, which were all located on the 19S regulatory cap. The effects of these regions on polyglutamine aggregation were studied through numerous RNAi experiments. The model organism that was used to study the effects of the different RNAi experiments was the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Before experimentation began, it was hypothesized that the silencing of one of the subunits on the cap will reduce polyglutamine protein aggregation. The results of this experiment agreed with the hypothesis with statistically significant evidence; individual RNAi of Rpt3, Rpt4, and Rpt6 respectively significantly reduced polyglutamine aggregation.

DOWN-REGULATION OF HTERT SENSITIZES CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF DOCETAXEL IN HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER CELLS
Ashoka Sanjaya Rajendra
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Telomerase allows for the immortalization of cancer cells through telomere maintenance and has been linked to the expression of cell cycle regulating mechanisms. A vital component of this enzyme, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), was therefore the target of this study. In this study, the effects of the suppression of hTERT in combination with the chemotherapy treatment docetaxel on human prostate cancer cells (modeled by PC3) were researched. Docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of prostate cancer is highly cytotoxic, and patients would benefit if lower doses of docetaxel could produce the effects of higher doses. PC3 cells were subjected to combination therapy by down-regulating hTERT expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and then treated with therapeutic or sub-therapeutic concentrations of docetaxel. The cytotoxic and growth inhibiting effects of docetaxel were substantially increased. Notably, 3nM of docetaxel in combination with hTERT down-regulation reduced live cell counts nearly two fold, and worked significantly better than 25 nM therapeutic concentration of docetaxel alone. Further experimentation identified higher caspase (apoptotic proteins) activity as one of the mechanisms responsible for the more effective combination treatment. A Caspase 3/7 assay and fluorescent microscopy results confirmed that in the combination treatment, the expression of caspase activity is far higher than siRNA or docetaxel alone. These results suggested that combination treatment with sub-therapeutic levels of docetaxel in the presence of hTERT specific siRNA produce the same or better effects as higher therapeutic concentrations of docetaxel alone, and this could ultimately benefit prostate cancer patients.

IN SILICO EXPLORATION OF TYPE-C HYPER-METHYLATION
Achutha Narayana Raman
Dover-Sherborn Regional High School, Dover, MA

The mechanism of gene silencing by CpG island methylation is only beginning to be understood. This research project utilizes the current insight to computationally develop a biomarker panel related to cancer detection and diagnosis. The goal of this project was to predict with high accuracy whether CpG islands within promoter regions of human anti-oncogenes were methylation prone or resistant, using computational methods and clinical methylation data. The purpose was to come up with a verifiable methodology to systematically predict the epigenetic state of a genomic region based on the underlying sequence data, helping to systematically identify Type-C (for Cancer) hyper-methylation trends associated with the genes.<br><br> Combining CpG island prediction methods alongside promoter region identification, multiple sequence alignment, and oligonucleotide statistics, the results of the in silico method reported here predict methylation prone as well as methylation resistant genes. The resulting accuracy of greater than 90% compares favorably with published results from clinical data (Feltus et al., 2003).<br><br> DNA methylation is currently being explored as a biomarker to be used in clinical practice for early detection of disease, tumor classification, prediction of disease outcome or recurrence, as well as in understanding aging, although the factors that contribute to methylation susceptibility still remain unknown. The in silico method developed in this project shows some promise in accurately identifying gene markers for minimized hyper-methylation testing to detect the potential onset or development of cancerous tumors.

THE EFFECT OF TURMERIC ON LEARNING IN PARKINSON'S DROSOPHILA
Courtney Anne Onofrio
Hopkinton High School, Hopkinton, MA

Parkinson’s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by its distinctive tremors, affects several hundred thousand Americans. Since studies by the researcher had indicated that turmeric improves the locomotor function of Parkinson’s mutated Drosophila, it was hypothesized that turmeric would have a positive affect on aversive learning ability of the organism. <br><br> <br><br> The GAL4-uas system in Drosophila enables flies to mimic Parkinson’s Disease. The GAL4 driver over-expresses the mutant protein, alpha-synucleinA53T, in tyrosine hydroxolase, which is associated with dopamine cells. This yields dopamine-suppression in Drosophila. Dopamine controls Drosophila response to aversive training. An electric shock stimulus was used with the Pavlovian Olfactory Associative Learning Assay for this experiment. This assay tested Drosophila response to two odors (octanol and MCH) each being accompanied by an electric shock at different intervals. Following the training session, the flies were allowed to choose their preferred odor.<br><br> <br><br> The data indicates a statistical difference (p<0.05) between the Parkinson’s flies that did and did not receive turmeric. In addition, there was a statistical difference (p<0.05) between the treated mutant flies and the control crosses, denoting that turmeric partially rescued the mutant genotype by improving its learning ability. The data also shows that the mutant genotype was unable to learn in response to an aversive stimulus, as previous studies involving other models of dopamine-suppressed flies had indicated. Additionally, the control crosses showed no statistical differences (p>0.05), indicating that turmeric did not enhance the learning ability of wild-type crosses and suggesting that the spice specifically abetted the neurodegeneration involved with this mutation.

INVESTIGATING THE 2D:4D RATIO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATHETIC AND MUSICAL ABILITY
Kaystin Lynn Weisenberger
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

Musical and athletic ability can be determined through a variety of ways, including genetics. The androgen receptors at birth that determine athletic and musical ability also determine the 2D and 4D finger lengths. A study at Wentzville Holt High School surveyed 150 students: 50 control, 50 athletic, and 50 musically-inclined people. Genders were analyzed separately. The right hands of all students were photocopied, finger lengths were measured, and a ratio was calculated between finger lengths. This ratio was then examined for a correlation between what group the students belonged to and their finger lengths. A high 2D:4D ratio typically is linked to musical ability, while a low ratio is linked to athletic ability.

PREVALENCE OF HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS IN YOUNG VERMONT WOMEN: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HPV VACCINE
Caroline Alexandra Weaver
South Burlington High School, 6 Iris Lane, VT

A vaccine for preventing cervical cancer was clinically released to the public in 2006 and includes Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV 16 and 18 are high-risk (hr) virotypes and account for more than 65% of invasive cervical carcinomas. Vaccination has been recommended for all young girls as a means to reduce hrHPV and cervical cancer. To investigate the possible benefit of vaccination, this project determined the clinical and subclinical prevalence of HPV in young women in three at-risk populations in Vermont, including 13-19, 20-24, and 25-29 year olds. Clinical prevalence was determined by reviewing aggregated Pap test results from an academic referral hospital laboratory. Subclinical prevalence was determined from deidentified Pap test samples diagnosed as negative. DNA was extracted, purified, and quantified from negative samples collected from the three age groups. HPV screening was performed with highly sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to detect early infection. Positive samples were then sequenced using dot blot hybridization. Clinical prevalence was 24.0, 24.5, and 18.6 percent and subclinical prevalence was 38.8, 52.1, and 31.5 percent in women ages 13-19, 20-24, and 25-29, respectively. All groups demonstrated infection with high risk virotypes; however, the college-aged group had a wider variety and higher prevalence of hrHPV types. These data indicate infections occur early and longer exposure increases risk, supporting public education promoting protective behavior and current vaccination policy. The presence of hrHPV infections other than HPV 16 and 18 suggests additional vaccines may be useful.

A DEPRESSING DIET? A STUDY OF FOOD ADDITIVES AND CLINICAL DEPRESSION
Nathan Lyne Frantz
Fleming High School, Fleming, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if food additives (specifically MSG, Sodium Benzoate and Yellow #5) influence serotonin levels, thus indicating a potential link to clinical depression. The hypothesis of this experiment is as follows: The presence and ingestion of the food additives MSG, Sodium Benzoate, or Yellow #5 will cause a decrease in serotonin levels and in turn lead to symptoms of clinical depression. Blood was drawn from crayfish and then was quick frozen. After three blood draws, one draw per week for three weeks, the blood was taken to CSU for analysis. The analysis was done using an ELISA test. The raw data was gathered, sorted, and analyzed. The results of this experiment suggest that the ingestion and presence of these food additives does cause a drop in serotonin which in turn could lead to symptoms of clinical depression.

FACTORS AFFECTING BONE STRENGTH DURING DEVELOPMENT IN PERI-PUBERTAL GIRLS OSTEOPOROSIS PREVENTION IN ADOLESCENCE: A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY?
Negin Nematollahi
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Bones provide support, protect organs and give our body shape. Osteoporosis and osteopenia, the weakening of bone strength and density, have been found to be more prevalent within the female population. Past studies have supported the hypothesis that physical activity, maturation, lean body mass, and nutrition have a positive effect on bones; this research quantifies these effects in adolescent girls. A multivariate model was developed to address relationships between physical activity, maturation, lean body mass, and nutrition. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to measure bone volumetric density, macroarchitechtural features (e.g., circumference and cortical thickness) and bone strength (e.g., section modulus). The results indicate that increased physical activity and lean body mass in adolescent girls increases bone strength. Femur results show that 83% of the variance in Strain Strength Index was explained by maturation, body composition, physical exercise & diet. The tibia results show that 75% of the variance in Strain Strength Index was explained by maturation, body composition, physical exercise & diet. The findings support the hypothesis that there is a significant, positive relationship between physical activity and lean body mass and bone strength among peri-pubertal girls.

ASSESSMENT OF THE PHOTIC ABSORBANCE POTENTIAL OF BIX ORELLANA L. (ANNATTO) EXTRACT AND ITS PARAMETERS OF COSMETOLOGY. A NOVEL METHOD IN THE PREVENTION OF SKIN CANCER AMONG UNDERPREVILEGED POPULATIONS
Bruno Fernando Oliveira Buzo
Colegio Koelle, Rio Claro, SP, BRASIL

Cases of skin cancer are exponentially growing in the modern world, especially in Brazil, due to the lack environmental and public prevention campaigns. Also, high prices of sunscreen result in affecting more victims in social-economic disadvantage. <br><br>Previous studies showed the causes of skin cancer cases on low-income population. To address these study cases, a low-cost sunscreen was developed using pharmacognosy methods and models from the active substance of Annatto, which is a common fruit used in Indian body paintings. <br><br>The focus of this research was to improve the method of Bixin (active substance from Annatto) isolation, analyzing it constantly and determining its purity grades by Spectrophotometry techniques. After setting up Microbiological tests, Macroscopic analysis, Vitroscopic tests analyses and another kinds of experiments that involve Physical-Chemical, Analytic and Histo-Pathological analysis, I discovered that Bixin extract is as effective as the other chemical and physical filters, which means that the Bixin extract can replace the usual filters.

THE INCREASING OF SENSITIVITY RATE IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS TYPE 2
Evi Hoxha
Perla High School, Vlore, Vlore, ALBANIA

Diabetes is considered to be one of the most concerning diseases nowadays, this because of its global widespreadness. A frequently neglected consequence but of very serious importance is the increasing of the sensitivity rate to emotions.<br><br>In 4 weeks I tested 40 individuals, from which 20 diabetic ones (8 females-12 males) and 20 nondiabetic (11 females-9 males) aged 45 to 70. The experiments were held in a quiet dark room.The subject took a sit in the assigned table and watched the monitor in front of him showing a 30 minute long film. Before the experiment started, I measured the blood pressure, the pulse and in diabetic individuals also the glycemia. Measurements continued during and after the experiment.<br><br>The measurements I made showed that the alterations of the blood pressure and those of the pulse in diabetic individuals were immediate and stronger. Consequently, the glycemia value decreased to 40 mg/dl. This proves the strong affect of emotions in diabetic indicators.<br><br>The experiment results proved that the former hypothesis is correct and is in accordance to the studies made for this topic. Diabetic individuals are much more sensitive than nondiabetic individuals. Making aware the society of this consequence of diabetes would help first of all the relationships with these individuals and which is most important, it would be helpful in facing this disease. I would be interested in studying sensitivity of diabetics, type 1, which prevails on young ages.

INDIRECT CONTRALATERAL FATIGUE
Samantha Lynn Kunzler
SUCCESS Academy, Cedar City, UT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if a person fatigues one leg will it indirectly affect the force produced with the opposite leg? Using an isokinetic dynamometer machine that measures contraction speed and the force one can exert with a specific leg, I tested both the right and the left leg of nine female test subjects between the ages of twelve and eighteen. To test the maximal force, the test subject sat in a chair with the test leg strapped at the thigh, and the ankle attached to a lever arm. First, I tested the maximal strength one produces with the knee joint from full flexion to full extension with both legs. The test subject was asked to move the test leg from full flexion to full extension using maximal force. This was repeated at least 3 times. The muscles were fatigued in the right leg for a total of four minutes of maximal knee extension at an angular velocity of 85 degrees. Immediately following the right leg fatigue bout, I once again tested each leg to determine maximal force. All of the test subjects performed better on the left leg post test than on the left leg pre test. Therefore by fatiguing one leg it does not indirectly affect the force production one is able to produce with the opposite leg.

A SOLUTION FOR POST-SURGICAL PAIN CONTROL: A NOVEL SUSTAINED-RELEASE LOCAL ANESTHETIC COMPOSED OF HYALURONAN, FIBRINOGEN, AND MARCAINE
David C Evans
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

In the vast majority of surgical procedures, early postoperative pain is controlled by administering a local anesthetic which lasts six to eight hours. Pain models demonstrate that if pain can be eliminated during the first 30 hours post-surgery, healing rates improve and fewer complications develop. I have designed a new local anesthetic that provides a sustained release in excess of 30 hours. This anesthetic includes Hyaluronan and Fibrinogen, two substances found naturally within the body, which are combined with the common local anesthetic, Marcaine.<br><br>Initially, four different combinations of Hyaluronan, Fibrinogen, and Heparin were added to Marcaine to determine the optimal formula for anesthetic release. Marcaine release kinetics were examined by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer assay after the anesthetic was released into simulated body fluid at 4 hour intervals up to 48 hours. At 32 hours, the Hyaluronan/Fibrinogen/Marcaine composite provided sufficient Marcaine concentrations for local anesthesia. Marcaine without added matrix eluted no drug after 4 hours. A cell viability study was then conducted to demonstrate the safety of the composite. Murine dermal fibroblasts were exposed to the composite elute at 4 hour intervals for 32 hours. Live and dead cells were stained and observed under a microscope. Treatment with unbound Marcaine resulted in 100 percent fibroblast death, while my anesthetic composite ensured a higher survival rate. Both the Marcaine release data and the cell viability study demonstrate that I have developed an effective and safe local anesthetic, which has widespread surgical application and the potential to dramatically improve treatment of postoperative pain.

POTENTIAL CANCER CURE USING GARLIC AND VITAMIN C
Jonghyuck Won
Langley High School, McLean, VA

With cancer as one of the most serious diseases for humans, garlic has become popular for its numerous medical effects including its anti-cancer effect. Vitamin C is also famous for its numerous health benefits for humans, and previous studies have shown that vitamin C can extend the life of cancer patients. The purpose of this lab is to test the potential of allicin, vitamin C, and the combination of allicin and vitamin C as future cancer cure treatments. Their inhibition level on cancer cell (PC3 human prostate cancer cell line) growth was tested using proliferation assay. The proliferation of PC3 cells was inhibited strongly by allicin, but not very strongly by vitamin C. The mixture of allicin and vitamin C demonstrated a significant synergistic effect in their inhibition level of PC3 cell growth. In order to test whether my treatments induce PC3 cell death through apoptosis or not, western blot method was used to detect the caspase-3 (one of the main protein indicators of apoptosis) from the treated cell samples. Caspase-3 protein was detected in the samples treated with allicin only and the mixture of allicin and vitamin C. No caspase-3 was detected from the samples treated with vitamin C only. Cells treated with the mixture of allicin and vitamin C generally showed more caspase-3 activation than those treated with allicin only. The western blot result suggests that allicin directly inhibit the growth of PC3 cancer cell by inducing apoptosis while vitamin C seems to have no direct effect on inducing apoptosis. Rather, the weak inhibition effect of vitamin C in the proliferation assay seems to be done through necrosis due to their toxicity to the cells. Also, the western blot result reinforces that there is a synergistic effect in the anti-cancer activity when allicin and vitamin C are combined.

STATINS PREVENT BREAST CANCER GROWTH AND METASTASIS: A THIRD YEAR STUDY
Nayana Ghosh-Choudhury
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Breast cancer in the primary site and its metastasis (migration/invasion) to other organs, including bones, causes enormous pain in patients followed by death. In a clinical study, women taking the cholesterol lowering drug statin had less occurrence of breast cancer suggesting that statin may be beneficial for treating breast cancer patients. In the 1st year study it was found that statins blocked the growth of human breast cancer cells (MDAMB231) in culture and reduced breast tumor growth in nude mice (the student did not handle mice in this 3 year project).In the 2nd year, inhibition of MDAMB231 cells migration/invasion by simvastatin was shown. Also, treatment of MDAMB231 cells with simvastatin inhibited the activity of Akt.<br><br>This year, the mechanism for simvastatin-mediated inhibition of breast tumor formation and metastasis was investigated. Analysis of tumors from simvastatin-treated mice showed (a) decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein BclXL, (b) increase in the tumor suppressor PTEN and (c) reduction in the pro-tumorigenic and metastatic protein CD44. In MDAMB231 cells in vitro, simvastatin inhibited the transcriptional activity of the anti-apoptotic NF B, resulting in prevention of BclXL and CD44 expression. Simvastatin increased the expression of PTEN protein by upregulating its transcription. PTEN expression in MDAMB231 blocked growth and migration/invasion of these cells. Simvastatin treatment significantly prevented the bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. Together, these results demonstrate that simvastatin inhibits growth-promoting proteins and increases pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor proteins to slow the growth and migration of the breast cancer cells. Furthermore, these data provide the first evidence for the beneficial effect of simvastatin on breast cancer bone metastasis. Therefore, the results from this year's study show the potential for the clinical use of simvastatin in treating breast cancer patients.

WHITE COATS: BOON OR BANE?
Ariel Lynne Schroeder
Saint Joseph High School, Natrona Heights, PA

In an effort to decrease nosocomial infection, the UK has instituted a policy banning white coats and apparel beneath the elbow for health care workers. Although clothing can become colonized with bacteria, there is no evidence that clothing is a vector for infection. There is also no evidence that white coats are more contaminated than other clothing worn by health care providers. This study compared bacterial colony counts of cuffs and lapels of control clothing vs. apparel of non-coat wearing clinicians, as well as white coats and the clothing worn under the white coats (n=80 for each of the of three groups). Bacterial typing and presence of pathogens was also noted. Non-coat wearers' clothing actually had as much or more bacterial contamination than either control clothing or white coats. The presence of pathogens was no different between the groups. There was also no statistical difference of bacterial contamination or presence of pathogens based upon sleeve length or length of time white coat was worn. The UK "bare below the elbow" policy and the expense of enforcing it are NOT justified by the results of this study.

FREQUENCIES OF THE PLAT GENE IN DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
Dane Arthur Rasmussen
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there was a difference in gene frequencies for the PLAT Alu insertion between Caucasians and Native Americans in the Aberdeen area. According to a previous study, a person who was homozygous for the Alu insertion had a two-fold risk of heart attack compared to those who did not have the Alu insertion (Cancer Weekly Plus, 1997). Native Americans have the highest death rate for heart attack among all U.S. races. It is thought that the reason for this high death rate is from environmental sources such as smoking and hypertension (CDC, 2008). The results of this project may also suggest a genetic reason for this high death rate.<br><br> To test for gene frequencies, buccal cells were taken from volunteers by having them swish Gatorade in their mouths. DNA was then extracted from these cells by digesting the buccal cells in lysis buffer and then suspended in alcohol. The DNA was then ran through PCR, amplifying the target sequence. Results of the PCR were analyzed by gel electrophoresis.<br><br> The results showed that there was a difference in gene frequency between the two races. The Native Americans had a higher frequency of heterozygotes than the Caucasians. This suggests that the Native American population has a higher chance of producing homozygotes. Native Americans are therefore more prone to heart attacks suggesting that the reason for the Native Americans' high death rate due to heart attack may be caused both by genetic and environmental factors.

PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COLLIODAL NANO-SILICA AND TNMPP
Christine Tchounwou
Madison Central High School, Madison, MS

Singlet Oxygen is known to be very reactive and chemically unstable, yet it is one of the most important metabolities that initiate reduction and oxidation under physiological conditions. The production of singlet oxygen was the main focus of the research. The singlet oxygen hoped to be produced was derived from Colloidal nano-silica with the combining of 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin tetra (p-toluenesulfonate) (TNMPP). 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis-(4-sulfonatopheny)-21,23H-porphyrin (TSPP) was also used as a trial to see at which pH, that the peak of absorbance would occur. Before this was achieved, colloidal nanosilica was prepared using the sol-gel process. In this process Na2Si03 solution was used as the precursor for the Collodial nanosilica. 10% H2S04 and 1M NaOH were the pH adjust agents (from pH 2 to pH 8). Na2Si03 solution was kept in a low temperature so that the reaction rate could be slow and the colloidal solution could be more stable. After preparing the NA2Si03 solution, it was placed in a refrigerator overnight. Along with the preparation of Na2Si03, the absorbance of TNMPP was calculatead at different pHs using a Ultra Violet spectrophotometer.

CORRELATION BETWEEN CYTOPLASMIC VACUOLES AND ATAXIN-1 NUCLEAR INCLUSIONS IN PURKINJE CELLS IN SCA1
Eshan Safaya
William B. Murrah High, Jackson, MS

Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat within the disease protein ataxin-1. The over-expression of this mutated protein leads to the development of cytoplasmic vacuoles within Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum in both human patients and transgenic mice with SCA1. It’s not known if these vacuoles are beneficial or toxic to Purkinje cells. Earlier, we observed that vacuoles contain glial proteins S100B and vimentin. The aim of this study was to examine the functional relevance of these vacuoles, and if vacuole development has any correlation with the formation of intranuclear inclusions of ataxin-1. Cerebellar tissue sections of 10 wks old SCA1 homozygous transgenic was processed and double immunostained for S100B to visualize vacuoles and for ubiquitin to identify ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions. The total number of Purkinje cells containing vacuoles or nuclear inclusions, or both vacuoles and inclusion were counted. Interestingly, about 90% of the cells with inclusions did not contain vacuoles and same percentage of cells with vacuoles had no inclusions. Further analysis of the pre-symptomatic mice showed that cells with vacuoles exhibited dendritic spine abnormalities as assessed by immunostaining of Purkinje cell marker proteins or by specialized silver staining technique. These data suggest that there exists an inverse correlation between vacuole development and intranuclear inclusion formation in SCA1 Purkinje cells. Since aggregation of ataxin-1 could be a protective mechanism, it’s possible that vacuoles are formed in cells that contain more soluble form of ataxin-1.

CRACKING CANCER WITH CRK: DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF SHRNA_CRK IN THE METASTATIC & CELLULAR FUNCTIONING OF MDA-MB-231 BREAST ADENOCARCINOMA.
Abicumaran Uthamacumaran
Marymount Academy, Montreal, QC, Quebec, CANADA

The purpose of the project was to determine the effects of RNA interference mediated Crk adaptor proteins’ knockdown in the MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Crk proteins are found in all cells, however, they are over-expressed in breast tumour cells according to previous studies. The hypothesis was that the knockdown of the Crk proteins in the cells will significantly reduce its cellular functions such as matrix-binding and morphogenesis. It will reduce certain potential metastatic properties of the cells as well.<br><br> The cells were divided into a control and experimental group. The experimental group consists of the cells that were obtained from the shRNA constructs in which Crk proteins were silenced through vector hybridization assessed by immunoblotting. Other stages include the measuring of the cells' efficiency in matrix-binding through adhesion assays on matrices, immunofluorescence staining of the cells to study the morphological changes in the cytoskeleton of the cells after Crk knockdown and the changes in the levels of phospho-tyrosine after shRNA-Crk in the cells.<br><br> In conclusion, the results were extremely significant and show that cell adhesion can decrease up to 50% on collagen substrate within only a 60 minute time interval in the experimental cells. Levels of p-CAS and p-FAK reduced in the shRNA-Crk cells. The lack of support from the cell-surface membrane in the shRNA-Crk cells resulted in the reduction of its toxicity as well. This innovative study into effects of CRK knockdown in cancer cells shows potential for anti-metastatic therapeutics and effective breast cancer treatments.

POEMS DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS
Alexandra del Carmen Zengotita-Toro
Rafael Irizarry Rivera School, Peñuelas, PUERTO RICO

The investigator was interested on her father’s disease called POEMS syndrome. Since this disease is very difficult to diagnose, the question was: Why is it so difficult for doctors to diagnose POEMS syndrome? The hypothesis considered was patients of this disease understand the symptoms that the body develops diagnosing POEMS syndrome would be less complicated and there would be a faster and more effective treatment. To prove the hypothesis the investigator searched for information about the topic on different Internet medical websites. An interview was made to the investigator's father who suffers this disease, to auscultate on the symptoms, causes and treatments. After analyzing the data it was discovered that the POEMS syndrome is very degenerative, because attacks the patient’s immunologic system debilitating it. This syndrome affects men more than women. This syndrome causes alterations on different organs. The acronym POEMS stands for: Polineuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinipathy, protein M monoclonal and Skin change. This disease is so difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are regularly mistaken for other diseases. The most common symptom of the disease is a chronic peripheral Polineuropathy associated to an Osteoesclerotic mieloma. Patients show symptoms such as shivers, sensation of spikes at distal level and progressive weakness of the extremities. It's concluded that it's very important for the patient to be aware of the symptoms his or her body develops; so that a good diagnosis of the disease can be done and appropriate treatment can be given to achieve a good quality of life.

THE AGING OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS
Lia D'Abate
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, CANADA

Cardiovascular disease is very prevalent in North America, primarily affecting an elderly demographic. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), deriving from human bone marrow, are cells that have shown the most promise in terms of their plasticity and differentiation capacity to help repair resulting myocardial damage. Consequently, the creation of a universal immune-tolerant stem cell donor line has been proposed to allow for the mainstream application of stem cell therapy. Defining age by passage number and donor age, this study was aimed at determining the effect of age on the proliferation of MSCs, senescence through ß-galactosidase staining, cell cycle and apoptosis fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and cell differentiation into adipocytes and osteocytes. Cells from two different strains of rats were used: Sprague Dawley (SD) and Lewis (LW). <br><br>The results obtained did not demonstrate any significant difference between strain and biological age of the donor. Significant results (p<0.05, t-Test), however, were observed between higher and lower passages. In the proliferative study, cells at higher passages consistently had a higher proliferation rate than those at lower passages. In the ß-galactosidase assay, young LW cells proved to senesce less and the apoptosis study revealed the percentage of apoptotic old LW cells was far lower in higher passages. It can thus be speculated that cells may have undergone genetic alterations with increased passages. This has tremendous applications in the context of the universal stem cell donor line because it sets the standard for optimal in vitro manipulation of MSCs to render stem cell therapy more effective.

COMPARING SURVIVAL OF PUMA-DEFICIENT & WILDTYPE MSCS TO APOPTOTIC STIMULI FOR AUGMENTED REGENERATION
Ratna Varma
A. B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

In this project, a novel research has been performed to determine the conditions necessary for a successful stem cell transplant using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) which are being considered for the treatment of spinal cord and brain injuries. Stem cells tend to die (undergo apoptosis) upon transplantation into the harsh environment of diseased or injured tissue, thereby limiting success of stem cell based therapies. A major pro-apoptotic (death causing) protein PUMA is activated in stem cells post transplantation, in response to a number of cell death stimuli including oxidative stress, protein misfolding and anoxia (oxygen deprivation). In this project, apoptotic rates of PUMA-proficient and PUMA-deficient MSCs derived from mice bone marrow were investigated. Above MSC cultures were incubated for varying time periods under normoxia and anoxia; presence and absence of glucose; and exposure to three different types of apoptotic stimuli CPT, TBH and TUN. Extent of apoptosis was then assessed by examining cell/nuclear morphology after Hoechst staining. The following conclusions are made: i) Apoptosis increases with incubation time, deprivation of oxygen, deficiency of glucose and presence of apoptotic stimuli, ii) Anoxia and TBH are strong inducers of apoptosis, iii) Lack of glucose induces apoptosis but not substantially, iv) PUMA-deficient MSCs are more resistant to apoptosis than PUMA-proficient MSCs, under all the circumstances stated in i). Based on this novel study, measures can now be undertaken to remove the pro-apoptotic PUMA gene before transplant of MSCs thereby making stem cell transplants more successful in treating critical spinal cord and brain injuries.

REAL TIME RADIATION DOSE DEVIATIONS NOT CONFIGURED BY A BRACHYTHERAPY TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM USED IN CANCER TREATMENT
Romita Sur
Hillfield-Strathallan College, Hamilton, ON, CANADA

In bronchogenic carcinoma with obstructed lumen, a hollow Teflon catheter with a tungsten fluoroscopic marker* at the catheter tip maybe partially inserted into the tumour to radiate the tumor from the catheter tip. A computerised treatment-planning-system (TPS) generates a plan for the patient’s treatment based on dose prescription. An afterloader is a computerised brachytherapy unit that sends a pellet of Iridium-192 into a hollow catheter for treatment, causing tumor shrinkage so that subsequent insertions are done completely through tumor lumen.<br><br>This study compared the relative doses generated by a point-source delivering a 2Gy at 1cm radiation dose at the tip of a treatment catheter by a TPS to that generated by an autoradiograph obtained by passing a point-source inside a Teflon treatment catheter* on a Radiochromic film in real time. An optical-scanner scanned the autoradiograph. Medical Physics in-house optical-density-to-dose-conversion program recorded the relative dose. Results were graphed and compared to the TPS output.<br><br>In real time, there was significant alteration of isodose curves at the catheter tip resulting in lower radiation doses at prescription point. At the prescription points around the source, compared to the TPS, the autoradiograph showed 18-20% less dose. The TPS did not show this dose reduction which was caused by the tungsten fluoroscopic marker. In 20%patients with bronchogenic carcinoma where radiation dose is delivered from catheter tip, parts of tumor can receive 18-20% less dose causing tumor underdosage. <br><br>Use of plastic radio-opaque-marker tipped catheters is recommended in such cases for more effective treatment.<br><br>*supplied by manufacturer<br><br>

UNDERSTANDING PSORIASIS AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL -HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE EFFICIENT TREATMENTS FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES?
Cecilie Nohr Pedersen
Rodkilde Gymnasium, Vejle, DENMARK

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease which causes serious deterioration of the life quality. <br><br>High levels of cytokine IL-22 – likely caused by the lack of the natural inhibitor, IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) - is presumed to be one of the etiological factors for psoriasis. Cytokines IL-1 and IL-4, known as strong T-cell activators, might activate the T-cells and down-regulate IL-22BP - most likely mediated through a co-stimulatory signal by CD28/CD3.<br><br>The aim is to 1) identify and characterize antibodies against IL-22BP to follow and quantitate this protein and 2) identify the factors responsible for the regulation of IL-22BP in T-cells.<br><br>To characterize the antibody specificity and to identify antibodies which can be used for flowcytometry, non-denatured proteins from human mononuclear cells were up-concentrated in ELISA plates and analysed by Western blotting.

DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI-HIV TEST KIT BY USING IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHIC STRIP TEST TECHNIQUE
Chakkrit Jaidee
Maeprikwitraya School, Maeprik, Lampang, THAILAND

As the number of HIV infected patients has been alarmingly increasing and no cure for the disease is available at present. Mainly, the ability of the virus to mutate itself rapidly is the basis of the problem in treatment and prevention. Currently, the most effective treatment programme is continuous treatment using combination of antiretrovirals to prevent the viral mutation as well as improve quality and prolong life of the patients. Discontinuous of the treatment could easily lead to viral resistance to drugs and life threatening. Routine monitoring of drug level in patient body fluid is thus considered a necessary procedure in order to optimize the long term treatment. <br><br>Nevirapine (NVP), 11-cyclopropyl-5,11-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido-[3,2-b:2_,3_-e], is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) which is widely used as a part of highly active antiretroviral therapy for the HIV/AIDS treatment. In addition, NVP is also used as a single dose prophylactic intervention during labor for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods that are mainly used to measure the antiretroviral plasma concentrations are not commonly available in rural areas and require expensive equipments and skillful technicians. To alleviate the problem, a simple, cheap and reliable test kit is developed in this study based on immunochromatograhic (IC) strip test technique.<br><br>Initially, an equal volume of 0.375 mM HAuCl4 and 0.0375% (w/v) sodium citrate was found to be the optimal ratio for the formation of gold particles which is used for conjugation with 400 µg/ml anti-NPV antibody. The colloidal gold particles conjugated with rabbit anti-NPV were subsequently used for the production of an IC strip for detection of NPV in human plasma. Negative test study revealed no cross reactivity between anti-NPV and non- NPV treated human plasma. Preliminary positive test study showed that sentivity of the developed test kit NPV is yet to be improved as a faint band appeared at the test line when strip was merged in 1 ug/ml concentration.

TROPHIC AND PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF SHH ON DOPAMINERGIC AND CHOLINERGIC NEURONS IN THE NIGROSTRIATAL PATHWAY
Can Hu
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates many aspects of morphogenesis, including cell proliferation and differentiation in embryonic tissues. Recently Shh was found to be expressed in the midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons of adult rodents. The nigrostriatal pathway, in which DA neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain project axons into the cholinergic neurons in the striatum, plays an important role in modulating the functions of the basal ganglia circuit and is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. To investigate the effect of Shh on the postnatal midbrain and striatum, the change of the expression of specific markers in the DA neurons of the midbrain and the cholinergic neurons of the striatum was examined by ablating the expression of Shh in the midbrain DA neurons. It was found that Shh ablation led to the decrease in the expression of GDNF (a trophic factor that promotes the survival of DA neurons) in the cholinergic neurons of the striatum, which may cause the decrease of dopamine in the midbrain DA neurons. It was also found that Shh ablation resulted in the decrease of cholinergic markers in the striatum, and dopaminergic markers in the midbrain. These results showed that dopamine and acetylcholine neural markers were downregulated after Shh ablation in midbrain DA neurons. This finding suggests a bidirectional trophic loop in which Shh produced in DA neurons acts on the striatum to maintain cholinergic neurons, which in return produce GDNF to maintain midbrain DA neurons. The maintenance of DA neurons prevents from Parkinson’s disease.

THE PREVENTION OF DNA VACCINE ENCODING THE MAJOR COCKROACH ALLERGEN BLA G 1 ON THE ALLERGIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION
Yixuan Zhou
White Station High School, Memphis, TN

Background: Cockroaches produce potent allergens that are an important cause of asthma, the Bla g 1 allergen from the German cockroach is responsible for the primary U.S. exposure. We present a new treatment using Bla g 1 DNA vaccine to evaluate its protective efficacy in mouse model. <br><br>Methods: Mice were received three injections of DNA vaccine following initial sensitization with two priming doses of rBlag 1 and then challenged by nebulized rBla g 1. <br><br>Results: Bla g 1 vaccine markedly reduced the total inflammatory cell infiltrate and eosinophilia and the TH2 pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in response to inhaled rBla g 1 challenge. Furthermore, DNA vaccine significantly suppressed allergen-induced inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs and Bla g 1 specific IgE in serum. The suppression of experimental asthma by Bla g 1 vaccine was associated with the production of immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 and inhibition of TH2 pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5. <br><br>Conclusion: Results demonstrate that the immune response of hypersensitized responders can be modulated by Bla g 1vaccination, preventing airway disease upon re-exposure to allergen.

MAPPING THE COXSACKIE AND ADENOVIRUS RECEPTOR IN THE MOUSE BRAIN FOR PARKINSON DISEASE THERAPY
Anya Michelle Glandon
Mountain Brook High School, Birmingham, AL

Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder affecting 3% of the population over 65 years of age. A pathological hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain involved in movement. Dopamine replacement therapy has been used for the past 50 years and continues to be the basis of modern treatment, but there remains much room for improvement. Currently researchers are interested in studying whether therapy delivered via a viral vector can slow or reverse the progression of illness. Adenoviruses are one such vector being studied as possible gene therapy delivery vehicles for PD. The protein coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), is used by adenovirus to enter cells in order to infect, or in the case of a viral vector, in order to deliver their therapeutic payload. To study whether adenovirus can be used as therapy in PD, I assessed the expression of CAR in the neurons involved the disease process. Both normal and CAR transgenic fixed mouse brains were sectioned and stained using either fluorescent or colorimetric assays. Tissue was then analyzed by microscopy in order to map the location of CAR on cells in both the transgenic and non-transgenic mouse brain. We found that CAR was not prevalent on the cell surfaces of the non-transgenic mouse brain and this limited the ability of adenovirus to infect those cells. These results will help direct scientists towards ways of making adenovirus a more effective gene therapy for PD.

THE EXPRESSION OF MICRORNAS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEUKEMIA
Mengyi Xu
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

This study seeks to examine the role of miR-221 and miR-222 in the leukemogenesis of AML, the most common acute leukemia in adults. MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are now recognized as small RNA molecules that act as major regulators of coding genes in the human genome. From the systematic miRNA profiling analysis of 435 mammalian miRNAs in 18 ALL, 54 AML, and 3 control samples, 27 miRNAs expressed differently between ALL and AML. The expressions of these 27 miRNAs in the controls are largely similar to those in the AML samples, except for miR-221, miR-222, miR-130a and let-7e. Therefore, in this study miR-221 and miR-222 are chosen as the focus for their unique expression pattern and juxtaposition in the human genome.<br><br>The miR-221 and miR-222 fragments are first amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. The fragments are digested and introduced into MSCV, which is then transformed into E.Coli for amplification. The constructs are confirmed both by comparing their band-sizes and blasting their sequences against human genome reference sequences, which matched 100%. The plasmids are transfected into HEK 293T cells to detect the expressions of miR-221/miR-222 in vivo. The GFP expression in cells represents the expression of miR-221/miR-222.<br><br>The mechanisms of these miRNAs need to be further studied. The present study is a first step into the identification of the contribution of miR-221 and miR-222 to cell growth and differentiation. Further investigation of their roles may lead to novel approaches for the categorization, diagnosis, and treatment of AML and possibly human cancers in general.

ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITY OF SCUTELLARIA ON AKT/PKB SIGNALING
Johnny Fells
Northside High School, Warner Robins, GA

Tests have been done to inhibit Akt/PKB which has been proven to allow cancer cell proliferation, survival capacity, and movement. By reducing the pathways which the cell signals can pass, the cancer cells begin to die. The problem for the project was to find which plant extract of Scutellaria barbata and Scutellaria ocmulgee would inhibit Akt/PKB the most. It was expected that S. barbata leaf extracts would inhibited the activation of Akt/PKB the most. F-98 rat glioma cells were subcultured with DMEM/F12 media and incubated in CO2 Water Jacket Incubator. The cells were treated two concentrations of S. barbata and S. ocmulgee leaf extracts while two wells were left as controls. Protein purification was conducted through cell lysis and immunoprecipitation and a Bradford Assay was conducted. The samples were processed through SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: one gel was used for a stained analysis; one gel was transferred for a Western blot analysis. The blot was washed with its primary and antibodies and image was taken. The 600µg/mL S. ocmulgee the least amount of phosphorylated Akt. The conclusion was that S. ocmulgee was the most effective inhibitor for Akt/PKB on F-98 rat glioma cells and rejecting the hypothesis.

In milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal), the bile is considered waste, but folkloric beliefs claim that it has medicinal applications. This study aims to determine the antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties of the bile. The protein in the bile, believed to be the bioactive constituents, were examined and characterized.<br><br>The antibacterial property of milkfish bile against Vibrio harveyi strains, Proteus vulgaris, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 73164), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25923) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25922) was conducted on agar cup-well diffusion assay. Antioxidant property was evaluated by free radical DPPH scavenging assay; toxicity by Brine Shrimp assay; cytotoxic activity by MTT assays; protein content by Bradford Protein and Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assays, and characterization of protein content by SDS-PAGE.<br><br>The bile potently inhibited the growth of V. harveyi, 3 Vibrio sp. and P. aeruginosa while inactive against other test microbes. Milkfish bile demonstrated 86.05 % inhibition against DPPH comparable to 100 % inhibition induced by Gallic acid. Fifty percent mortality at 10µl/ml was observed with the Brine Shrimp assay. The MTT assay revealed 0.1620 % IC50 and 0.1640 % IC50 potently inhibit proliferation of human colon and lung carcinomas, respectively. Protein content and bands were linearly comparable to Bovine Serum Albumin of 1.925µl/well in every 5 µg/well of bile and two protein bands (MW: 82.44 and 68.17) were obtained, respectively.<br><br>Milkfish bile is part of the physicochemical defense mechanism of the fish, and a promising source of protein compounds for antibacterial, chemotherapy, and chemoprevention.

WHEN GROWN TOGETHER, DO HUCB CELLS AID NEURON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT?
Joshua Wayne Hammer
Zephyrhills High School, Zephyrhills, FL

The brain is composed of billions of neural cells linked together by neurites. Many times through accidents, these cells become damaged and do not repair. It is believed however that neurons can be stimulated by growing them with different white blood cells. It is hypothesized that HUCB cells when grown with neurons will cause greater and faster neuron development than any of the other cell types.<br><br>To complete the experiment, 10 well plates were set up with each well containing one of the five conditions; neurons only, neurons plus HUCB, neurons plus T-cells, neurons plus CD4+ cells, and neurons plus CD8+ cells. After one week of incubation an FDA/PI test was conducted using the two day process of fixing and administrating two chemicals. Through florescence imaging you can see which cells were alive. A Map2 analysis was conducted which caused neurites to show up on a microscope to be counted. <br><br>The experiment consisted of five trials, but the data was inconsistent so that only two trials could be used. In the two salvaged runs, the only significant data was in the comparison between the number of live cells and neurite growth. As the number of live cells decreased, neurite growth, or neural activity increased. In the future this research will lead to the development of drugs that can completely reverse the affects of stroke.

DOES CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA HAVE AN EFFECT ON ALZHEIMER’S AMYLOID-BETA PATHOLOGY IN THE BRAIN?
Jasmine Samaiya Roberts
Paul R. Wharton High School, Tampa, FL

Introduction: This experiment investigates the relationship between Alzheimer’s Amyloid-Beta (AB) and Hyperglycemia (diabetes) pathology in three brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and frontal cortex). The purpose of this experiment is to determine if hyperglycemia affects the level of amyloid-Bplaques in Alzheimer’s patients. In the US, over 5 million Americans suffer with Alzheimer’s disease. The significance of developing a new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) will improve the quality of life for Alzheimer’s victims, save taxpayers millions of dollars in healthcare costs, increase the survival rate and improve the recovery for those that do survive.<br><br>Method: This experiment utilized the brain tissue of four groups of mice: (1)AD + Diabetes (transgenic Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)), (2)AD (transgenic APP), (3)Diabetes (non-transgenic), and (4)normal (non-transgenic). This investigation consists of five experiments and the making of 100+ slides with brain tissue on them. The procedures for this experiment includes (1)sectioning the brain by using a microtone, (2)staining (AB immunohistochemistry and Congo Red stains) and mounting of the brain sections, (3)dehydrating the tissue on the slides, (4)imaging, and (5)image analysis (ANOVA and T-Test). <br><br>Results: The data of this experiment shows an increasing trend of AB pathology in mice with AD + Diabetes verses mice with just Alzheimer’s.<br><br>Conclusion: The results of this experiment supported the researcher’s hypothesis and revealed that mice with AD plus Diabetes have a greater amount of AB plaque pathology in the brain. This investigation proves that diabetes is a risk factor that increases AD pathology, which means there can be more memory loss.

ADENOSINE 2B RECEPTOR: A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME
Zinan Zhang
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

The major goal of my project is to demonstrate that adenosine 2b receptor (A2bAR) is a key modulator of stool water content and colonic motility, abnormalities of which underlie symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The findings of my research will be a proof-of-principle to formulate treatment strategies for diarrhea-predominant IBS, a debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide.<br><br> Experimentation was performed on A2bAR-/- and A2bAR+/+ (WT) mice of the C57BL/6 strain. The colons of some mice were dissected and photographed. The stool was also collected. It was determined that A2bAR-/- mice have delayed colonic emptying and increased stool retention. A2bAR-/- mice also demonstrated significantly reduced water content in the stool. In addition, by feeding WT mice with an A2bAR antagonist, ATL-801, for two weeks and comparing these mice with WT mice on a control diet, showed that the antagonist diet caused WT mice to exhibit similar stool characteristics of A2bAR-/- mice. <br><br> Contraction and relaxation responses were determined using isometric muscle recording with electric field stimulation. A2bAR-/- mice displayed significantly higher amplitudes and decreased relaxation responses in comparison to WT mice. This abnormality in A2bAR-/- mice can be explained by the influence of A2bAR on nitric oxide firing in neurons. Lastly, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), an A2bAR agonist, demonstrated in an electrophysiological study that A2bAR-/- mice have decreased chloride secretion, and as a result less water content in stool. <br><br> These results demonstrate that blocking A2BAR is a form of treatment for the diarrhea aspect of IBS.

THE NEURONAL AND NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF S-NITROSOGLUTATHIONE AND SIMVASTATIN ON A CONTROLLED CORTICAL IMPACT MODEL
Taylor Perkins Trew
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the neurological and neuronal effects of various combinations of Simvastatin and S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) on traumatic brain injuries. It is predicted that since statins are lipid lowering drugs, and S-Nitrosoglutathione reduces the impact of free radicals on systems of the body, that when paired together, TBI will be much less detrimental. An animal model, prepared by the QS, was used in this study. Simvastatin and GSNO were administered by the surgical team two hours after surgery, and then once every twenty-four hours for fourteen days. This study concentrated on the recovery of the animals and the analysis of the brain tissue. To test the recovery of the animals both a beam walk test and a Rotarod test were used. Tissue staining using Eosin and Haematoxylin stains was then conducted to show the damage caused by the cortical impact in the tissue fourteen days after surgery. The results from each of the tests showed that the recovery of the animals that were administered with the GSNO, as well as the animals treated with the Simvastatin, recovered almost completely after fourteen days. The tissue staining showed the significant reduction in damage of the tissue from the variations of medicines administered compared to the tissue from the control group (SHAM). The Rotarod testing showed that the animals treated with the combination drug recovered the quickest, proving the hypothesis. A two tailed t-test was used to verify the statistical significance of the data found.

NEURAL STEM CELL MIGRATION AND REMYELINATION IN RESPONSE TO CHEMOKINES
Julianne Marie Golinski
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder resulting in demyelinating lesions within the nervous system. This experiment was conducted to study the possibility for repair of these lesions by attracting neural stem cells (NSCs) to the lesioned areas using chemokines, proteins known to affect migration of NSCs. Once at the lesion, NSCs would then be capable of remyelinating the lesions, thus restoring nerve function. A study of NSC migration in response to chemokines was conducted. It was hypothesized that the chemokines SDF-1 and Fractalkine would promote NSC migration and remyelination. NSCs were mixed with low melting point agarose, placed on a coverslip, submerged in growth media containing the specific chemokine, incubated for forty-eight hours, and stained with GFAP, an antibody that labels astrocytes. Measurement analysis showed that, compared to the control, SDF-1 and Fractalkine promote neural stem cell migration. Migration and remyelination was further tested in sliced cultures, thin living slices of rat brain. The slices were demyelinated with lysophosphatidylcholine, treated with either chemokine for seventy-two hours, fixed, and stained for Myelin Basic Protein. SDF-1 and Fractalkine were both found to promote the remyelination of lesioned areas. Fractalkine promotes remyelination but to a lesser extent than SDF-1. The results of this study show that in a sliced culture and in a drop assay SDF-1 and Fractalkine promote NSC migration and remyelination. This study reveals that SDF-1 and Fractalkine treatment could be used to promote the repair of nervous system damage caused by Multiple Sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and other diseases of the nervous system.

EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND POROSITY ON THE STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS OF A TRANSTIBIAL PROSTHETIC PYLON
Andrew David Mullen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to create an inexpensive, available transtibial prosthetic leg as might be used by U.S. Soldiers and citizens from low-income countries such as India who lost a leg and cannot afford to buy a commercial prosthetic leg. To execute this experiment, I researched transtibial prostheses, purchased several inexpensive pipes and dowels of aluminum, PVC, and wood. Then, I had the specimens cut into a length of twenty inches using a power saw. I researched the relationship of hole size to porosity and selected a hole diameter of three-eighths of an inch to test porosity. I had the determined hole size drilled into the selected specimens with a drill press. Under the supervision of an engineer, I placed a specimen without holes into the Materials Test System to be compressed. I tested the specimen until I reached the target load of 250 pounds and stored the data on a computer for plotting. I repeated the steps involving the loading for other specimens without holes and then for the specimens with holes. The tests were repeated for the other materials and under a cyclic load at 1 cycle per second. I measured the effects of compression and porosity on the strength and stiffness of the pylons. Aluminum was by far the stiffest and strongest, but it was the most expensive and the heaviest, followed by wood and then PVC. Porosity did not cause the pylons to fail, but it did halve the stiffness.

THE ABILITY OF NEONATAL RAT LUNGS TO RECOVER AFTER EXPOSURE TO HYPEROXIA
Abhinav S Totapally
Gulliver Preparatory School, Miami, FL

Hyperoxia can cause serious damage to cells due to the formation of free radicals. Free radicals destroy cellular structures and membranes in lung alveoli causing chronic lung disease. In the investigator's previous study, hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide) did not improve alveolar area after damage from hyperoxia. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether neonatal rat lungs would recover in room air after being exposed to hyperoxic conditions. <br><br> Four groups of neonatal rats were used during the experiment: 8 day air, 4 day air, 4 day hyperoxia, and 4 day hyperoxia/4 day air (the recovery group). Five pups were studied in each group. Only the slides of the tissue were given to the investigator for observation and measurement. The alveolar area from lung tissue slides was measured using a microscope and an image analyzer. The data were analyzed using ANOVA followed by multiple comparison tests (Tukey-Kramer and Bonferroni Test). <br><br> The alveolar area significantly increased in the recovery group (1524 ± 602 µ2) compared to the eight day air group (652 ± 72 µ2; p<0.05). The results indicated that lung injury continued to worsen during exposure to air after hyperoxic conditions. One possible explanation for continued lung injury after cessation of exposure to hyperoxia is persistence of inflammation from free radical generation. The conclusion was that lung damage continues even after cessation of exposure to hyperoxic conditions which may lead to development of chronic lung disease. Limitations of the study include few subjects and evaluating only the area of alveoli.

NETS SNARE BACTERIA: HOW NEUTROPHILS SET THE TRAP FOR PNEUMOCOCCI
Winston Branscomb Joe
The Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

Strep pneumoniae kills millions each year (4). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) destroy pneumococci by phagocytosis or by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). PMNs make NETs when stimuli cause them to release cellular material. The released DNA serves as the NET’s framework, with immune proteins (lactoferrin, defensins) adhering to it. Bacteria are trapped and killed by these proteins. This study was designed to determine (i) if different strains (D39, JY182) vary in ability to induce NETs from PMNs; (ii) if the different NETs formed vary in their trapping or killing; and (iii) the role of defensins in this process. <br><br> Results showed that D39 weakly induced PMNs to form NETs, and these NETs trapped few bacteria. In contrast, JY182, lacking surface protein PspA, strongly induced NETs and trapping. Additionally, D39 was susceptible to NETs if PMNs were chemically stimulated, but more JY182 were trapped by NETS from both preinduced and natural PMNs. This suggests that the capsule bearing PspA may not protect against NETS—it may just allow bacteria to survive without strongly inducing NETs.<br><br> NET components were assessed by performing killing in the presence of alpha defensin. Defensin killing was less effective (preliminary) than lactoferrin (4,8).<br><br> Conclusions: (a) D39 weakly induces NETs and thus may persist in the host without recognition--while the “same” bacterium with no surface PspA does induce NETs and may be more readily eliminated; and (b) NET protection against bacteria is probably multifactorial, with bacterial surface proteins and PMN-derived peptides such as defensins involved in complex ways.

THE DISSOLUTION OF VARIOUS OTC MEDICINES UNDER DIFFERENT PHYSIOLOGICAL PH CONDITIONS
Marisha N. Wickremsinhe
Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, Indianapolis, IN

The effectiveness of a medicine taken orally depends on its dissolution within the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The pH of the GI tract is affected by many factors including the presence or absence of food, antacids, etc., and can range in pH from approximately 1 to 8 (from stomach to duodenum). This study was designed to evaluate the dissolution of common over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements at pH 2, 4, 6, and 8. Comparisons were also made between name-brand and generic brands as well as between different formulations of the same medicine (tablets versus caplets). A total of 27 medicines were tested. Tylenol, Advil, Benadryl, Centrum Silver, and Vitamin D showed similar dissolution times across all four pH conditions while One-A-Day Teen Advantage, Vitamin C, One-A-Day Women’s, Fish Oil Concentrate, Flintstone Gummies and RejuCalcium did not dissolve under any pH condition within 30 minutes (the latter two did not dissolve even after 2 hours). Actifed showed a three-fold difference in dissolution time between pH 2 and pH 8 while Vitamin E and Potassium Chelate dissolved only at pH 2. Mucinex and Vitamin B dissolved fastest at pH 8. Tylenol caplets dissolved ten times faster than generic acetaminophen (2 minutes versus 20 minutes). There was no difference between the tablet and caplet forms of Tylenol, Excedrin and generic ibuprofen; however, generic acetaminophen tablets dissolved twice as fast as the caplets. The addition of the antacid TUMS to the pH 2 solution decreased the acidity (increased pH) by 2 units. Finally, the accuracy of this experiment was validated with Actifed using modified simulated gastric fluid and fed and fasted simulated intestinal fluid. In conclusion, this study shows that (1) the pH in the GI tract affects the dissolution of oral medicines and vitamins; (2) there can be significant differences in dissolution between name brand and generic medicines as well as between different formulations of the same medicine; (3) vitamins and other dietary supplements have poor dissolution even when taken as directed, raising the question of their effectiveness and the importance of obtaining these from readily available natural sources.

Kamehameha Schools Kapalama, Honolulu, HI

Purpose: The following experiments were done to confirm the 5T Sp site III correlation with HIVD.<br><br>Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from various brain tissue regions as well as peripheral blood of patients with HIVD using hemi-nested PCR. Samples were cloned into vectors, isolated, and sequenced. Biochemical testing continued as radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the ConB HIV-1 LTR, or the LTR containing genetic variant of the Sp binding site 3 (5T) were incubated with the Sp protein. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to film. <br><br>Results: 48.1% of isolated proviral DNA sequences (brain tissue) exhibited the 6G mutation at C/EBP Site I. While 55.6% of the isolated proviral DNA sequences (brain tissue) exhibited the 5T mutation at the Sp Site III. The 5T mutation was present in the peripheral blood 23 of 133 patients. The 3T C/EBP Site I Con B sequence was not present in any patient. The DNA binding domain with the 5T altered mutation shows to bind the Sp protein with a lower binding affinity than that of the Con B sequence. <br><br>Conclusions: A new 6G C/EBP site variant has been identified. The 5T Sp site III marker was present in the brain tissue of all patients. Thus the existence of Post-HAART genetic markers has been confirmed. This experiment has shown the 5T DBD has a low affinity for the Sp site III. Genetic variants could possibly be used as viral markers to predict HIV-1 associated end organ disease.

THE EFFECTS OF STIMULANTS ON MUSCLE TISSUE AUGMENTED WITH BODYBUILDING SUPPLEMENTS
Zachary Douglas Schmidt
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose was to determine whether commonly used stimulants (caffeine, epinephrine, and a saline control) will enhance the performance of muscle tissue augmented with commonly used bodybuilding supplements (creatine, whey protein, and ginseng root.) If the augmented muscle tissue was injected with stimulants, then an increase of performance would occur. Common bait leeches (muscle tissue) were fed the bodybuilding supplements prior to being subjected to strength tests after a stimulant injection. The leeches were suspended on a scale apparatus (a hanging hook with a centimeter scale backdrop) and stimulated with electric current (12V, 200mA, 1 Hz, sinusoidal wave) while masses (2g – 25g) were added after each stimulated contraction. Comparisons of the average length of contractions (ALC) and average percent of contractions (APC) to the saline injected control fed leeches were taken. Preliminary ginseng exposure caused 100% death in specimens. Preliminary caffeine injections caused a significant (F(2,12) = 3.89, p > .05) 61.1% decrease of 0.6 cm (F=5.28) in ALC and 21.4% increase of 12.8% (F=4.66) in APC in the creatine fed specimens. Preliminary epinephrine injections caused a significant (F(2,12) = 3.89, p > .05) 82.9% increase of 49.6% (F=4.66) in APC in the creatine fed specimens. All other data were insignificant according to the F-distribution and the null hypothesis was accepted for the effects of stimulants on the control and whey protein groups along with the effects of the creatine and whey protein on the saline, caffeine, and epinephrine groups.

BLOOD PRESSURE IN A MOUSE MODEL OF TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS: THE EFFECTS OF VITAMIN B6 TREATMENT
Meghan Michele Pantalia
Classen School of Advanced Studies, Oklahoma City, OK

Diabetes Mellitus type one is a chronic, progressive, debilitating disease caused by an autoimmune reaction to the pancreatic beta cells which produce the hormone, insulin. One hypothesized cause for complications of this disease is increased levels of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). AGEs are unavoidable byproducts of various metabolic pathways. These reactive intermediates bind to proteins, DNA, and other molecules and disrupt their structures and functions which lead to different diseases such as vascular complications of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension (Desai K, Wu L). <br><br>In this experiment C57 laboratory mice and spontaneous Akita type 1 diabetic mice were treated with vitamin B6 from seven weeks through five months old. Tail-cuff blood pressures were measured on the tail-artery. Blood pressures were measured by a machine connected to a laptop computer then data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel.<br><br>The results are based on an average of all the collected data for each group of mice. The data showed that diastolic and mean blood pressures showed an insignificant difference based on the T test. However, the systolic showed a significant difference. The untreated Akita mice had an average systolic blood pressure of 119.12 (SE +/- 1.68) while the vitamin B6 mice had an average systolic blood pressure of 113.87 (SE +/- 1.88). The vitamin B6 mice had a blood pressure essentially restored to that of a normal C57 mouse. One can conclude that as vitamin B6 has effects on AGEs, it’s possible this is the mechanism lowering systolic blood pressure in the mice.

BORON NEUTRON CAPTURE THERAPY: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR INCREASING BORON UPTAKE VIA VASODILATATION
David H. Drew, Satchel A. Siegel, 
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a cancer treatment relying on selective uptake of boron-10 in a tumor cell; however, therapeutic amounts of boron are difficult to achieve. Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a boronated amino acid developed to deliver boron-10 to tumor cells. Minoxidil, a vasodilator used to treat patients with hypertension, relaxes and dilates small blood vessels. <br><br>It was hypothesized that vasodilatation would enhance boron uptake in vital organs in Gallus gallus embryos. To test this hypothesis, embryos were injected on day 17 of incubation with the pediatric dosage of minoxidil, 0.2mg/kg; the minoxidil and BPA at 500mg/kg; BPA only; and a control group with neither compound. The brain, lungs and liver were removed from 9 embryos in each group and were dried for 24.5 hours at 65° Celsius in a laboratory oven. The 108 samples were prepared for boron analysis in an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). Results in counts per second of boron, and counts per second of boron organized by isotope, were recorded.<br><br>There was a higher boron concentration within the control organs than had been predicted. For embryos that received both minoxidil and BPA, changes in mean boron concentration and boron-11 to boron-10 ratios were observed in the different organs. However, additional analysis is ongoing to determine the significance of these results. This research emphasizes the need for further testing and analysis of the biodistribution of boronated compounds, so that BNCT can become a more effective treatment.

INHIBITING THE PROGRESSION OF HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS, PART II
Sonika Reddy, Sonya Jooma, 
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, GA

This project explored inhibiting the progression of Huntington’s disease in Caenorhabditis elegans through the use of the antioxidants Vitamin C, Astaxanthin, Niacin, Acetyl L-Carnitine, and Green Tea extracts at three different concentrations: 1000 mg of substance/ 10mL distilled water, 1000mg/ 30mL, and 1000mg/ 50mL. The C. elegans (strain HA759 which is pqe-1;rtIs18) used in this experiment were genetically modified to have the disease form of human huntingtin in the ASH sensory neurons. The hypothesis was that Green Tea extracts at a concentration of 1000mg/ 30mL would be the most effective at inhibiting the progression of Huntington’s. In order to test how effective each antioxidant was, a nose touch assay and an osmotic ring assay were conducted; both served as measure of motor function. The more neurologically sound a C. elegans is, the better its motor function is. According to both the nose touch and osmotic ring assay, the most effective inhibitor is Green tea extracts at a concentration of 1000mg/30mL and the second most effective is Green tea extracts at a concentration of 1000mg per 50mL. The ANOVA test was carried out in order to confirm the statistical significance of the results; the top two results were both found to be statistically significant at an alpha level of .01. Additionally, a vertical protein electrophoresis was attempted in order to determine if the antioxidants are affecting the proteins of the C. elegans. Unfortunately, the results of the electrophoresis proved inconclusive because of problems separating the C. elegans’s proteins and antioxidant residue.

HARVESTING THE HEART'S ENERGY USING PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS: A COMPARISON OF RIGHT ATRIAL, RIGHT VENTRICULAR, AND LEFT VENTRICULAR PACING SITES
Atmananda Mitra Persaud, Alexander Ditter, Christopher Ho
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

The purpose of our research project was to create a piezoelectric energy-harvesting device that utilized the mechanical motion of the various areas of the heart to power a pacemaker. We hypothesized that if we implanted the piezoelectric device in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle, the right ventricular pacing site would yield the greatest amount of energy because the right ventricular pacing site has the greatest displacement. To test our prediction, we glued polyvinylidene fluoride, a piezoelectric material, to a pacemaker lead to generate alternating current. We then created a circuit consisting of 4 diodes, 4 terminal screws, and a capacitor to convert AC current to DC and store the electric potential for later use. We tested our device by placing it in a flex tester, a device that simulates the beating of the heart by flexing the pacemaker lead with the attached piezoelectric material. We measured final voltage in the capacitor to determine how efficient our device was. Our results showed that placing the device in the right ventricle produced 4.7 times as much energy as placing the device in the right atrium and 280 times as much energy as placing the device in the left ventricle. Thus, any piezoelectric energy harvesting would be best done in the right ventricle.

A CYTOGENIC ANALYSIS OF GENETIC MUTATION INDUCED BY CIGARETTE SMOKE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Sehar Anjum Salman, Jada Dalley, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Second-hand smoke is a real threat to nonsmokers. Previous research in a continuing study, with Drosophila melanogaster, determined that second-hand smoke even affects the offspring of flies exposed to it. Recently, scientists have discovered that a new form of smoke, third-hand smoke, which is the residue of smoke left on clothing or furniture, may cause similar problems.<br><br> The purposes of this project were to determine if third-hand smoke could cause mutations, in flies, similar to those caused by second-hand smoke and if the locations of such mutations could be pinpointed on the Drosophila gene map.<br><br> It was hypothesized that third-hand smoke would, in fact, cause similar mutations and that these mutations could be indirectly identified in the Drosophila genome.<br><br> Through a series of experimental trials, flies were exposed to second-hand and third-hand smoke. In second-hand exposures, tubes were covered with mosquito netting to allow the smoke to enter the tube. In third-hand exposures, flies were transferred only after the vials, containing only food, were exposed. All flies were left to grow for two weeks, after which they were observed for mutations.<br><br> Results showed that the mutation for dichaete wings, where the wings are spread apart, was most common. This mutation, as well as others observed, could, indirectly, be localized in the Drosophila genome. <br><br> In conclusion, it was found that the gene for the dichaete wings could also be found on the human genome, adjacent to the gene for schizophrenia susceptibility, prompting hypotheses regarding possible correlations between smoking and mental illness.

HISTONE DEACETYLASE (HDAC) INHIBITION: A POTENTIAL THERAPY FOR BINGE ALCOHOL TOXICITY
Vishnu Kiran Kadiyala, Shilpa Mokshagundam, 
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Alcoholism, the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, is a common problem among many Americans. This study assessed the effects of binge drinking on Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (AFLD) on an epigenetic level. Enzymes such as Histone Deacetylases (HDACs), which alter histone acetylation, are critical epigenetic regulators of gene expression. It was hypothesized that ethanol (ETOH) would cause changes in HDAC, leading to AFLD-associated fat accumulation and apoptosis. It was further hypothesized that development of AFLD could be ameliorated by Trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor. For this study, we utilized a murine model to study the mechanisms of AFLD athogenesis, which is thought to occur via disruption in lipid metabolism. A possible explanation is upregulation of certain types of HDACs, resulting in etylation, leading to deregulation of fat accumulation and apoptosis. The qualified scientist divided the mice into 3 groups and treated them with ETOH alone, ETOH+TSA, or saline as a control. Liver tissue sections were subjected to Oil-Red-O fat staining and TUNEL-apoptosis staining. ETOH treated mice exhibited an increase in fat deposition (steatosis) and apoptotic cells, documenting liver injury; these effects were dramatically reduced by TSA. Enhanced hepatocyte injury (increased Aspartate-Aminotransferase and Alanine-Aminotransferase levels) was seen in ETOH treated animals, and was decreased by TSA treatment. Real-Time PCR showed that HDAC3 and HDAC8 were up-regulated by ETOH; treatment with TSA decreased HDAC expression. Results from this study provide proof-of-concept that epigenetic modifications, involving HDACs, in alcoholic mice may ameliorate development of AFLD and other adverse effects associated with binge drinking.

THE INTERNAL BATTLE WITH MELANOMA: TRIGGERING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE USING TOLL LIGANDS
Antonina Alexia Pavlenko, Laura Gudvangen, 
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO

It is unknown which tissues sustain TLRs (toll-like receptors). This experiment is the first to discern the presence of TLRs on B16F1 melanoma cells. The purpose was to trigger an immunological response using toll ligands in order to get the immune system to kill and/or decrease the growth of B16F1 melanoma cells due to inflammation triggered by TLR stimulation. The experiment was conducted in two parts. All handling of the mice, injections, measurements, and care, was done by authorized UCCS personnel. First, in vitro, during which, B16F1 melanoma cells was were separately treated with four different toll ligands: Pam_3Cys (correspondent of TLR2), Polyinosine:cytosine (correspondent of TLR3), R848 (correspondent of TLR7/8), and CpG:ODN (correspondent of TRL9). The results were promising and somewhat unexpected. The second part of the experiment included an in vitro and an in vivo investigation that used two sets of mice. Based on the results from the procedure part one only, Polyinosine: cytosine and R848 were used. One set of mice was treated with toll ligands intratumorly and the second set of mice was treated concomitantly, meaning that a toll ligand treated tumor was being injected. The results in vitro have shown that TLR 2, 3, 7/8, and 9 exist on B16F1 melanoma cells. In mice, the results, so far, have shown that the concomitantly treated tumors have had a significant delay in growth, which is very promising for this type of rapid growing melanoma. However, because of time restraint the full extent of the results is still not known. This project is currently progressing and will evaluate the full extent of the toll ligand treated tumors as well as study the T-cells that were triggered by the TLR stimulus.

DEGRADATION OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN SKIN BY MEANS OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID
Jennifer Suzanne Andrews, Brent M. Gargano, 
Sycamore High School, Cincinnati, OH

Acids and bases are two very commonly used solutions in many high school science classes. Although students know these chemicals are dangerous, every year they are still misused. If cultured skin cells are treated with a strong, concentrated acid or a strong, concentrated base, then we can show what cell damage may occur in a format that might be useful for publicizing safety in the teaching laboratory. For this experiment, it was decided to use hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as they are the two most commonly used acids and bases in almost any science laboratory. Tests were run on twelve in vitro skin samples using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to observe cell damage. Following experimentation, these in vitro samples were treated and photographed so we could visualize our results. Upon examination under a light microscope, clefting, vacuolization, and degradation of the DNA was visualized. Our results, crafted into poster form, can be used in science classrooms to show the effects of these acids and bases on skin if these chemicals are misused. To this end, 18 science teachers at our high school and 45 other regional high school science teachers were asked questions about our teaching resource. Of those responding 90% answered that they would use the resource in their classroom and 94% answered that they would use the resource as a teaching tool. In conclusion we have been able to support our hypothesis based on the data collected.

The current clinical contrast agent standard for MR imaging is a Gadolinium based imaging probe. However, current research has proven that Gadolinium undergoes transmetalation and as a result can cause severe to fatal complications and has done so in many cases, leading to potentially fatal diseases. As a result, there is a pressing requirement to discover another Nanoparticle on which to base MR contrast agents.The aim of the current study was to asses the feasibility of Manganese as a replacement for Gadolinium, using the micelles bound to an IK-17 antibody as a targeting moiety. Micelles were prepared and characterized with respect to size, efficacy, binding, and uptake in macrophages. All micelles exhibited sizes similar to that of high-density lipoproteins (<15nm). MRI was performed on ex-vivo aorta obtained from apolipoprotein deficient mice over a 72-hour interval after micelle injection. The results of these MRI scans revealed that the CNR (contrast to Noise Ratio) of Manganese was equivalent to that of Gadolinium. MRI was also performed on previously anesthetized apolipoprotein deficient mice over a 48-hour interval after Manganese micelle injection. The results of these scans found the Manganese probes conclusive in the detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Flow Cytometry was used in order to determine the toxicity and as a result the amount of transmetalation. Gadolinium showed signs of high levels of transmetalation and thus much more toxic.

PHENOTYPIC OBSERVATIONS OF A NEW SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY MOUSE MODEL
Stephanie Danielle Capogna, Tara Bonanno, 
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 6,000 newborns in the United States. SMA is caused by a deletion or a mutation of the SMN1 gene which is essential for the survival of motor neurons. Previous studies have led to the development of a mouse model that represents key features of SMA type 3, the least severe form of the disease. Although there are models that correspond to the other types of SMA, the A2G mouse model is the most accurate model developed for SMA type 3. This model is currently without a phenotype and thus we designed a battery of behavioral assessments to expose neurological malfunctions the inherent differences in the physical characteristics of the Knock Out (KO) and Wild Type (WT) mice. The results of this study showed several assessments that displayed clear trends which were consistent and differentiated the KO mice physically from the WT mice. These findings are valuable because they allow for a direct comparison of baseline assessments and a novel set of assessments after treatment which will allow the symptoms of SMA to be closely monitored. These finding are vital for the further research of SMA in this mouse model.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE MATERNAL HISTORY OF AD: RISK AND AGE OF DECLINE
Marcela Lizeth Erazo, Lauren Browne, 
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

The goal of the study was to explore the plausible relationship between the age of AD onset of normal (NL) subjects with a maternal family history (FHm) and the age of AD onset of normal (NL) subjects with a paternal family history (FHp). Records of subjects who have previously participated in AD studies were examined. Subjects included normally cognitive patients with and without maternal family history of AD. We found the mean age of AD onset of FHm subjects was approximately 5 years earlier than FHp subjects (P= .036). From this we suggest the possibility that FHm subjects may be at a greater risk of developing AD onset at an earlier age as compared to FHp.

THE DUAL EFFECTS OF BISPHENOL A AND NIFEDIPINE ON HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS
Katelynn Connell McShane, Rachel Wilkinson, 
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

ABSTRACT<br><br>The Dual Effects of Bisphenol A and Nifedipine on Human Endothelial Cell<br><br>Endothelial cells, which make up the innermost layer of human veins and arteries, play a very important role in circulation. By producing nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive gas, endothelial cells stimulate the relaxation vascular smooth muscle cells, thus widening arteries and lowering blood pressure. This experiment contained a two-pronged purpose: primarily, to determine whether or not Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical toxin found in many common plastics, lowers the NO production of endothelial cells; and secondly to observe the ability of nifedipine, a prescription drug designed to treat hypertension, to reverse BPA’s effects on the endothelial cells. <br><br>Using a lab culture of human endothelial cells, varied dilutions of BPA were tested for their toxicity as determined by the cells’ nitric oxide production. Interestingly, the results show that the lower dosages of BPA proved to be the most harmful to the cells, dropping the nitric oxide emission a substantial amount. Although it is speculated that this phenomenon is a result of BPA’s ability to alter the hormonal balance within cells, the true causes of BPA’s unique and disturbing toxicity qualities have yet to be identified.<br><br> In the second part of the experiment, only one dose of BPA was used (the medium dilution) in the presence of three different dilutions of nifedipine. The results showed that nifedipine did indeed reverse the effects of BPA. Overall, our experimental results support our hypothesis, thus further linking BPA to adverse health effects and shedding additional light on the chemical interactions of BPA and nifedipine.

NEUTRALIZATION OF HARMFUL LPS ON MOUSE MACROPHAGES USING ASS AND ANTI-LPS IGG
Alvin Wang, Gabriel Molina, 
Oak Hall Private School, Gainesville, FL

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is part of a group of pathogenic bacteria called gram-negative enterobacteria. This group also comprises of Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas. There are strains of E. coli that can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness and pneumonia, and, and if the case is severe enough it can cause death. Salmonella, commonly found in chicken and eggs also causes similar outcomes. Collectively, these enterobacteria cause over a hundred thousand infections each year. Infants, young children, or old people, who have a weaker immune system, are particularly vulnerable; they could have kidney failure, become blind, develop paralysis, and possibly die. Many of the toxic systemic responses, also known as sepsis or septic shock, are in fact caused by a harmful molecule known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin that is released by the E. coli or Salmonella bacterium into the blood stream. LPS, in turns, binds to the host cells such as macrophages, triggering a cascade of adverse systemic responses. However, there is an anti-LPS antibody (immunoglobin or IgG) that is known to bind to the LPS. There is also another LPS-binding protein called Argininosuccinate Synthase (ASS) produced by liver cells. <br><br>We hypothesize that by binding tightly to LPS, ASS and/or anti-LPS might prevent LPS from attaching to the host cells and thus neutralize its harmful effects. To determine whether ASS and the Anti-LPS IgG can prevent cells from being over-activated or injured by LPS, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) was incubated with LPS at two doses (0.1 and 1 µg/mL) for 6- 24 hours, in the presence or absence of ASS or anti-LPS.<br><br>After the incubation, a series of tests were run to determine whether ASS or Anti-LPS antibody had prevented or reduced the toxic LPS effect on the mouse macrophages. The tests used were for the mitochondrial function, cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cytoskeleton breakdown and cell morphological changes. Collectively, the results from these tests showed that, while Anti-LPS did provide some protection, ASS protein robustly neutralized the LPS and protected the mouse macrophages against the harmful effects of LPS. It was concluded that ASS protein might be a potential therapeutic treatment for septic shock.

SNAIL SLIME+ ALOE VERA= PERFECT SKIN?
Virginia Evans, Cecilia Vila, 
Liceo No. 1 "Mario W. Long", Young, Rio Negro, URUGUAY

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the effects of snail slime cream in human skin irregularities such as acne, wrinkles, scars, burn marks, striation, cellulite, etc.<br><br> The original idea was to extract the sail slime from average snails, but we then decided to feed garden snails (Helix Aspersa) with Aloe Vera because of its healthy properties, for example: antibiotic, regenerative, and others.<br><br> The snails were bred and fed exclusively with Aloe Vera for one month. The slime was extracted stressing the snails momentarily with acetic acid, then recollected, and finally poured into a neutral base cream. The snail slime gel was elaborated with a similar procedure.<br><br> The slime the snails secrete when they are stressed or scared has a high biochemical content that transforms old tissue into newer and healthier skin.<br><br> In conclusion, the properties of both, snail’s slime and Aloe Vera, together, would make the cream more effective. To prove this, there is a method called double-blinded which is used in cosmetic labs. Unfortunately, due to the lack of resources and time those tests were unable to be done, but a bacteriological study was made to the cream and gel which certifies that neither one is hazardous to human health. However, could not be tested for sensitive skins.

HIDDEN DANGERS OF AN EVERYDAY CONVENIENCE
Nicholas Levan Tabidze, Amanda Annesley Weber, 
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

Our project is about the possible risks (infertility, autism, diabetes, and cancer) of consuming items heated in a microwave oven using marketed microwave safe plastic containers. Our hypothesis is if we experiment with consumable items, labeled microwave safe, then our results will show negative and harmful effects.<br><br> To prove our hypothesis, we conducted our research at a lab, testing distilled water as our control and distilled water microwaved in plastic as our variable. We tested our samples for two specific toxins in plastic, benzene and bisphenol-A. We used hexane to separate the chemicals from the water. We used nitrogen and mash beads to make our samples more concentrated. Then we placed each of our samples in the Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) to test for the chemicals.<br><br> Additionally, we experimented with plants and potatoes to test their growth and health using our control and variable samples. We rooted three sets of potatoes, using six potatoes for each sample of water. We watered our experiments as needed and observed them for growth and hardiness.<br><br> Our results from the GC/MS proved inconclusive, due to the possible contamination of the testing equipment or non-sterile environment. More visible results were shown in the eighteen potato and plant experiments.<br><br> We conclude that the toxins used in microwave safe plastic containers leach into foods and beverages when heated in a microwave oven, and cause harm when consumed.

COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF CURCUMIN VS. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS ON BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER CELL LINES
Lola S Yu, Linda Chau, 
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA

Curcumin, also known as the Indian spice turmeric, has been a major interest in research dealing with potential treatments for cancer. In this experiment, the effect of curcumin was measured in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, and ovarian cancer cells, OVCAR3, to see how it compared with the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs: taxol, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. As a natural substance, curcumin will not only have fewer side effects, but it will also be less costly for cancer patients compared to chemotherapy. <br><br>To compare the effects of curcumin to the chemotherapeutic drugs, two assays were conducted. The MTT assay system determined the viability of the cancer cells following treatment with curcumin and the chemotherapeutics. The Caspase assay system measured apoptosis of the cancer cells through caspse-3 after treatment with the anticancer reagents. These two assays will not only show whether or not the reagents prevented the cancer cells from growing, but also if they killed the cells through apoptosis. <br><br>The experimentation showed that curcumin is equally potent to all three chemotherapeutics when used at the highest dose, a 100 micromolar concentration. This means that it takes a higher concentration of curcumin in order to get the same effects as the chemotherapeutic drugs. The findings also showed that curcumin worked the best when inducing cell apoptosis through activation of the enzyme caspase-3. <br><br>In the future, curcumin can potentially serve as a safer alternative to chemotherapeutics, become a major chemopreventive drug, or even work together with chemotherapeutics to better fight cancer.

CHARACTERIZING THE MELANOMA STEM/INITIATING CELL "NICHE"
Yunwei Sun, Moriah Smith, 
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Melanoma is arguably the most aggressive human cancer. Treatment failure is largely attributed to a subpopulation of cells known as melanoma stem/initiating cells (MSICs), which possess the capability of unlimited self-renewal, and are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Effective therapy for melanoma, therefore, requires means to eliminate the MSICs. Recently, studies in brain tumors indicate that like normal stem cells, brain tumor stem/initiating cells (BTSICs) exist in specialized compartments within the tumor, known as “perivascular niches”. Such niches provide the essential micro-environmental signals to maintain the functional integrity of the BTSICs. The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the CD133+ MSIC “niche”. Characterization of MSICs in the context of their “niches” promises to uncover potential therapeutic targets for their effective elimination.<br><br> Double immunofluorescence staining, was used to examine the spatial relationship of CD133+ MSICs and CD31+ endothelial cell (EC)-lined blood vessels on cryosections of tumor xenografts derived from melanoma cell line, WM983C. <br><br> Results showed that CD133+ MSICs reside in close proximity to the CD31+ EC-lined blood vessels, analogous to the “perivascular niche” previously described in brain tumors. The discovery of the “MSIC niche” allows us now to further define the cellular components and tissue organization of the perivascular “niche” microenvironment, and to dissect molecular signals within the “niche” that contribute to the maintenance of MSICs. Knowledge acquired from these investigations should provide new insights into novel strategies to indirectly eliminate MSICs through targeting their niche-dependency.

EFFECTS OF ZERO CALORIE SWEETENERS ON SERRATIA MARCESCENS AND ESCHERICHIA COLI
Kylie Rachelle Butler, Carly Wimmer, 
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

Zero-calorie sugar substitutes are very popular with diabetics and individuals on diets. Research hinted that these products might actually be metabolized by humans, which could be a problem for diabetics monitoring their blood sugar levels. We were curious whether or not these sugar substitutes are metabolized by bacteria. If they can, it may suggest that humans might also be able to, because both metabolize sugars through the Krebs Cycle. We used two kinds of bacteria that are known to metabolize glucose – Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. <br><br>We cultured the bacteria in five different groups: 2% non-nutrient agar, nutrient agar, different concentrations of sucrose, sucralose (an artificial sugar substitute), and Truvia (a natural sugar substitute). We plated the bacteria on the agar mixtures. No growth occurred on the non-nutrient agar. There was growth on the nutrient agar, sucrose, sucralose, and Truvia plates. They grew on concentrations as low as 1% sucrose, sucralose, and Truvia.<br><br>After finding out that the bacteria could grow on the sugar substitutes, we quantified it in order to make the results more accurate. We cultured both types of bacteria in six different groups; the five used in the first experiment and glucose. We measured out the amount of bacteria using a micropipette, and cultured them in flasks. We measured the growth using a spectrophotometer. We did two runs of these different percentages: .5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and 10%. <br><br>Results show that zero-calorie sugar substitutes are metabolized by S. marcescens and E. coli.

A FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND IDENTIFICATION
Sajith M Wickramasekara, Andrew Guo, 
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Chemotherapeutic drugs function by inducing cytotoxicity in rapidly dividing cells through mitotic impairment or forced apoptosis. It is common for non-cancerous cells to be affected by these drugs, resulting in detrimental side effects. To mediate these undesired responses, we proposed a genomic framework using the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion collection to identify genes that confer resistance to DNA damaging agents including chemotherapeutic drugs. Based on the genomic conservation of yeast with humans, we determined human orthologs to our yeast targets and verified their roles in mediating cellular response to DNA damage. Our initial genome-wide screen in diploid yeast identified 376 genes that conferred resistance to the widely used G1/S phase chemotherapeutic drug, Doxorubicin. A similar haploid yeast screen identified five-fold fewer targets, which, due to a lack of recombination ability in G1 haploids, suggests the presence of a G1/S specific DNA repair network in diploid yeast. To further test our framework we screened the G1 toxin zymocin and identified significant genetic overlap with the genes that mediate doxorubicin resistance, indicating zymocin’s potential as a chemotherapeutic agent. Successful development of our framework has direct application in sensitizing tumors, identifying novel treatments, and building a foundation for personalized medicine.

DEVELOPMENT OF A URINE TEST FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER
Janet Song, Benjamin Song, 
Methacton High School, Eagleville, PA

It is known that the earlier a cancer is detected, the better the prognosis. Thus, the goal of this study was to develop a urine test for cancer screening. Previous studies have demonstrated that human urine contains circulation-derived low MW DNA (150-250 bp) that can be used to detect cancer-associated genetic alterations and that many current cancer biomarkers have low sensitivities and specificities. We hypothesized that the use of low MW urine DNA will enhance the sensitivity and specificity of a urine cancer screening test. To test our hypothesis, a method to preferentially isolate low MW DNA from urine using carboxylated magnetic beads, with a 92.72% + 1.42% high MW DNA removal efficiency, was further refined (patent pending) and an assay for a CRC-related epigenetic DNA marker, the hypermethylated vimentin gene, was developed for urine screening. It was found that the sensitivity and specificity of a urine test using vimentin to detect CRC was enhanced significantly (p-value = 0.0233 for colorectal cancer patients; p-value = 0.0123 for patients with adenomatous polyps) when low MW urine DNA was used as compared to total urine DNA. Furthermore, there was a significantly higher concordance between low MW DNA and its corresponding tissue DNA than between total urine DNA and tissue DNA (p-value = 0.0015). This study demonstrates the viability of a urine screening test using low MW urine DNA and a vimentin hypermethylation assay. Clinical applications and further research are discussed.

SCREENING MARINE ALGAE FOR POTENTIAL ANTI-CANCER COMPOUNDS BASED ON THE MITOTIC INHIBITION OF SEA URCHIN EMBRYOS
Kin Israel Rosal Notarte, Jamie A. Mananquil, Karina Louise B. de la Cruz
Ramon Teves Pastor Memorial-Dumaguete Science High School, Dumaguete City, Oriental Negros, PHILIPPINES

Marine macroalgae were screened using a functional test method to determine their level of mitotic inhibition and the presence of potential anti-cancer compounds.<br><br> Four percent solution of crude extracts of freshly collected marine macroalgae (Portieria hornemannii, Sargassum cristaefolium, Halimeda discoidea, Codium geppiorum, Laurencia thuyoides, Laurencia papillosa, Caulerpa racemosa, and Gracilaria arcuata) was tested for mitotic inhibition using embryos of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla. Vincristine sulfate at 20 and 25 mcg/mL was used as positive control. At 30 minutes intervals, cell numbers in 250 embryos were counted until seawater controls reached the 32-cell stage.<br><br> The P. hornemannii, a red alga with known strong anti-cancer activity, caused nearly complete mitotic inhibition comparable to 25 mcg/mL Vincristine sulfate. Statistically significant results were routinely obtained within three hours. Trials carried for nine hours to hatching of the free-swimming blastula showed greater than 99% survival. The L. papillosa, C. racemosa and G. arcuata showed strong inhibition. The first two macroalgae are reported to have anti-cancer properties. The G. arcuata, has not previously been reported to show anti-cancer potential. The S. cristaefolium, H. discoidea, C. geppiorum and L. thuyoides showed slight or no inhibition. None of these four have been reported to have anti-cancer activity.<br><br> Results revealed that marine macroalgae show potential as new source of anti-cancer drug that may possibly answer our longing cure for cancer.

THE SHOCKING TRUTH OF ACID

Hays High School, Hays, KS

Dental caries is widespread among youth who ingest large amounts of candy and carbonated beverages. A certain candy is known for its tart taste and is a favorite of the researchers and their friends. It was feared that if a person eats one package of this candy per week the teeth of that person would lose mass.<br><br>Clean, dry bovine teeth were massed and placed in various solutions of the candy and water. The teeth were removed from the solutions after 48 hours and re-massed. The pH of each solution was measured before and after the addition of the teeth to determine whether the teeth were reacting with the ingredients of the candy to affect the pH of the solution. Four trials for each of 20 different solutions were conducted.<br><br>It was found that as the number of candies increased, the pH of the solution decreased significantly. However, the percentage of mass lost by each tooth did not appear to be related to the pH of the solution and thus to the number of candies in solution.<br><br>Although this investigation does not take into account variations in oral hygiene, it can be assumed that the number of candies ingested does not affect the amount of corrosion of teeth. Further investigation should include using synthetic saliva instead of water for the candy solutions, as the interaction between the amylase in saliva and the dextrose in the candy might provide a more realistic indication of the effect of the candy on teeth.

WHAT'S IN YOUR HAIR?
Cornelia Kathleen Lluberes, Caroline Braun, 
Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, Washington, DC

The hypothesis of this experiment was if a person smokes or resides with a smoker, he or she will have more nicotine in his or her hair than someone who has had no considerable smoke exposure, regardless of residence. <br><br>The first step in the procedure was to acquire an ample number of volunteers. After the three groups (A-Smokers, B-Non-Smokers, and C-Children of Smokers) were determined, we distributed surveys to each participant with questions concerning age, weight, residence, and smoke exposure. Afterward, we cut between 20.0-260.0 mg of hair from each participant and placed each hair sample into test tubes containing dichloromethane according to the ratio, 20.0 mg of hair per every 3.0 mL of dichloromethane. For approximately the next 72 hours, we allowed the dichloromethane to extract the nicotine from the hair samples. After the time period, we transferred the dichloromethane from the individual test tubes to a series of cuvettes to be examined by the spectrophotometer, a machine which shows the amount of light indirectly absorbed by the nicotine. <br><br>After all the absorbance readings had been documented, we used the equation, A=ebc (Absorbance as depicted by the spectrophotometer= extinction constant x pavelength x concentration), to determine the relationship between light absorbance projected by the spectrophotometer to the concentration of nicotine in each hair sample. By using a standard concentration of nicotine (.0006 moles/L), we found the absorbance (A) of nicotine to be .094. With the variables A, c, and b (1.2 cm), we determined e, the extinction constant, to be roughly 130 L/mole x cm. <br><br>For Group A, the average concentration was .00016266, .000009744 for Group B, and .000081795 for Group C (all measured in moles/L). On average, the percent increase from Group B to A was 1569 %, 98 % from Group C to A, and 739 % from Group C to B. According to our results and calculations, we concluded that the hair of smokers will have a much greater concentration of nicotine then the hair of nonsmokers and that of people exposed to secondhand smoke. Furthermore, we concluded that the hair of people exposed to secondhand smoke will also have more nicotine than that of people with negligible smoke exposure.

FOOD ADDITIVE OR CARCINOGEN? CARRAGEENAN INHIBITS ASB ACTIVITY AND INDUCES CELL INVASION INVOLVING RHOA ACTIVATION AND MMP-9 SECRETION
Prithwis Kumar Mukhopadhyay
Woodbury High School, Woodbury, MN

My previous study suggested that treatment of mammary epithelial cells with common food additive carrageenan inhibited Arylsulfatase B (ASB) activity, and a decrease in ASB activity induced cell migration by increasing chondroitin sulfate content on cell surface. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of ASB, chondroitin sulfate, RhoA and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in migration and invasion of malignant and nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells. Results from current study revealed that low ASB activity due to carrageenan treatment, ASB silencing, or malignancy induced RhoA activation and MMP-9 expression/ secretion in mammary epithelial cells. On the contrary, ASB overexpression reduced RhoA activation and MMP-9 secretion. Treatment of MCF-7 or MCF-10A cells with carrageenan alone or in combination with RhoA inhibitor (Y27632) showed that RhoA inhibitor partially inhibited carrageenan–induced MMP-9 secretion. This observation indicates that activated RhoA is one, but not the sole inducer of MMP-9 secretion. Carrageenan was also found to increase MMP-9 expression and migration of mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, carrageenan induced the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 and invasion of mammary cells. These observations collectively suggest that carrageenan induces the activation of RhoA and increases expression, secretion and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 by reducing the ASB activity and increasing the chondroitin sulfate content on cell surface. RhoA activation together with increased MMP-9 expression/ secretion induces migration and invasion of mammary epithelial cells by actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and extracellular matrix degradation.

ROLE OF PKC IOTA/LAMBDA IN CARRAGEENAN-INDUCED INFLAMMATORY PAIN RESPONSE
Charles David Morris
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

Chronic pain, which is persistent pain experienced past point of recovery, is one of the most problematic medical conditions in the world today. Based on studies that have suggested chronic pain may be caused by biochemical changes similar to those involved in memory formation, the goal of my study was to link an isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) involved in memory formation, known as PKC iota/lambda, to the signaling mechanism that triggers chronic pain. I used immunohistochemistry and Western blots to determine if PKC iota/lambda, which until now has only been found in the brain, is expressed in the spinal cord during inflammatory pain response. In addition, I compared expression levels of PKC iota/lambda to expression levels of PKC gamma, which is another isoform of PKC known to be present in the spinal cord during inflammatory pain response. Results showed that PKC iota/lambda is expressed in spinal cord tissue during inflammatory pain response. Furthermore, results showed that PKC iota/lambda is expressed in the same laminae of the spinal cord as PKC gamma during inflammatory pain response. These results suggest PKC iota/lambda is involved in processing inflammatory pain in the spinal cord. Results also suggest PKC iota/lambda has potential as a therapeutic target to alleviate chronic pain.

THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF TOLFENAMIC ACID AND RADIATION ON SP1 AND SURVIVIN IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER
Shannon Somer Stockton
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Up-regulation of members of the Sp protein family is associated with cell proliferation and metastasis in cancer. Sp1 has been identified as a transcription factor for the production of survivin, a protein which is over-expressed in cancer cells. In previous studies, survivin has been directly linked to radiation resistance through the suppression of apoptosis. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of Tolfenamic acid, a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drug, and radiation on the expression levels of Sp1 and Survivin proteins in the Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma cell line UMSCC-1. The researcher hypothesized Tolfenamic acid would significantly decrease Sp protein expression, thus inhibiting both constitutive and radiation-induced survivin protein expression. As a result, cell death should be enhanced on cells treated with Tolfenamic acid and radiation. Furthermore, the addition of the drug 24hrs prior to radiation exposure should potentiate cell death more than adding drug after radiation. <br><br>A cell proliferation assay was performed to determine the effects of 75 µM of the drug and 10 Gy of radiation on cell growth. Then, a western blot protein analysis was performed to check for the levels of Sp1 and survivin after drug treatment and radiation therapy. The data collected suggests that Tolfenamic acid has the potential to increase the response of head and neck cancer cells to radiation therapy. By regulating the expressions of sp1 using Tolfenamic Acid, it is possible to reduce the expression of the sp-dependent anti-apoptotic protein survivin, thus sensitizing the cancer cells to radiation.

SITE DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MYXOMA VIRAL PROTEIN M-T7
Navya A. Reddy
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

Inflammation caused by atherosclerosis can be studied with the use of viral proteins, such as the viral chemokine modulating protein M-T7, from the Myxoma virus. Chemokines form gradients that direct inflammatory cells to sites of infection by binding to glycosaminoglycans. Previous studies of rat aortic models have shown significantly reduced inflammatory cell invasion and plaque growth from the binding of M-T7 to chemokines. However, M-T7's structure and ability of binding to these receptors remains undefined. It was hypothesized that a highly phospholipids concentrated and flexible region of M-T7, between the N-terminus and C-terminus, was the key area for specific interactions with chemokines. A specific mutation was inserted into the viral protein through the polymerase chain reaction, and molecular cloning was performed through restriction digest, ligation into plasmid pFastBacDual, and transformation into E-coli bacterial cells. The clones will be further transfected into bacterial cells, enabling recombinant protein production and inserted into mice in future studies to determine the characteristics of the M-T7 contruct. The characteristics of M-T7's inhibition of chemokine function will be further understood with the development of this generated mutation.

A STUDY OF T CELL VIABILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI-CANCEROUS AGENTS
Katia Samer Chadaideh
Lake Howell High School, Winter Park, FL

While T cells are prominent in immune system responses, their reactions to becoming cancerous themselves are not completely understood. In order for accurate tests to be conducted on cancerous T cells, an assay must be developed to track significant characteristics of T cell development. Verifying an assay to determine the viability of a T cell was the primary focus of this experiment. To develop the assay, a T cell line, D1 suspension cells, was used. An important growth factor for the D1 T cell line is interleukin-7 (IL-7). For purposes of developing the viability assay IL-7 was added or removed from the growth media of D1 T cells and the resulting cell death was measured by microscopy using a nontoxic dye called Trypan Blue. <br><br> The second stage of the project ensued by testing commercially available viability assays using D1 T cells grown with or without IL-7. Comparisons were made between the results of the viabilities derived from microscopic evaluation to those viabilities achieved with commercial kits under the same growth conditions. After analyzing the resulting data, it was determined that the average doubling time for T cell growth with IL-7 was 24 hours, and the cells enriched with IL-7 reached this time point. The cells devoid of IL-7 did not reach the accurate doubling time, and their cell death was significantly greater. When reviewing the kits, Vybrant DyeCycle Violet/Sytox AADvanced apoptosis kit was the most precise in determining the percentage of cell viability in T cells.

ANTIBODY-COATED MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES: TARGETING AND TREATING CANCER IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
Philip Samuel Schlenoff
Maclay School, Tallahassee, FL

One of the most promising new tools in nanomedicine is the functionalized magnetic nanoparticle. By coating the surfaces of these particles with various protective and selective elements, it may be possible to create an inexpensive, safe, and efficient cancer treatment for any cancer tumor accessible by fenestrated or sinusoidal capillaries (which cover 90% of the body). <br><br> <br><br>The goal of this project was to create a nanoparticle-based cancer treatment capable of targeting tumors in vivo, which are then thermally ablated using radio frequency irradiation. There are, however, complications with in vivo delivery due to the various salts, proteins, and lymphocytes that tend to aggregate and eliminate foreign particles in the bloodstream.<br><br> <br><br>In this project, a zwitterionic coating was applied in order to mask the particles from the immune system and allow the treatment to circulate long enough to reach targeted sites. These particles have also been conjugated to the breast cancer-specific antibody, anti-HER2, enabling selective properties that will leave healthy cells untouched. These zwitterionic nanoparticles have been shown to fluoresce under secondary antibody staining (which binds to the primary antibody) 800% more intensely than the control, indicating that the primary antibodies are present on the surface of the particles.<br><br> <br><br>To simulate in vivo trials, an “Animal Simulation Environment” (ASE) was devised in order to test the treatment in a dynamic system that mimics the diffusion of particles out of capillaries and into tumors. ASE trials show significant (44% average) targeted cancer cell death after only 2 hours of incubation and 1.5 hours of RF irradiation.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL SMOKING AND DRUG ABUSE OF FETAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT
Mary Elizabeth Smith
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Nicotine and methamphetamine are two of the most frequently abused substances throughout parturition that critically inhibit fetal brain development. The aftermath of the maternal decision to continue these habits during and after pregnancy can frequently be seen in children with attention deficit disorders, cognitive disorders, and children who have died due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).In order to test the effects of cigarette constituents and methamphetamine on fetal brain development, rat tissues which were previously treated by qualified scientists with cigarette smoke and methamphetamines in an approved studies were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)for neurotransmitter concentrations in the striatum and brainstem. The concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were compared on different postnatal days for fluctuations, and the turnover rate was calculated for 5-HT, DA, and their major metabolites. The dopamine concentrations and the turnover rate were most affected by the methamphetamine challenge. The biggest impact on the serotonin levels were found in tissues exposed to both methamphetamine and nicotine. The results from experimentation suggests that maternal exposure to cigarette smoke and methamphetamines produce region and time specific changes in most monoamine neurotransmitters such as DA and 5-HT. Overall, the results the changes in production of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in fetal brains exposed to smoke and/or methamphetamine are indicative of the possible alterations in brain functions that could lead to certain malfunctions or disorders.

IN VITRO TESTING OF PROPRIONIBACTERIUM ACNES WITH SPECIFIC AVIAN ANTIBODIES
Taylor Elizabeth Welu
Marshall Senior High School, Marshall, MN

Last year, the objective for my science fair project was to create a natural treatment for acne using avian antibodies. Since I would be testing on humans, I needed to get approval from the FDA to run the tests, which takes two years. Because of this, I decided to do various in vitro tests to see if I could prove that the antibody could overtake the bacteria.<br><br> The first step in my experiment was to obtain a sample of my bacterium. The bacterium I was looking for is called Proprionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and lives in the sebaceous glands on the skin. When a pimple erupted on my face, I popped it and swabbed it with a sterile swab. <br><br> Once I had the sample I needed to streak it out onto blood agar plates. Next, I had to pass from the stationary culture to grow up the cells to an even larger amount. I injected 15 chickens once a week for 4 weeks with the immunogen I created. I decided to run an ELISA test, a cytotoxicity test, and a pour plate tests. The ELISA test was to show that the antibodies from the injected chickens' eggs specific to Proprionibacterium Acnes can bind and neutralize the Proprionibacterium Acnes bacteria I grew up. The cytotoxicity test is a test that uses cell culture to determine if a component or extract of a material or a bacterium will cause cell death. Lastly, I decided to run a P. acnes pour plate test test to show the effect of the antibody on a “lawn” of bacteria. <br><br> I was able to prove that running the in vitro tests could prove that the antibodies could overtake the bacterium.

THE ROLE OF PGC-1ALPHA IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Sonika Reddy
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, GA

Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, currently has no cure. The disease is clinically characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinisia, and postural instability. Current medicines only treat some of the symptoms and can lead to the development of dyskinesia. During autopsies of former PD patients extensive oxidative damage and dysfunctional mitochondria have been observed. Because PPAR coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) serves as a controlling agent of mitochondrial synthesis and antioxidant defense, it may serve as a neuroprotector of PD. Furthermore, variants in the PGC-1alpha gene have shown to correlate with a later onset age of Huntington's disease, another neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, this study analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PGC-1alpha gene for risk and age of onset of PD. Especially interesting was SNP rs6821591, which showed association with the risk of PD and longevity. However, the data was not statistically significant so a more in depth study should be completed.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFICACY OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPEUTIC AGENTS AGAINST COLON, PANCREATIC, AND URINARY BLADDER CANCER CELL PROLIFERATION, IN VITRO
Christopher Daniel Louviere
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, FL

The experiment determined if a range of concentrations of alternative therapeutic agents would decrease colon, pancreatic, and urinary bladder cancer cell proliferation within twenty-four hours after application and removal of the agents.<br><br>Three separate studies were conducted for each cancer type. Ozonated virgin olive oil, aged garlic extract, frankincense oil, active Leptospermum scoparium honey, and mustard oil were applied to the cultured cancer cells at 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10000 dilutions for twenty-four hours and then removed. A set of cells was fixed immediately, twelve hours, and twenty-four hours after the agents were removed. The numbers of cells at three specific points on each cover slip were counted and compared to the corresponding number of cells for each negative control. Positive and negative controls were performed for each cancer type and time point. <br><br>Frankincense oil was the most effective overall. Ozonated virgin olive oil was the least effective overall. Mustard oil was the most effective against urinary bladder cancer. Frankincense oil was the most effective against colon and pancreatic cancer. <br><br>The experiment supports the hypothesis: if ozonated virgin olive oil, aged garlic extract, frankincense oil, active Leptospermum scoparium honey, and mustard oil are applied to colon, pancreatic, and urinary bladder cancer at various dilutions, then cancer cell proliferation will decrease within twenty-four hours after the application and removal of the agents.

A STUDY OF TYPES I AND II DIABETES USING INSULIN GENE MICROSATELLITES
Amy Elizabeth Meyer
Oakville Senior High School, St. Louis, MO

Familial Diabetes studies have indicated a variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) located within the 5’ promoter region, approximately 600bp upstream from the transcriptional start site, of the human insulin gene as predictive for the development of types I and II Diabetes. The longer, Class III allele (138-159 repeats) appears to be protective, while the shorter, Class I allele (28-44 repeats) may result in a higher probability of developing Diabetes. The intermediate, Class II allele is rare in European-descent Caucasians and therefore less studied. Because this information gives researchers minimal insight into the mystery of Diabetes inheritance, more thorough studies are needed to fully characterize the transmission of the VNTR from generation to generation. <br><br>One extended family affected by both types I and II Diabetes was studied with pedigree and PCR analysis of the VNTR region. PCR patterns provided a visual representation of the various classes of repeats. Both Class I and the rare Class II alleles were visualized in this family. Through pedigree analysis based upon the results of the PCR amplification, we also predicted the presence of the class III allele in some family members, as well as the possibility of genetic imprinting from the transmission of father to daughter for the primary affected individual. After further research into the family’s history, distant Cherokee ancestors provided a possible basis for the origin of the Class II allele in this family, supplying an explanation for the allele’s presence in the primarily European-descent Caucasian family.

TREATMENT OF DIABETIC VASCULAR DISEASE BY TARGETING TGF-β1 GENE
Samantha Renae Prabakaran
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

Diabetes impairs vascular repair resulting in heart attacks, strokes, blindness, and kidney failure. Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) aid vascular repair. Diabetes impairs the function of EPCs by up-regulating the TGF-β1 gene. Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers or PMO’s down- regulate genes. Hypothesis: Since diabetes up-regulates the TGF-β1 gene causing EPC dysfunction, ‘TGF-β1 gene PMO’ will cause a ‘knock-down’ of the TGF-β1gene, correct EPC function and enhance vascular repair. Method: Student isolated EPCs from the blood samples of healthy and diabetic patients, treated EPCs with TGF-β1 gene PMO or control PMO, and then performed in vitro EPC functional studies. Student evaluated retinal tissue for EPC incorporation into vasculature. Results: a. In vitro tests showed an improvement in EPC functions of migration, proliferation and NO production by TGF-β1 gene PMO compared to control PMO EPCs (p > .05). b. In vivo studies showed increased vascular incorporation of TGF-β1 gene PMO vs. control EPCs (p > .05). Conclusion: Blockade of TGF-β1 gene using TGF-β1 PMO improved EPC reparative functions both in vitro and in vivo. Applications: Worldwide 171 million people have diabetes and by 2030, the projection is 360 million. TGF-β1 blockade with PMO technology represents a novel strategy to restore reparative functions in diabetic EPCs to treat vascular complications. This research is also unique in utilizing autologous cell replacement therapy, wherein EPCs isolated from a patient are treated with PMO ex vivo and re-administered, alleviating tissue donor search and avoiding tissue rejection.

SYNTHETIC LYCOPENE: BARRIER TO A549 HUMAN CARCINOMA LYNG CELLS FROM UVC LIGHT, 4TH YEAR STUDY
Taylor Kade Runyan
Atoka High School, Atoka, OK

Most people are aware of the effects of UV light though painful sunburns, but more important is that repeated sunburns can lead to skin cancer. Human and plants have natural protection against UV radiation. Red tomatoes contain lycopene, a pigment that helps prevent cell damage and there is some evidence that it may prevent or inhibit some types of cancer in humans. Supermarket tomatoes were tested and results showed that lycopene was highest in the grape and cherry types. Results also showed that synthetic lycopene and lycopene from tomatoes blocks UV light as assayed by light sensitive paper. Further testing of synthetic and natural lycopene was done to see which blocks UV light more effectively. Again, results showed that synthetic lycopene blocks more effectively and is easier to use. Sunscreen also prevents the direct DNA damage, which causes sunburn. Some sunscreens include compounds such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and avobenzone, which helps protect against UV rays. UVA, UVB, and UVC can damage collagen fibers and accelerate aging of the skin. I hypothesized that lycopene is a physical barrier to ultraviolet radiation. To examine the ability of lycopene to protect against UV energy, a test was performed using synthetic lycopene applied to saran wrap above lung cancer cells (A549) followed by exposure to UVC light. Results indicate that synthetic lycopene does protect the cells against UVC light as indicated by measurements of cell survival at times after treatment. This preliminary data supports the hypothesis that lycopene is a barrier to ultraviolet light.

DETERMINING THE ANITPROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS AND ROLE OF APOPTOSIS ON HUMAN LUNG CANCER CELLS BY QUERCETIN
Shannon Renee Sacksteder
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

Current research involving the complex nature of quercetin could lead to nontraditional treatments of modern diseases like cancer. The purpose of this project was to determine the optimal concentration of quercetin that could inhibit lung cancer cell growth. If lung cancer cells were exposed to micromolar concentrations of quercetin, antiproliferative effects on the cells would be observed and apoptotic proteins would be involved. Cells from the human lung cancer cell line H1793 were placed into treated cell culture flasks containing 5mL of tissue culture medium. The culture was checked daily, and the media was replaced every 48 hours due to accumulated cell waste. When the cells multiplied and reached a confluency of 80%, they were trypsinized, collected, and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded in well plates at 5000 cells/well in growth culture medium. After 24 hours, the media was replaced with another media containing charcoal stripped fetal calf serum which lacked hormones. After another 24 hours, the cells were treated with micromolar concentrations of quercetin ranging from 1uM quercetin to 100uM quercetin, and cell proliferation assays were performed on days 2, 4, and 6. Two controls were also applied: the untreated cells and DMSO (what quercetin is soluble in). Each treatment was done in quadruplicate, and the experiment was repeated five times. Using the proliferation data collected, the LC50 for quercetin was determined to be 16 µM for Day 6. Since antiproliferating results were observed, Western blot analysis was used to determine if apoptotic proteins changed in concentration. According to the Western Blot analysis, the pro-apoptotic Bax protein may have potentially been expressed at 50 µM quercetin. However, further analysis is necessary to fully support this observation. Based on statistical analysis on the 0.05 level, Day 6 showed that small quercetin concentrations around 20 µM caused the most significant decrease in lung cancer cell proliferation. Higher concentration had no further effect on the human lung cancer cells.

THE EFFECT OF AGE ON ABILITY TO PERCEIVE HIGH FREQUENCIES
Julia Kathryn Black
Yorktown High School, Arlington, VA

The purpose of this project was to compare people of different ages to their abilities to hear high frequencies. The experiment was also performed to determine what age groups the “Mosquito,” a high frequency emitter used to keep teen loiterers away from stores, affects. An iTunes playlist of high frequency sound files ranging from eight kilohertz to twenty-two kilohertz was played for one hundred and fifty people. There were five age groups each consisting of thirty subjects and split into ten-year age ranges. The total range of age was eleven years to sixty years. The sound file(s) heard by each individual were recorded. <br><br>According to the collected data, as the age ranges progressed within each group, high frequency hearing was lost. The data indicated that people begin to develop presbycusis (natural hearing loss condition) between the ages of thirty and forty. Additionally, the data showed that very few people above the age of nineteen could hear the seventeen kilohertz frequency, which is the standard sound emitted from the “Mosquito.” The Chi- Square contingency test showed that there was a statistical relationship between the two variables (age and ability to perceive high frequencies).<br><br>As a person ages, the hair-like sensory receptors in the human ear gradually die and less are present to interpret the sound, thus resulting in hearing loss. The data demonstrated the ages that are capable of hearing “Mosquito” frequencies as well as when a person naturally begins to lose ability to hear high sounds.

BRAIN ACTIVATION AND MAPPING WITH FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Shannon Marie Bidwell
Dayton Christian High School, Miamisburg, OH

In a conjunctive visual search task, which lobes of the brain are activated?<br><br> <br><br>If a conjunctive visual search task is administered, then brain activation will occur in the occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes.<br><br>The first step was to calculate brain activation for each data set that resulted from the conjunctive visual search task, using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Software Library calculator, followed by anatomically registering all data sets to the first data set. The resulting data was used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and one sample t-test. Subsequently the number of activated voxels in each lobe was calculated. <br><br>The results demonstrated high concordance relative to the hypothesis. Three primary regions activated: the occipital, frontal and parietal lobes. The occipital lobes were the principal lobes activated, demonstrating the highest mean of activated voxels of 15033.33 followed by the frontal lobes with 10811.11, and the parietal lobes with 8960.11 voxels. The cerebellum also demonstrated activation with a mean voxel activation of 5633.89.<br><br>The occipital lobe activation correlated with the visual component of the test. Frontal lobe activation was associated with focused attention and reasoning. Parietal lobe activation related to visual and sensory input, eye movements and visual stimuli. <br><br>Benefits of this research include improvement in neurosurgical planning and treatment decisions by locating tumors and determining what areas may be damaged in surgery. It can assist health care providers in further exploring brain functions and the manner in which different lobes of the brain affect various parts of the body.

THE EFFECTS OF CINNAMOMUM CASSIA ON GLUCOSE UPTAKE
Ashley Nicole Hoehn
Ottoville High School, Ottoville, OH

Diabetes has become one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Cinnamomum cassia can be used to decrease the glucose levels of type II diabetics. How long does it take cinnamon to lower glucose levels, and in what way is this happening? <br><br> If Cinnamomum cassia lowers the glucose levels of type II diabetics, then this result may either be from an instantaneous effect which aides the entry of glucose into the cell, a change in metabolic enzyme levels, or both. This researcher hypothesized that the cinnamon has an instantaneous effect of allowing glucose to enter cells. <br><br> This experiment was designed to see if instantaneous transport could be identified in eighteen type II diabetics and in an E. coli model. Nine of the type II diabetics took a cinnamon capsule daily, while the remaining diabetics took a placebo capsule daily. They all recorded their glucose levels daily, and the trends in their glucose levels were analyzed. In the second experiment, the amounts of ferrocyanide in E. coli cells were measured; these amounts directly correlate to the amount of glucose transferred in the cell. <br><br> This experimenter’s hypothesis was not proven to be true. The data experiment showed that there is, indeed, an initial decrease in glucose levels. However, these levels continued to decrease until the end of the experiment as well. This suggests that cinnamon may affect the metabolic enzyme levels.

NERVE REGENERATION: EMBRYONIC FACTORS PROMOTE ADULT AXON REGROWTH IN A GASTROPOD MODEL
Maria Luisa Rangel
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

Neuron repair in humans begins with the release of nerve growth factors that bind to tyrosine kinase receptors (Tkr). A close relative of Trk is Ltrk found in Lymnaea stagnalis. Its ligand is still unknown but identifying it could lead to new forms of treatment for people with nervous system injuries. This is the first step and the project aimed to regrow the axons on neurons taken from adult snails using the embryonic nerve growth factors found in snail embryos. This was done using neurons taken from the cerebral ganglion of an adult snail and snail eggs at certain stages in their development. A measured solution of neurons were placed in a control dish that contained the medium L-15 and the experimental dish contained equal amounts of neuron solution and the medium L-15 medium as well as a solution of the snail eggs mixed in. These were allowed to sit for two hours before a count was taken of the number of neurons present in each dish and the number of neurons with axons. Pictures of the neurons with axons were taken and they were later measured. A statistical test was performed and the results showed that there was no significant difference in axon length between the two groups but there was a higher difference in the frequency of appearance of axons in the experimental group compared to the control group. This showed that the embryonic nerve growth factors found in snail embryos do aid in the regrowth of axons.

DO AROMATIC OILS AFFECT OFFSPRING GENDER RATIO IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER?
Shaghayegh Saeidi
Cocoa High School, Cocoa, FL

The purpose of this project is to observe and investigate through different experimental procedures whether the three specific aromatic oils: 1) Lavender oil, 2) Tea tree oil, 3) Grape seed oil; affect Drosophila melanogaster’s offspring gender and DNA. Lavender extracts are used in many products like hand soap, lotion, and fabric softener. Young boys who are exposed to it through these substances over a long period of time could develop feminine traits.<br><br> <br><br> Four groups of flies were set up and cultured for 12 generations. Group 1 was the control with no additives. Group 2 was cultured with lavender oil. Group 3 was cultured with tea tree oil. Group 4 was cultured with grape seed oil. Lavender and tea tree oil resulted in greater numbers of female offspring. The grape seed oil compared favorably with the control group with even gender ratios.<br><br> <br><br> In conclusion the hypothesis was supported, due to the fact that the following steps are supported through the experiment:<br><br>1.The fruit flies that were treated with lavender oil and tea tree oil produced 65% females and 35% males.<br><br>2.The fruit flies in the control group and the fruit flies that were treated with grape seed oil did not affect fruit flies in this experiment.

USING INTERFERENCE RNA TO SILENCE CANCER
Jenna Lynne Pappalardo
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

As twelve million new cancer diagnoses occur yearly, the need for efficient and cancer-specific treatments are sought after. Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, kills one million people worldwide every year. Regulator of G-protein signaling 17 (RGS17) may hold a link to the genetic components of lung cancer which maintain malignant cells’ life by creating excess of proteins needed by cancer cells. If RGS17’s role in the cell is blocked by silencer ribonucleic acid (RNA) as it binds to its complementary messenger RNA, then it may slow cancer growth. <br><br> Both non-small cell and squamous cell lung cancer cells were used for testing. A breast cancer cell line, with no known correlation to RGS17, was used as a basis for cells’ reactions to the treatment with normal levels of RGS17. Due to RNA’s negative charge, a transfection reagent was needed to allow the molecule to enter the phospholipid bilayer. Lipids, a safe and effective vector, create an aqueous sphere around the RNA and allow it entrance to the cell. Two days after transfection a microplate reader was utilized to monitor the viability of the cells and RNA was harvested for analysis of RGS17’s involvement.<br><br> Cell analyses demonstrated that the squamous cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer lines had significantly lower cell numbers in treatment groups than control groups. RNA analyses through reverse transcriptase and real-time PCR showed reduced levels of RGS17 in treatment groups compared to controls. The most dramatic reduction occurred in the squamous cells.

MIXING PRESCRIPTIONS? THE INACTIVATION OF TAMOXIFEN BY SSRIS ON LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATUS
Nikki Marie Schmidt
Merino High School, Merino, CO

The purpose of this research project was to investigate the effects of Lexapro (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) antidepressant on Tamoxifen’s ability to regenerate Lumbriculus variegatus. For the procedure the dosages of Tamoxifen and Lexapro were determined. Once solutions were mixed each was added to a microcentrifuge tube to the 0.5 ml mark. For the mix of Tamoxifen and Lexapro 0.25 ml of each was added to the tubes. The worms were cut into three pieces and each piece was placed in the appropriate tube. They were allowed to regenerate for one week and were measured three times. This was repeated for a second trial. The researcher can conclude that Tamoxifen was affected by Lexapro. The control group in trial 1 and 2 had growth percentages of 22.58% and 47.06% for the head, 20% and 46.73% for the middle, and 17.24% and 26.67% for the tail. In trial 1 and 2 the worms that were exposed to the Tamoxifen had an average growth percent of 50% and -100% for the head, -5.26% and -100% for the middle, and -100% and -100% for the tail. This shows that the Tamoxifen was working and killing the cells. Trial 1 and 2 growths for Lexapro were 40% and 7.32% for the head, 4.17% and 10.26% for the middle, and -35.71% and -0.51% for the tail. The percentages for the Tamoxifen and Lexapro group in trial 1 and 2 were 66.67% and -60% for the head, -9.09% and -21.88% for the middle and -53.57% and -63.64% for the tail. This means the Lexapro interfered with Tamoxifen and prevented it from killing the worms’ cells.

TABLE TROUBLES
Nicole Marie Biddinger
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not indigenous microorganisms and opportunistic pathogens existed on restaurant tables, and if the possible microbes on the surfaces could transfer to resting silverware. Analytical data was collected from three different tests: test one incorporated the use of a sterile swab directly on the surface of a restaurant table, with the exception of the control, which was a pre-cleaned table. Test two involved swabbing individually packaged eating utensils prior to placement on the table, to verify that the utensils were clean before contact with the table's surface. Test three swabbed the same utensil after placement on the table for a constant time of fifteen seconds. Ten restaurants were tested, using the above methods, with the exception of the pre-cleaned table for the control. The results showed that 90% of the restaurants had microorganisms on the table, and 77.8% of these tables were able to transfer microorganisms to the utensils. The control tests were clean, supporting that it is possible for restaurants to have clean tables. The microorganisms found from the experimentation included Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Mucor, Micrococcus, and Streptomycete. <br><br><br>To prevent this occurrence in the future, restaurant cleaning regulations should be enforced or better implemented, and restaurants could use one-use wipes to clean the tables. In addition, paper and disposable placemats also offer solutions to preventing the spread of microorganisms on restaurant tables.

FERTILITY BOOSTER: A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA JACK ON ESTROUS CYCLE OF FEMALE RATS: A NEW HOPE FOR THE INFERTILITIES
Muhammad Adib Abas
Sultan Mohamad Jiwa Science Secondary School, Sungai Petani, Kedah, MALAYSIA

The objectives of this project are to investigate the effect of the standardised extract of E. longifolia JACK (TAF 273) on the estrous cycle (EC) of normal adult female rats and the effect of TAF 273 on irregular EC female rats induced by testosterone(T).<br><br>A group of normal adult female rats (8-10 weeks old) with regular EC were orally fed for 3 weeks with 50 mg/kg/day of TAF 273 (n = 8) while the control group was orally fed with vehicle (distilled water;n=8). The number of days of each four phases of the EC were monitored during the 3 weeks in the two groups by vaginal lavage followed by microscopic examination. <br><br>3 weeks old immature female rats (n = 20) were given T 10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously for 3 weeks to induce irregular EC. At the end of the 3 weeks, the rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 10) were orally fed with 50 mg/kg/day of TAF 273 for 3 weeks (T + TAF 273-treated). Group 2 (n = 10) were orally fed with vehicle for 3 weeks (T-treated). Group 3 (n = 10) was given vehicle for 3 + 3 weeks (control). <br><br>The results indicate that 3 weeks treatment of 50 mg/kg/day TAF 273 did not affect the regularity of the EC in normal adult female rats. However, the diestrus phase period was significantly extended when compared to the control group. TAF 273 (50 mg/kg/day) is able to significantly reverse testosterone-induced irregular EC after 2 weeks of treatment.

YWHAZ (14-3-3ZETA) INVOLVED IN THE METASTASIS OF LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA THROUGH WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY
Tsung-Han Chan
National Taichung First Senior High School, Taichung City, Taiwan, CHINESE TAIPEI

Recently, YWHAZ(14-3-3zeta) protein has been reported to promote various cancer, such as colon cancer, breast cancer. However, there’s no one proving that YWHAZ is involved in lung adenocarcinoma. In our previous study, a cDNA microarray was performed to detect the oncogenes expression in the different situations between low and high migration lung adenocarcinoma cells. YWHAZ was found by us for the obivious expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that YWHAZ might play a crucial role in lung adenocarcinoma.<br><br> We demonstrated that when lung cancer cells overexpressed YWHAZ by transfection with YWHAZ clone, the cell increased the migration, invasion and cell proliferation. And we also found an increase of beta-catenin, the key protein of Wnt signaling pathway, in the cells while the overexpression of YWHAZ. Then, we observed accidentally that YWHAZ is associated with the nuclear activity of Wnt, such as c-myc. Finally, the same expression of YWHAZ was found in the advanced specimens of lung adenocarcinoma. With these findings, we proposed that YWHAZ could involve in the metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma and induce it through Wnt signaling pathway.

IDENTIFICATION OF BIOLOGICAL INSECT-LARVICIDES
Joao Batista de Castro David Junior
Colegio Estadual Liceu de Maracanau, Maracanau, CE, BRASIL

Nowadays, dengue virus diseases spreads causing major epidemics and bringing damage to the world population. Control methods of Aedes aegypti become ineffective in the face of resistance developed by the insects, and pesticides pollute the environment if used improperly. Therefore it is important to identify alternative methods, effective and biodegradable, insect-larvicides to combat this plague. My main objective is to develop a method of control of A. aegypti that surpasses conventional methods in three main aspects: effectiveness, cost and environmental. First, I characterized the active ingredients of the aqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica (Neem), Carapa guianensis (Andiroba), Mentha crispa (mint) and Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco). I then analyzed them using chromatography gas with mass detector and spectrometry (GC/MS). I evaluated the extracts in 3rd stage larvae of A. aegypti in laboratory conditions. The extract produced from Neem leaves was the most effective. Then I concentrated the extract to reduce dilution and increase efficiency. The extracts were also evaluated on egg-laying by females Aedes aegypti, which registered a decrease. These substrates are a good alternative for the preventive control of this pest in colonies of dengue mosquitoes because of its insect-larvicide effect, low cost and high availability. The analysis of production cost and effectiveness showed that the natural bio-controller produced from the Neem extract is as effective as pesticides produced synthetically. These pesticides include semimetals and metals in their composition, which pollute and remain indefinitely in the environment. The product developed was able to achieve its goals, resulting in a research platform for future improvements.

THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION IN MURINE EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS
Jahanzeb Kaikaus
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a constellation of neurological, craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities, occurs with increased frequency in offspring of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. FAS has very significant public health implications. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FAS are largely unknown. Epigenetic alterations, primarily in DNA methylation of cytosine/guanine pairs (CpG) in promoter region of the genes crucial for normal mammalian development, may well be operational in the genesis of this syndrome. The present study tests the hypothesis that alcohol alters i) DNA methylation and the expression of genes involved in DNA methylation, and ii) the expression of genes important in the development of structures affected in FAS in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs, grown in culture, demonstrated ~20% reduction in global DNA methylation following exposure to 200 mM ethanol. This observation was supported by diminished immunofluorescent staining of ethanol-exposed MEFs with an anti-5-methyl-cytosine antibody. In QRT-PCR analyses, expression of the gene for DNA methyltransferase-1, as well as for genes encoding methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, Mbd-2 and Mbd-3, was significantly reduced following ethanol exposure. Expression of genes encoding other critically important proteins involved in embryonic development, such as Sox9, Sox10, and MMP-9, was significantly altered as well. These data demonstrate that ethanol induces changes in global DNA methylation, alters expression of genes involved in DNA methylation, and affects expression of several genes crucial for embryogenesis, in MEFs. Overall, this study presents important and novel experimental findings towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FAS.

PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A: A PROSPECTIVE TARGET FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS
Jacob Reeh
Orestad Gymnasium, Copenhagen, DENMARK

The main aim of this project was to synthesize a small amount of a biotinylated drug with the chemical properties of a PDE10A inhibitor. The use of PDE10A inhibitors in the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia may improve the efficacy towards many of the symptoms that characterize schizophrenia. By attaching biotin to a PDE10A inhibitor molecule, it may be possible to assess which adverse effects the use of the inhibitor can cause if the inhibitor is used as an antipsychotic drug. <br><br>Biotin was attached to the synthesized inhibitor during a substitution reaction. By using a mass spectrometer in tandem with a liquid chromatograph, it was confirmed that a sufficient quantity of PDE10A inhibitor molecules had been successfully biotinylated.

ASSESSMENT OF POTASSIUM BROMATE CONCENTRATIONS IN BREAD: A COMMONLY USED PRESERVATIVE WITH CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL
Antonio Francisco Rivera Viscal
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Potassium Bromate is a chemical agent known to cause cancer of the kidneys, thyroid gland, and peritoneum in rats. It’s carcinogenic potential in humans has been conﬁrmed in multiple scientific studies, and by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In addition, acute potassium bromate intoxication (0.74 mg / 37g to 37 mg/g) may result in deafness, renal failure, and anemia according to clinical reports. Potassium bromate was widely used in bread making until the late twentieth century since it increases bread volume, texture, and consistency. Then, studies carried out by Drs. Kurokawa and DeAngelo reported bromateʼs carcinogenic potential. Once these studies where disseminated by the International Agency for Cancer Investigation, most international health organizations banned its use for human consumption. However, although Canada, United Nations, and the Dominican Republic have prohibited the use of this substance, it has not been banned in the United States or Puerto Rico. In the present study, bromate content was measured in various samples of Puerto Rican and US manufactured bread using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bread samples (between 30 and 40 grams) where collected, and shipped for testing in a commercial laboratory. The bromate amounts measured were then normalized and reported as mg per 37g; in order to eliminate sample weight discrepancies. We found that bromate content was: 134.9+11.9 mg / 37g for breads made in Puerto Rico and 129.9+2.5 mg/ 37g (Means+SD), for breads made in the United States. These results suggest that breads consumed in the United States and Puerto Rico have bromate levels greater than those that are considered safe for human consumption. Studies indicate that the ingestion of significantly less quantities of bromate than those found in either US and Puerto Rican bread may result in serious and even life threatening conditions such as cancer and renal failure.

DENDRITIC SPINES: A WINDOW INTO THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASDS)
June Xuejun Sun
Laramie High School, Laramie, WY

Background. Dendritic spines are the structural underpinning of cognition and neural plasticity. They are regulated by brain deprived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Dendritic pathologies are linked to Rett syndrome, Fragile-X syndrome, and other ASDs. My goal is to study a key molecular mechanism involved in coupling neuronal activity with developmental regulation of dendritic spines in vivo. <br><br>Methods. I obtained brain tissue samples, where single neurons were labeled with neurobiotin during patch-clamp studies by QS. The tissue samples were obtained by the QS and were separated into wild-type (WT) mice and knock-in (KIV-/-) mice, in which activity dependent synthesis of BDNF from promoter-IV has been genetically removed. Each neuron was catalogued into one of four groups described in research methods. I carried out the project by firstly using the Neurolucida program to digitally reconstruct the entire 3-D dendritic structure of each labeled neuron. Next, I used mathematical and statistical analysis to compare the morphometric properties of dendrites and dendritic spines in each group. <br><br>Results. Spine density was significantly reduced by sensory deprivation in WT by not KIV-/- tissue. 2. Spine density and dendritic branching were significantly reduced in KIV-/- tissue. This study uncovered an important role of promoter -IV of the BDNF gene in neurodevelopmental related disorders, such as ASD.<br><br>Conclusion. My research has led to a paper that proposes using KIV-/- mice as a novel animal model for understanding shared mechanisms of ASDs. These results could potentially help develop new treatment strategies for these disorders.

NOVEL ROLE OF PARP-4 AS A POTENTIAL TARGET IN BREAST CANCER
Olga Y. Skirda
Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Estrogen-mediated actions play an important role in the development and pathophysiology of breast tissues. Approximately 75% of breast cancer patients respond well to endocrine therapies. Although systemic hormone therapy that either blocks local estrogen production by aromatase inhibitors (AI), or blocks actions of estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) by antiestrogens (AE) is well tolerated, the development of resistance to these agents is a major concern. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) comprises of a family of enzymes which catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl) action of DNA-binding proteins. PARP-4 is an understudied protein with numerous capabilities. The purpose of this experiment is to elucidate PARP-4 on hormonal metastasis. It is hypothesized that PARP-4 acts as a co-regulator to ER to increase cancer cell proliferation and migration.<br><br> MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, transfected with a PARP-4 vector to allow for the over-expression of PARP-4, was obtained by the mentor. The cells were used to test whether the induction of PARP-4 contributed to the in vitro proliferation, migration, and colony formation potential of the MCF-7 cells. <br><br> MCF-7/PARP-4 cells increased ER-alpha expression by two-fold, when compared to parent MCF-7 cells. The colony formation assay showed that PARP-4 increased the in vitro tumorigenic potential of MCF-7 cells. The colony count in MCF-7/PARP-4 cells was 30, compared to 9 smaller colonies of MCF-7 cells. The migration assay results shows 55% of MCF-7/PARP-4 cells migrated to the wounded site, compared to MCF-7 cells at 5%. In conclusion, the data supports the hypothesis that PARP-4 acts as a co-regulator to estrogen to increase cell proliferation and migration, and that ER-PARP-4 may be a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.

IMPROVING THE LONG-TERM FUNCTIONALITY OF INTRACORTICAL ELECTRODES: UNDERSTANDING AND MITIGATING ASTROGLIOSIS IN REACTIVE BRAIN TISSUE
Ashley Marie Sankari
Jefferson High School, Lafayette, IN

The development of intracortical electrodes has far-reaching medical applications. These electrodes can be used to replace a sensory function lost due to spinal cord injury or other neurological condition. While these electrode devices are efficient in restoring function, they have yet to obtain main stream application in humans because they lack the long-term functionality that is necessary. When the electrode is first implanted, the blood-brain barrier is broken. This initiates a healthy immune response that results in the electrode being covered with a dense layer of astrocytes. While this barrier is present, little to no communication can be made between the device and the neurons, rendering the electrode useless. It is possible that DC fields can be used to mitigate the astrocyte barrier around the electrode by rearranging the cells in a way that is conducive to the reestablishment of communication between the electrode device and neurons. In this study, the effect of DC fields on E17 cortical astrocytes was investigated. The results of this study found that the astrocytes, when subjected to a field strength of 500mV, appear to be aligned perpendicular to the DC field gradient, an arrangement that could possibly mitigate the immunoresponse of cortical astrocytes post electrode implantation.

THE EFFECTS OF EPOXYEICOSATRIENOIC ACIDS AND THEIR METABOLITES ON MYOCARDIAL FUNCTION AND PERFUSION DURING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA
Matthew A. Nugent
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

This study examined the effects of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and dihydroepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) on regional function and perfusion in a model of acute myocardial ischemia. EETs are generally accepted as vasodilators, HETEs as vasoconstrictors, and DHETs as inactive EETs metabolites. It was hypothesized that EETs have a vasodilator role in maintenance of myocardial blood flow (MBF) within the autoregulatory range and that 14,15-EET potentiates perfusion during acute ischemia. The student researcher collected blood from the great coronary vein (local/regional), coronary sinus (myocardial), and inferior vena cava (systemic). A qualified technician measured plasma levels of EETs, HETEs, and DHETs using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry sequence (LC-MS/MS). As coronary artery pressure (CAP) decreased within the autoregulatory range, regional function did not change, and myocardial blood volume fraction (MBV) increased significantly while red blood cell velocity and MCE-derived MBF remained unchanged. There was no relation between CAP and regional and systemic EET or DHET levels within the autoregulatory range. However, as CAP decreased, regional and systemic 15-HETE levels and regional 12-HETE levels also decreased, suggesting that the increase in MBV fraction was mediated by a reduction in HETE-mediated vasoconstriction. In addition, a strong positive correlation was found between all arachidonic acid metabolites tested in the local and systemic circulation, suggesting that both local and systemic sources may play a role during acute myocardial ischemia. During acute ischemia, resulting in a reduction of regional myocardial function and perfusion, exogenous 14,15-EET infusion resulted in an increase in MBV fraction and MBF.

THE NOVEL USE OF FLUORESCENCE RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER (FRET) TO OBSERVE APOPTOSIS IN OLIGODENDROCYTES
Pragya Kakani
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

In order to overcome shortcomings of immunohistochemical techniques used to detect apoptosis, a fluorescent protein expression vector relying on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been generated which allows for the continuous observation of apoptotic cell death. The purpose of this study is to test the ability protein expression vector, pCFP-DEVD-YFP, to observe oligodendrocyte apoptosis. The vector was generated through PCR amplification of ECFP and EYFP, and ligation in pcDNA3.1. Then DH5-alpha E.coli cells were transformed with CFP-DEVD-YFP fusion protein expression vectors to clone the vector. Extracted pCFP-DEVD-YFP was used to transfect human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and PC12 cells to ensure the viability and sustainability of the vector. Then glial cultures containing oligodendrocyte were transfected, and apoptosis was observed through exposure to staurosporine. Cell death was observed from 0-4 hours through confocal microscopy. YFP excitement by CFP decreased by 53.0% suggesting that apoptosis was successfully detected through FRET. The results demonstrate that FRET can be used as a novel means to observe oligodendrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, the findings provide a basis for developing a ROSA26 reporter mouse to visualize oligodendrocyte apoptosis in vivo using non-invasive means. These techniques may be applied to address unanswered questions related to oligodendrocyte apoptosis, specifically in relation to multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI).

INHIBITION OF VASCULAR CELL MIGRATION BY BISDEMETHOXYCURCUMIN: A BIOINFORMATICS BASED APPROACH TO IDENTIFY TARGET GENES
Shalini Ramanan
Hanford High School, Richland, WA

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated cell-migration and proliferation are key pathological events in a variety of disease including atherosclerosis and cancer. Curcumin derived from the spice Turmeric has been attributed to have beneficial effects in a variety of cancers and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that bisdemethoxycurcumin (BC), a derivative of curcumin (C) is a potent inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the mechanisms responsible for the anti-migratory effects of BC have not been fully understood. <br><br> <br><br>The objectives of my study are : i) To investigate the effects of BC on PDGF-mediated smooth muscle signaling, and ii) To identify the potential gene targets of BC in modulating PDGF signaling. <br><br> <br><br>Effect of C and BC on PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGF-receptor beta was determined by Western Blotting of the cell lysates from PDGF (10 ng/mL, 10 min)-stimulated VSMCs in the presence of C and BC. Bioinformatics and literature mining tools like CTD, Pubgene, NCBI, STRING, Chilibot, Medie, Gene Ontology Finder and FatiGO were used to identify potential gene targets and biological processes that are affected by BC. <br><br> <br><br>BC was more potent than C in inhibiting PDGF-stimulated PDGF-receptor phosphorylation. BC may be mediating its effects by inhibiting PDGF-mediated signaling in VSMCs. Insilico experiments identified number of genes that are affected by BC in relation to its effects on PDGF-stimulated migration. In addition, the higher potency of BC to inhibit PDGF-signaling and its better solubility profile compared to C makes it a better candidate for future studies.

SEQUENCE SIMILARITY BETWEEN ROTAVIRUS AND INSULIN-REGULATING GENES
Mary Olivia Richardson
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Insulin production in genetically susceptible humans could potentially be silenced by rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus, through RNA interference (RNAi). Rotavirus is the leading cause of infantile gastroenteritis worldwide and has been associated with the onset of type 1 diabetes. Significant genetic similarity between rotavirus and insulin-regulating genes could indicate that a portion of rotavirus may function as a short interfering RNA (siRNA), the mediator of RNAi. Sequences of diabetes-associated rotavirus segments and insulin-regulating target genes were obtained, and a bioinformatics site was used to test for similarity between each virus gene and each target gene. There exists sufficient genetic similarity in five matches, supporting the proposal that rotavirus and insulin-regulating genes harbor areas of similarity. Based on this similarity, it is possible for rotavirus to be a cause of type 1 diabetes through RNAi.

EXPRESSION PROFILING OF PUTATIVE MICRORNA IN EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER
Samantha Brooke Halpern
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal cancer of all gynecologic malignancies. Its high mortality rate is due to the inability to detect EOC in early stages prior to the development of its characteristic widespread distant metastases. Therefore, it is essential to identify bio-molecules that regulate EOC metastasis. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short 21-23 nucleotide sequences that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Previous studies have implicated miRNAs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. However, few studies have defined the role of miRNAs in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype. This study compared the miRNA profiles of an EOC cell line and a normal ovarian surface epithelium in order to identify those miRNAs that may play a role in EOC metastases. DOV13, a highly invasive EOC cell line, and IOSE-29, an immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cell line, were grown in monolayers for subsequent RNA extraction, miRNA enrichment, and a cancer-related miRNA qPCR array. The array contained 88 primers for miRNAs suspected to play a role in tumor development. 5 miRNAs were identified that were significantly up-regulated in the carcinoma cell line (miRs- 126, -135b, -138, -181d, and -363) and 2 miRNAs (miRs- 146a, and -134) were significantly down-regulated. Although further investigation is needed to identify the specific role that each identified miRNA plays in EOC progression, these findings help elucidate the miRNA profile unique to DOV13 and thus have suggested new potential therapeutic targets affecting EOC metastasis.

CASPASE DEPENDENT APOPTOTIC PATHWAYS IN HCT-116 COLON CANCER CELLS
Jessica Taylor Lovett
Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway, Cedarhurst, NY

In multi-cellular organisms, the mitochondria, the center of cell survival and programmed cell death, ensures that there is a balance between cells produced by mitosis and cells destroyed by apoptosis. An interruption in this balance can lead to the proliferation of cells and contribute to cancer. Two pathways are associated with apoptosis: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Both result in the activation of caspases, which take part in a proteolytic cascade, ultimately leading to cell death. Past research suggests that cancer cells neglect to carry out the complete apoptotic process. <br><br> This research examines new drugs to target the inactive caspases in cancer cells. HCT-116 colon cancer cells were treated with etoposide, imatinib, and sorafenib. Moreover, this project examines whether there is a defect in cytochrome-c release in cancer cells, and if this release is related to caspase activation. This project proves that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis can occur simultaneously, and that there are certain inhibitors preventing the completion of apoptosis. Results from caspase assays and western blots indicate that there is a defect in cytochrome-c release in colon cancer cells. In addition, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, such as sorafenib and imatinib effectively induced apoptosis, while the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, did not produce significant results. Future treatments need to focus on bypassing the initial steps of apoptosis while inducing caspase activation and ensuring that cytochrome-c is released from the mitochondria.

THE DOUBLE LIFE OF HTERT: IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL FUNCTION AND AN EXPLANATION OF MECHANISM INVOLVING THE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR
Linda Zhou
Academy for Medical Science Technology, Hackensack, NJ

The goal of this experiment was to elucidate a novel telomere independent function of hTERT, the catalytic component of telomerase, involving the interplay between hTERT, the epidermal growth factor receptor and its ligand, hypoxia induced drug resistance. shRNA was used to knock down hTERT mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, an aggressive, triple negative breast cancer line. A modified Boyden chamber invasion assay showed that silencing hTERT significantly inhibited the cell’s known positive chemotactic response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). An enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) performed for evaluation of the activation of the EGFR showed that hTERT knockdown results in lower levels of total and activated EGFR independent of EGF ligand binding. In addition, the effect of silencing hTERT on hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated. The MTS assay for cell viability demonstrated for hTERT knockdown cells, hypoxic conditions provided no resistance or proliferative advantage, with cisplatin demonstrating the same rate of effectiveness as in cells grown in normoxia, while hTERT positive cells show significant resistance to cisplatin in hypoxia. Timing of the experiment excludes telomerase activity as an explanation. Previous literature demonstrated that cisplatin resistance is related to EGFR activation, independent of EGF ligand binding. Thus, the identification of a relationship between hTERT and the EGFR supplements the original additional findings of this study that silencing hTERT mRNA expression can mediate hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance independent of telomere length, suggesting both a possible treatment for drug resistant breast cancer tumors and a novel explanation for mechanism of action.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FROM GARLIC TO TREAT MALIGNANT HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME BRAIN TUMORS
Se Woong Jeong
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke, VA

Although the incidences of brain tumors are low each year, when diagnosed, the tumors tend to be very severe; a majority of patients will die within two years. To start, it was hypothesized that the natural constituents of garlic will destroy the tumor cells.<br><br>The oil and the aqueous based raw garlic extracts were prepared and tested to the brain tumor cells. Also, two specific compounds from garlic, diallyl sulfide (DAS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), screened out from chemical analyses of garlic, was purchased and tested. On the first day of cell culturing, the U87MG malignant human glioblastoma multiforme tumor cells were seeded on 96 well plates in vitro. On the next day, the tumor cells were dosed with the garlic extracts or with the compounds DAS or DATS. On the final day, the number of viable cells was observed with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay.<br><br>Surprisingly, the 100% concentration of oil based raw garlic extract destroyed all the tumor cells as well as 100% and 10% aqueous garlic extract. The 1% aqueous garlic preparation killed approximately half of the tumor cells and 0.1% aqueous garlic juice did not kill any cells. On the other hand, even at low concentrations, the compound DATS effectively killed the tumor cells. In this study, the hypothesis was accepted as garlic showed therapeutic effects. Although more trials must be done, the study supports the notion that natural ingredients, such as garlic components, are powerful against diseases such as cancer.<br><br>Currently, the changes to the U87MG brain tumor genome are studied through the Affymetrix GeneChip with the therapeutic agent of garlic oil. The results are pending.

NOVEL IDENTIFICATION/SUBJUGATION OF PROSTATE CANCER CELLS' INTRINSIC RESISTANCE MECHANISM TO CISPLATIN
Jong Hyuck Won
Langley High School, McLean, VA

Strong intrinsic resistance of prostate cancer (PCa) cells against Cisplatin, the most widely used cancer chemotherapy treatment, has brought a serious difficulty in treating prostate cancer. This report identifies two novel mechanisms for intrinsic cisplatin-resistance of two types of PCa cell lines: first, PC3 type cells develop resistance by preventing caspase-3 activation with their effective DNA repair (NER) ability of the damage caused by Cisplatin, avoiding apoptosis. Second, for LNCaP type cells, this study proposes a new identified role of PCPH/mt-PCPH protein in antagonizing the cisplatin-induced apoptotic process by activating PKCa – Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pathway, ultimately rendering LNCaP cells apoptotic-resistance that is much stronger than that of PC3 cells.<br><br> Furthermore, this study reports a novel Cisplatin treatment strategy that involves Cisplatin’s synergistic combinations with natural substances: Menadione (vitamin K3), and (–)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) green tea antioxidant. Such combinative treatment not only alleviated the toxicity of Cisplatin on normal cells, but also induced significant synergism in its apoptotic anti-cancer effect on cancer cells by specifically targeting their two resistance mechanisms identified here. For PC3 cells, the addition of menadione, but not EGCG, inhibited their DNA repair ability, forcing apoptosis. For LNCaP cells, both menadione and EGCG significantly down-regulated PCPH/mt-PCPH protein, blocking the overall PKCa – Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pathway to create pro-apoptotic condition that sensitizes PCa cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. With reduced toxicity and enhanced sensitivity, this new strategic cisplatin treatment could seriously improve current clinical treatment for prostate cancer patients.

ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FLU VACCINE: A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY
Shambavi Sadayappan
Village Academy, Powell, OH

According to the CDC, every year over 200,000 people in the USA are hospitalized and tens of thousands of people die due to influenza and its complications. The main method of prevention of the flu is the influenza vaccine. However, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine has recently come under scrutiny from the science community. <br><br>Recently, the CDC published an article which stated that the Vaccine Advisory Committee had considered altering the influenza vaccine structure completely in order to prevent failures, but decided against it due to insufficient data. This project provides data and results, which show not only the inefficiency of the current three-strain influenza vaccine, but which also show clear trends that indicate a marked increase in efficiency of a four-strain vaccine. <br><br>This project uses genomic data and comparison tools to test the effectiveness of the vaccine and to determine whether there is a large enough separation between the Influenza B lineages to allow the addition of another strain to the vaccine, to make it more efficient. Two approaches are used in this study. The first uses genomic comparison tools to compare contracted viruses against the current three-strain vaccine as well as the hypothetical four-strain vaccine. The other approach takes advantage of clustering software to illustrate the large separation found between the two lineages of Influenza B. Data from the past three flu seasons indicate that there is a significant difference between lineages, and the addition of another Influenza B strain to the vaccine would increase effectiveness.

HIGH CHOLESTEROL IMPAIRS WATER AND GAS TRANSPORT IN RED BLOOD CELLS AND IS AMELIORATED BY THE PLA2 INHIBITOR ONO-RS-082
Siddhartha Gautama Jena
International Academy, Bloomfield Hills, MI

Elevated levels of plasma cholesterol pose significant health risks, and are causal to diseases including angina, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes, resulting in more than half a million deaths in the United States alone. Although the long-term effect of elevated plasma cholesterol is known for its accretion in arterial walls, little is understood of its immediate effects. Since cholesterol levels in red blood cells (RBC) membrane are inversely associated with O2 transport, and the RBC water channel AQP1 is also capable of transporting CO2, the detrimental effect of cholesterol on active water transport, and likely on the CO2 and O2 transport in RBC was hypothesized and tested in the present study. Studies were carried out using isolated rat RBC. The rapid gating of water into RBC and the corresponding increase in volume and surface area was determined using dynamic light scattering. Similarly, the entry of CO2 into the RBC was determined using Zeta potential measurements, as increase in intracellular acidity reduced the negative charge at the RBC membrane. Results from my study demonstrate for the first time that the immediate effect of elevated plasma cholesterol is dysfunction of active water and CO2 transport via the AQP1 channel at the RBC membrane. Since there is growing evidence that PLA2 may play a key role in atherogenesis, and statins significantly reduce blood PLA2 levels, the effect of the PLA2 inhibitor on ameliorating the detrimental effects of cholesterol was investigated. Interestingly, the PLA2 inhibitor ONO-RS-082 was found to reverse cholesterol effect on RBC function.

IMPROVING STETHOSCOPE HYGIENE AT TWO COMMUNITY HOSPITALS
Ariel Lynne Schroeder
Saint Joseph High School, Natrona Heights, PA

The purpose of the study was to see if a simple educational intervention on the simultaneous use of alcohol hand gel to cleanse hands and stethoscopes could increase stethoscope hygiene in actual clinical settings. After IRB approval was obtained, 167 stethoscopes from various clinical areas of two community hospitals including inpatient wards, emergency and urgicare departments, as well as outpatient health centers were marked with individual random numbered tags for the duration of the study. Only the role of the stethoscope owner and the unit number were recorded, and files were kept by an honest broker to ensure blinding of the data. Stethoscopes were cultured by imprinting directly onto random numbered chocolate agar plates and incubated for 48 hours. Number and type of bacterial colonies were counted, gram staining, and various enzyme determination was performed. Cultures were repeated three times before the educational intervention. The intervention was staged at all testing sites utilizing posters, PowerPoint, e-mail newsletters, and rotating screensavers on computers in clinical areas. Stethoscopes were re-cultured at one week, three weeks, seven weeks, eleven weeks, and fifteen weeks post-intervention. The change in average colony counts before and after intervention for individual stethoscopes was calculated and statistical analysis performed. The mean bacterial counts were statistically decreased for all months post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. (p < .05) and week 15 post-intervention was also statistically decreased from week one. Hand washing compliance increased and nosocomial infection rates decreased at both sites during the course of the study.

FACTORS AFFECTING THE PRESCRIPTION VOLUME (V100) OF THE TANDEM/RING HDR APPLICATOR
Anirudh Krishna
Solon High School, Solon, OH

Problem: The goal of this study was to model the variance of the V100 – a measure of volume of tissue receiving at least 100% of the prescribed dose of radiation – in a cervical cancer model after manipulating variables relating to source placement and quantity in High Dose Rate brachytherapy. If the variance were too high, quality treatment could not be assured for patients, endangering proximate rectal and bladder tissue. It was hypothesized that rotating, and increasing the distance between dose coordinates and putting emphasis on either the ring or tandem of the applicator, would have a significant (+/- 5%) effect on the V100. <br><br> Methods: A computer model was created to model and manipulate various types of ring/tandem applicators, distances between dose points, and ring/tandem source ratios. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to analyze differences between similar source arrangements. Regression analysis was conducted on all ‘rotation’ data sets. <br><br> Results/Conclusions: V100 variation was quadratic at less than 30° rotation, and was less than +/-5% during variable manipulation. Applicators with emphasis on ring sources had a positive correlation with V100, but the resulting V100 variance was not enough to exceed the +/- 5% error deemed as acceptable for quality cancer treatment. The unlikely event of a 2mm deviation from normal in dose point distances had a potentially deleterious effect on the V100 and proximate tissue irradiation. It was determined that in common clinical scenarios, V100 varies predictably with different factors but not significantly enough to transgress the +/-5% variation benchmark.

CRITICAL ROLE OF TGFB1/SMAD3 SIGNALING IN HEPATIC METABOLISM: A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME
Samirkumar S Devalaraja
Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School, Rockville, MD

Both the prevalence and severity of the metabolic syndrome have skyrocketed due to the sedentary nature of modern lifestyle. The liver plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome in part through gluconeogenesis, which results in elevated blood sugar levels. Although TGF-b1/SMAD3 interactions are known to regulate cell growth, survival and cell death, their role in influencing metabolic syndrome is a recent observation and is poorly understood. TGF-b1/SMAD3 signaling has previously been shown to play roles in pancreatic b-cell development and adipose tissue function. Using SMAD3 deficient mice, we sought to understand the role of TGF-b1/SMAD3 signaling in hepatic glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. We reconfirmed that SMAD3 deficiency improves key global phenotypic measures of metabolic syndrome. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that SMAD3 deficiency enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, protects from high fat diet induced hepatic steatosis and results in stark improvement in the transcriptional profile of lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism genes. These results clearly suggest that modulation of SMAD3 can be a promising novel therapeutic approach to treat metabolic syndrome.

THE AFFECT OF CONTRAST DENSITY AND MIXING PROCEDURE ON LAYERING OF CONTRAST IN MYELOGRAPHY: AN IN VITRO MODEL
Jacob Harris Miller
Mamaroneck High School, Mamaroneck, NY

Myelography is an imaging technique that involves the injection of radio-opaque contrast (“x-ray dye”) into the thecal sac surrounding the spinal cord and nerves, in order to detect stenosis (narrowing) of the central canal and to determine if the stenosis is caused by disc herniation, ligament thickening, or bone spurs. The contrast medium, Iohexol, comes in different densities: Omnipaque 180 which contains 180 mg I/ml, and Omnipaque 300 which contains 300 mg I/ml. The purpose of our study is to determine if there is a difference in layering between the different densities of contrast, and to determine the most effective method of contrast mixing and the time it takes for the contrast to layer. Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is the experimental model for cerebrospinal fluid. Two different spine models were used. In the first model, two 20cc syringes were used. The second model was a life size glass tube that reproduces the lumbar and thoracic curves of the human spine. The models were rotated about varying degrees to determine which method for mixing contrast and cerebrospinal fluid was most effective, and were then measured over an interval of five minutes to determine if layering occured.

SMALL HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC FOR EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS: A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Dave Raj Praharaj
Virgil I. Grissom High School, Huntsville, AL

In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), immune cells infiltrate the myelin of the brain and cause inflammation to occur, which causes oligodendrocyte death to occur and leads to impairment and loss of neuronal signaling. Recently, alpha B crystallin (cryab, HSPB5), a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, has been shown to play a role in MS. Mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the predominant mouse model of MS, that were treated with cryab showed significantly ameliorated EAE compared to mice treated with a negative control. Since alpha B crystallin is just one of ten mammalian small heat shock proteins, we decided to investigate the therapeutic potential of the whole sHSP family. In this project, the therapeutic effect of nine sHSPs on EAE was assessed: B1 (Hsp27), B2 (MKBP), B3, B4 (alpha A crystallin or cryaa), B5 (alpha B crystallin or cryab), B6 (Hsp20), B7, B8 (Hsp22), and B9. With the exception of HSPB6, all the other sHSPs were therapeutic in EAE. To understand the structure-function relationship between sHSPs and their therapeutic effects, peptide fragments taken from the HSP20 chaperone activity domain of sHSPs B1 and B4 (cryaa) and tested in EAE. In this project, mice induced with EAE and treated with peptide forms of the sHSPs by the qualifierd scientist (QS) showed amelioration of EAE. To further characterize the mechanism of action, ELISAS and proliferation assays were conducted to assess the effects of the sHSPs, particularly cryab, on inflammation and T cell proliferation. Cryab suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production of T cells and T cell proliferation. In conclusion, the ameliorating effects of the sHSPs and their peptides on EAE, along with their immunosuppressive properties, make sHSPs promising therapeutics for MS.

STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF RNA BY THE FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION PROTEIN (FMRP)
Cynthia Chen
The Brearley School, New York, NY

Fragile X Syndrome, the leading inherited cause of mental retardation, is characterized by defective synapses, resulting from loss of function of the Fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, usually due to expansion of CGG repeats within the FMR1 gene. FMRP, an RNA binding protein which regulates the translation of mRNA associated with brain polyribosomes, contains two KH-type RNA binding domains. Attention has focused on the KH2 domain after a missense mutation in this domain, termed I304N, was shown to lead to severe Fragile X Syndrome, underscoring the importance of RNA binding by this domain. While recent studies found that the ligand for KH2 is a “kissing complex” RNA (kcRNA), and demonstrated its physiologic relevance, nothing is known about the mechanism of RNA binding, an important issue as FMRP’s KH2 domain binds a more complex ligand than any KH domain previously described. Here, by site-directed mutagenesis, the FMRP KH2 domain is shown to bind RNA using a novel mechanism likely involving dimerization of the domain. These results, central to understanding the mechanism FMRP KH2 uses to bind RNA and to regulate mRNA translation, lead to greater understanding of how loss of RNA binding by FMRP results in Fragile X Syndrome and subsequent loss of synaptic plasticity and are important for the development of an effective, molecular-based treatment for the disease.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ANGIOGENIC PHENOTYPE IN PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION
Kaylee Danielle Self
Parkway High School, Bossier City, LA

Primary prostate cancer is easily treated with surgery or radiation, but almost one-third of those cases goes on to become metastatic, moving first to the lymph nodes and then to distant organs. This kind of cancer progression is dependent on the recruitment of blood vessels, referred to as angiogenesis. In order to learn more about the effect of prostate cancer cells on angiogenesis, we can use cell line models that represent early and late stages of the disease. We can also use these cell lines to test new therapies that might block angiogenesis. Our goal was to identify angiogenesis-related genes that characterized prostate cancer and to determine molecular targets of two new anti-angiogenesis compounds. Our cell line models are PC3M human prostate cancer cells that will metastasize to many tissues and a variant PC3MLN4 cell line that will metastasize only to the lymph nodes. We have access to novel compounds that can be tested for their effects on the process of angiogenesis. Two of these compounds, ATN-224 and LS122, were used to treat the cell lines and identify secreted pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines and the mRNA was extracted and used to identify other angiogenesis-related genes. A "reporter mouse" carrying a transgene luciferase reporter responsive to NFκB binding was used to measure the ability of the compounds to inhibit NFκB. The results showed that the therapeutic compounds generally decreased levels of angiogenic cytokines. In addition, pro-angiogenesis genes were inhibited most strongly in the early stages of tumor progression by both compounds.

DYING YOUNG: MORTALITY FROM PANDEMIC INFLUENZA AND PNEUMONIA BY AGE GROUP
Andrew George Sherlock
Hunter College High School, New York City, NY

For nearly a century, scientists have struggled to explain why influenza causes death, why some outbreaks are more virulent than others, and why during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, young adults had higher mortality rates than the highest risk groups (the very young and the very old). Although significantly less virulent, the 2009 H1N1 outbreak resembles the 1918 pattern of morbidity and mortality rates by age group. This project tests the hypothesis that bacterial pneumonia (particularly S. pneumoniae and S. aureus coinfections) has a positive impact on influenza-associated death rates by age group. Mortality baseline figures from three periods during the twentieth century (1916-21, 1955-59, 1966-70) were analyzed graphically comparing age group and mortality per unit population. These data sets were analyzed statistically using three sets of independent sample T-tests, taking into account entire periods, pandemic years, and nonpandemic years. The first two sets of tests resulted in a medium-strength correlation for the data points in the 0-19 age group, while the third produced no relationship. Although all three tests indicated the presence of a strong correlation in the 20-64 age group, the most powerful relationship was similarly found in the pandemic years. None of the tests produced a positive correlation for the above 65 age group. This study suggests a fundamental connection exists between influenza and bacterial pneumonia, and adds to the growing number of reports that underscore the unexpected prevalence of secondary bacterial pneumonia combined with influenza in the low-risk group of individuals between 18 and 65 year olds.

BV-2 CELL RESPONSE TO DETRIMENTAL STIMULI
Madeline Grace Rollins
Walter Payton College Prepatory High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose<br><br>The objective of the experiment was to observe the immune response of the immortalized BV-2 microglia cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the absence and presence of small compounds at different concentrations. These compounds are synthesized to see if the detrimental responses of over-reactive glial cells, such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can be selectively suppressed, which has the potential to slow the onset of disease in the central nervous system (CNS).<br><br>Procedure<br><br>The BV-2 cells will be cultured, treated with the inflammatory stimulant LPS for 20 hours, and then conditioned media and cells will be harvested. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide will be measured by ELISA and the Griess Assay, respectively.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>The experiments supported the hypothesis, in that the detrimental inflammatory responses of BV-2 cells, the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were suppressed in the presence of compounds 1 and 2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the effects of the compounds were selective, in that there was no inhibition of LPS-stimulated NO production up to the highest concentration of compound tested (30 micro molar). The results are important because they demonstrate that it is possible to develop small molecule experimental therapeutics that show selectivity in their action on microglia.

MYOCARDIAL INFLAMMATION IN YOUNG ADULTS EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION
Rodolfo Villarreal-Calderon
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Background: Air pollution increases risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Mexico City (MC) maintains high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and PM-associated lipopolysaccharides (PM-LPS) year-round. Objectives: Test whether young adults’ residency in different MC areas affects the degree of myocardial inflammation and endotoxin-associated markers. Methods: Left and right ventricle (LV and RV) autopsy samples from 21 MC residents, ages 18.45±2.6, from two distinct MC areas: 1) Southwest MC (SWMC), having high concentrations of PM-LPS; 2) North MC (NMC) with higher concentrations of PM2.5 (n=6 and n=15, respectively). Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from key inflammatory mediator genes interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the LPS receptor, cluster of differentiation antigen 14 (CD14), were quantified through real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: RVs showed significant SWMC versus NMC upregulation of IL-1β (p=0.008), TNF-α (p=0.001), IL-10(p=0.001) and CD14 (p=0.002). LVs’ TNF-α (p=0.007) and IL-10 (p=0.002) had significant differences, yet IL-1β and CD14 did not. Conclusions: Young adult chronic exposures to distinct urban air pollution environments produce significant differences in the upregulation of myocardial inflammatory genes and CD14 expression. CD14 and IL-1β upregulation suggests endotoxins play a key role in myocardial inflammation for highly exposed SWMC residents. Myocardial inflammation and occult cardiotoxicity may be a deleterious effect in exposed populations.

ARE EOSINOPHILS, IN HUMAN LUNG CANCER, AN INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC INDICATOR?
Akreeti Maskey
Hamilton High School East, Hamilton, NJ

In the United States, adenocarcinoma of lung is one of the leading causes of death in men and women. Factors which are relevant to the diagnosis, treatment, and clinical course include histologic differentiation, proliferative index, and lymph node and distant metastasis. The white blood cells, eosinophils, are attracted to lung cancer through chemokine eotaxin. It is possible that the lung cancer uses this immune response as a way to hide itself.<br><br> Twenty cases of adenocarcinoma in lung were selected from the database files. Ten cases were observed under a microscope at 40X magnification and pathology reports were reviewed. During observation, the number of eosinophils and plasma cells inside and outside of lung cancer were recorded. These cases were evaluated for primary versus secondary site of origin, extent of inflammatory component, and presence or absence of eosinophils within or adjacent to the tumor.<br><br> An increased relative proportion of mature eosinophils and plasma cells have been identified in a subset of tumors, adenocarcinomas. However, these white blood cells occurred more often in primary adenocarcinoma than metastatic to the lung. The level of differentiation seemed to have a great impact on the numbers of eosinophils and plasma cells.<br><br> The presence of these cells does not appear to harm the tumor in any way. Therefore, it is proposed that the tumor may be masking its presence by using the host’s immune response. If so, the presence or absence of an inflammatory component, and the composition of inflammation, may also have prognostic value.

LINKING FOOD AND MOOD: INSULIN REGULATION OF THE NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER
Vidiya Sathananthan
Martin Luther King
Magnet High School, Nashville, TN

Norepinephrine (NE) signaling in the central nervous system plays a vital role in signaling pathways involving stress, attention, mood, memory, and anxiety in addition to providing critical support for autonomic function. The principal mechanism by which norepinephrine synaptic transmission is terminated is the norepinephrine transporter (NET) (Iversen et al., 1971; Trendelenburg et. al., 1991). Because re-uptake of NE controls both the intensity and duration of NE signaling at the synapse, disturbance of NET function has the ability to affect both autonomic function and mental health. Earlier studies have shown that NET function and activity is altered by insulin, thus suggesting a link between metabolism and mood. In fact, functional deficiencies in the activity norepinephrine have been shown to be evident in animal models of diabetes and may predispose patients to the development of depression. We seek to determine the role of insulin signaling in modulating NET function, particularly in whether insulin and specific components of the insulin signaling pathway are capable of regulating NET surface availability. Here, we show that acute insulin treatment reduces NET surface expression human NET (hNET). Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K and Akt alone resulted in enhanced levels of NET, suggesting these components without insulin influence noradrenergic homeostasis. In addition, in the presence of insulin, inhibition of PI3K and overexpression of Akt-kinase dead both resulted in the blocking of insulin-induced downregulation of NET. These data suggest that insulin-related disorders, such as diabetes or obesity, may be linked to mood disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, by a specific mechanism: insulin modification of NET surface expression.

BABY'S BREATH: CAN I CHANGE THE EFFICIENCY OF A BABY'S RESPIRATORY RATE?
Destin Stratton
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

My experiment is to see if I can change the efficiency of oxygen intake in an infant by designing a more ergonomic mattress. I do this by laying the infant in a bed that has an elevated angle. I observe the oxygen saturation, the respiratory rate, and the heart rate of the infant while it is in a basic laid back position and then compare the same information in the enhanced position.<br><br>Before beginning, I have the parent complete a questionnaire to help rule out variables. The steps I followed in the experiment are as follows: While the baby is laying flat on its back, I count the number of chest rise and fall for one minute. Using a stethoscope I counted the babies pulse rate for one minute and then using a pulse oximeter I recorded oxygen saturation. Then I recorded the respiratory rate, pulse rate and oxygen saturation on the data sheet. I then changed the baby’s position by placing the infant on the enhanced mattress. I waited ten minutes. Then I repeated taking the measurements as above and recorded them.<br><br>I would like to use this research to help prevent SIDS. If there is a better position to put babies in to increase the amount of oxygen they receive, then this might help prevent the disease. Maybe a mattress could be produced that would keep the baby’s head elevated at an angle while they sleep.

FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WILMS TUMOR (WTI) PROMOTER REGION IN CANCER CELLS
Sarina Amanda Raman
Mount Hebron High School, Ellicott City, MD

Tumor suppressors are genes that protect normal cells from being transformed to a cancer cells. However, mutations or reduction in its functions can promote cells to progress to cancer. With respect to gene organization, there is a segment in front of this gene that controls its expression; this is called the promoter region. Many researchers are studying which part of the promoter region when inactive in normal cells promotes tumor formation. In this study, we are deciphering the activity of a gene called WT1 that is normally expressed, at basal levels, in kidney cells. This gene has been referred to as a tumor suppressor gene and is silenced in Wilms Tumor, a type of kidney cancer. The main purpose for this experiment is to study which region of the promoter is inactive in transformed cells resulting in the abrogation of WT1 gene expression. For experimental purposes, a putative WT1 promoter region was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The reasoning behind replacing the WT1 gene with the reporter gene is primarily due to the ease of measuring the reporter gene activity. Following the luciferase gene expression in cancer cells, its corresponding activity can be measured by a light-measuring instrument. Luciferase is an enzyme produced in fireflies that generates the glow or the light. The identical reaction is carried out in a test tube and the amount of light generated is measured and can be correlated to the activity of the gene; in this case WT1.

TARGETING THE MAPK SIGNALING CASCADE AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRASTUZUMAB RESISTANCE IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCERS
Emily Rose Summerbell
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

The tyrosine kinase receptor Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in approximately 25% of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and is associated with decreased survival rates and aggressive tumors. The HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is the only FDA-approved treatment for HER2-overexpressing MBCs; however, most MBC patients develop resistance within 9 months. It was hypothesized that downstream signaling from the MAPK cascade contributes to HER2 resistance, and inhibition of the MAPK cascade with MEK inhibitor PD0325901 would increase trastuzumab sensitivity. Tumor cell lines used in experimentation include: BT474 parental (trastuzumab-sensitive) and Clones 2 and 3(trastuzumab-resistant clones); SKBR3 parental (trastuzumab-sensitive) and Pool 2 (trastuzumab-resistant); MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 (trastuzumab-resistant). Western Blots (Immunoblots) and MTS Cellular Proliferation Assays were used to analyze drug efficacy in relation to protein expression and cellular proliferation. Immunoblots and MTS Proliferation Assays showed that PD0325901 inhibited MAPK signaling effectively but increased cellular proliferation in vitro in monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab, making MAPK inhibition an ineffective treatment. Interference from other pathways, potentially including negative feedback loops, is suspected and should be identified. Alternatively, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in combination with trastuzumab effectively decreased proliferation, proving that PI3K/Akt inhibitor-trastuzumab combination therapies are viable treatment options for increasing trastuzumab sensitivity and ultimately increasing survival in MBC patients.

MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE FOR QUANTITATIVE SINGLE-CELL PROFILING OF HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS, YEAR TWO
Jane Yoonhae Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold great potential for treating many fatal diseases. However, many clinical applications are hindered by limited understanding of hPSC behavior and biology. Some challenges include xenogenic contamination caused by animal products that maintain stem cell growth, making transplantations unsafe. Conventional culture systems also do not accurately reflect the 3D in vivo microenvironment. Furthermore, the enormous variation of hPSC lines indicates the need to compare differences between hPSC lines to find the best target cell population for transplantation therapies. To address these issues, a PDMS microfluidic device that reflects a 3D in vivo microenvironment was developed to sustain the growth and development of hPSCs and to profile their characteristics. In Year 1, feeder-free Matrigel of 20 µg mL-1 resulted in optimum growth confirming the robustness of the microfluidic culture device. Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell lines (H1, HSF6, IPSA1, IPSB2), were cultured under various chemically defined/feeder-free culture media to reduce xenogenic contamination. In Year 2, different stem cell lines were characterized through systematic analysis of multi-parallel detected marker expression in single cells. Pluripotent (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-80) and differentiation (SSEA1) marker expression were quantified. By profiling phenotypic responses of stem cells among different hPSCs, ideal stem cell lines for specific therapeutic purposes will be found. This microfluidic device represents an effective tool for maintaining optimum growth in a 3D microenvironment. The precision, high controllability and small reagent consumption of this microfluidic device can provide great opportunities for regenerative medicine.

CELL DEATH: A PROBLEM OR A SOLUTION?
Shivam Anami Patel
White Station High School, Memphis, TN

The research involves the cellular process apoptosis. The research performed was a continuation of last year’s work. The purpose of this year’s study was to demonstrate the effect of two different doses (20 and 40 µm) of a chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin (CPT), on apoptosis in colon cancer cells (Caco2) and normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6). The drug induces DNA fragmentation in cells. The hypothesis for this study is that if cell growth increases or cell death decreases than cancer could result. If this is true then cancer cells will either grow rapidly or die slowly or not die at all. I predict that the normal cell line, IEC-6, will be much more sensitive to camptothecin than the cancerous cell line, Caco2. The study involved the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the BCA protein assay. The results were analyzed using the ANOVA test and Tukey-Kramer test. After the cell lines were prepared and treated with CPT the cells were observed under a microscope. The micrograph showed that some of the treated and untreated IEC-6 cells had died and floated to the top of the wells, which did not happen in the Caco2 cells. The ANOVA test showed that the 20 µm CPT increased DNA fragmentation by approximately six fold in the IEC-6 cell line. However, very little change was measured in the treated and untreated Caco2 cells. In conclusion, the campthothecin treatment was affective in the IEC-6, but not in Caco2 cells. The Caco2 cells were highly resistant to CPT.

RATIONAL DRUG DESIGN METHODS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR OF A4B2 NICOTINIC RECEPTORS
Ameya Ashish Deshmukh
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH

In 2006, 75 million Americans reported to have used some form of tobacco. This is equated to $150 billion in healthcare costs due to addiction to nicotine, a chemical found in tobacco. Nicotine interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the Central Nervous System to facilitate the addiction process. Current treatment options for treating nicotinic addiction have their own flaws and shortcomings. The purpose of this study was to use rational drug design to identify a "negative allosteric modulator," which shows both potency and selectivity for binding to the allosteric site on the receptor. Initially, a computer model of a pharmacophore was constructed from five drug molecules with known activity, which was then utilized for virtual screening against a database containing 10,000 molecules. This yielded 150 hits of which 11 were chosen for in vitro testing with transfected human embryonic kidney cells using fluorescence measurements. The top three molecules were then chosen to construct dose-response curves, from which IC-50 values were determined and compared. A contour map was then constructed using compound 9034247 (which showed the highest potency and selectivity) to identify important structural features of the "binding domain." It was concluded that it was possible to predict structural features necessary for binding from the pharmacophore modeling and in vitro testing, which led to the identification of one lead molecule. Finally, the contour mapping provided knowledge of the structural features of the "binding domain" such that a more potent and selective molecule can be designed through an iterative process.

WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL RATIO OF GLUCOSE TO FRUCTOSE THAT PREVENTS FRUCTOSE MALABSORPTION?
Logan Louis Davis-Wallace
Clovis High School, Clovis, CA

Chronic abdominal pain occurs in 30% of children, ages 4-18 years old (ref. 1). Symptoms of fructose malabsorption include abdominal pain. Fructose is used as a common sweetener in foods and beverages. Initial studies for this project showed that 70% of the subjects tested malabsorbed 50g of fructose, as measured by breath hydrogen analysis with gas chromatography (BHAGC). A subsequent study using 7up®, which contains 50g of fructose and 40 g glucose, showed that none of the subjects who previously malabsorbed fructose demonstrated fructose malabsorption or complained of abdominal pain. Last year’s study confirmed it was glucose in the soda that prevented fructose malabsorption, since none of the subjects showed malabsorption using 50 g of fructose and 40 g of glucose in a water solution. <br><br> This project studied three different ratios of fructose to glucose to determine the optimal ratio necessary to eliminate the malabsorption of fructose using BHAGC. Results showed that a 55% fructose to 45% glucose mixture eliminated malabsorption of fructose and its related symptoms in all subjects. Adding smaller amounts of glucose improved the absorption of 50 g of fructose, but did not eliminate malabsorption or symptoms of abdominal pain in all subjects. This conclusion was confirmed by testing additional symptomatic patients that had previously malabsorbed fructose and had symptoms of abdominal pain. This study suggests that adding glucose to high fructose foods could have therapeutic benefits in people with chronic abdominal pain, as fructose malabsorption may be an important factor in people with abdominal pain.

ROLE OF TSPYL1, FGIF, AND MTF-1 IN GAMMA-GLOBIN GENE ACTIVATION FOR TREATMENT OF HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES: A TISSUE STUDY IN NOVEL BINARY TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODELS
Prarthana Jignesh Dalal
Shawnee Mission East High School, Prairie Village, KS

Hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) are common genetic diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. Hemoglobinopathies affect hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells. These abnormal hemoglobin molecules distort red blood cells into sickle cells causing vascular complications leading to high morbidity and mortality. Symptoms can be treated by reactivating human fetal hemoglobin which contains gamma-globin subunits. Unraveling the mechanisms controlling gamma-globin gene expression is important for discerning new targets for therapeutic intervention. The human proteins testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like (TSPYL1), fetal globin inducing factor (FGIF), and metal transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) represent potential targets. In this tissue study, novel binary transgenic mouse models containing a human beta-yeast artificial chromosome and an erythroid-specific cDNA expression construct containing the transactivator were constructed and globin expression was analyzed in relation to the enforced gene. Results show that MTF-1 and TSPYL1 are transactivators of gamma-globin and this identification opens new avenues for novel treatments of hemoglobinopathies.

THE CORONARY CALCIUM SCAN: INVESTIGATING THE EARLY PREDICTION AND AWARENESS OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE IN WOMEN
Preeti Anita Prakash
Curtis Senior High School, University Place, WA

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the #1 killer of women in America. The study investigated the incremental value of incorporating the level of Coronary Calcium, determined by the Coronary Calcium Scan, in the risk assessment of coronary heart disease in women. The traditional Framingham coronary heart disease risk (FRS) factors- Chronological Age, Total Cholesterol, HDL, Systolic Blood Pressure, Smoking Status, and the Use of Blood Pressure Medications- as well as the Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Scores for anonymous female patients ages 50-70 were collected. Then, the 10-year Arterial Age risk percentage, incorporating the FRS factors and the CAC score, and the Chronological Age risk percentage, incorporating only the FRS factors, were calculated for the patients. Although a CAC score cut-off of 300 is generally considered incrementally valuable, the ANOVA model performed in this study showed that for CAC scores greater than or equal to 100, the distribution of the 10-year Arterial Age Risk had significantly increased risk percentages compared to the distribution of the 10-year Chronological Age risk. This study raises the question of whether women with FRS of as little as 4 or greater should be referred to a Coronary Calcium Scan for an accurate predictive assessment. Given the apparent importance of the CAC score for determining one’s risk for CHD, a survey of the general female population was conducted to assess the awareness of CHD risk factors and coronary calcium. The awareness of all CHD risk factors and CAC proved limited. Implementing the coronary calcium scan as an effective early predictor of CHD for more women and using more invasive methods to increase CHD awareness may be the key in curbing this deadly disease.

PIECE DE RESISTANCE: THE SYNTHESIS OF COMPLEX DIMERIC PYRROLE-IMIDAZOLE ALKALOID NATURAL PRODUCT DERIVATIVES AND THEIR EFFICACY IN INHIBITING AND DISPERSING PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS
Justin To
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Objective: Bacterial biofilms, protected communities of bacteria, are response in nearly 80% of all infections. They are implicated in cystic fibrosis,urinary tract infections, dental plaque, secondary hospital infections, and infection of medical parts like catheters. In a non-medical perspective, biofilms hinder crop development and play a major role in increasing fuel costs for naval transportation. Hence, a need for a compound to both disperse and inhibit biofilms arises.Ultimately, this project seeks to identify small molecules effective at dispersing and/or inhibiting biofilms. <br><br>Method: Recently, ageliferin, a compound extracted from Agelas Coniferas sponges, was discovered to have biofilm inhibiting properties. Hence, synthetic ageliferin was synthesized to investigate these properties. Smaller derivatives based on ageliferin were also investigated.After synthesis, the compounds were analyzed via proton and carbon-13 NMR spectometry and GC/MS. The compounds were also purified via HPFC. The compounds were then tested in flow chambers on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa strain 14 (PA14) biofilms in a BSL-2 environment and analyzed under confocal microscopy to determine biomass changes.<br><br>Results: The compounds were synthesized correctly based on NMR spectra. The compounds, particularly the dibrominated and methylated variant, have the potential to significantly inhibit and moderately disperse PA14 biofilms. The aforementioned variant showed the most <br><br>promise, with over 95% inhibition and 80% dispersion.<br><br>Conclusion: To date, this was the first attempted synthesis of these molecules in a non-university setting. The presence of a 2-AI group is needed for biological action, and research suggests that these compounds act via a Zn(II) modulating mechanism.

BAYESIAN MODELING OF MALARIA DYNAMICS IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON: POTENTIAL APPLICATION TO MALARIA ERADICATION AND VALIDATION BY PENGUIN MALARIA FIELD STUDY
Kai Maroon Kuspa
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

Malaria affects an estimated 300-500 million people across the globe every year, causing another 1,000,000 deaths. Mathematical models of malaria transmission incorporating distilled complex parameters can incorporate empiric data and undergo biological validation towards guiding strategies of malaria control. This project aims to describe how the vast geographic region of the Amazonian Basin containing large human and mosquito populations could be purged of malaria. With tremendously diverse ecotopes ranging from the high jungle of the Andes to the tropical rainforest, malaria elimination from the Amazon represents an enormous challenge. Data over the course of nine years (2000-2009) was collected in provinces of the Amazon recording the number of cases identified in hospitals and clinics. An original mathematical model of transmission created to distill essential parameters of malaria dynamics was designed, which, using empiric data, allowed for Bayesian modeling; calculus and statistical methods were used to describe the current state of malaria transmission in Peru. This model was used to predict the outcome of an introduction of a novel approach to malaria control to human populations: a transmission blocking vaccine that would prevent humans (the only reservoir) from infecting vector mosquitoes. A field study of penguin malaria is also presented describing a potential biological model of direct relevance to human malaria transmission. This research has direct application to the current audacious goal of global malaria eradication, which would improve millions of lives around the world, improve economies of affected regions, and could even be used in the military to protect our troops deployed in malaria-endemic regions.

DETECTION OF UV PROTECTION: ASSESSING SPFS IN A BACTERIAL MODEL
Wardah Nasir
Westmount Secondary, Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA

Protection from short-wave ultraviolet light (UV) radiation is critical in the resistance of humans from its harmful effects such as sunburn and cancer. I developed a novel model system, using the bacteria Kocuria rhizophilia, which are frequently present on human skin, to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreen protection factors (SPF) in sunscreens to protect against the lethal effects of short-wave UV light. The ability of SPFs to protect against UV light was assessed by determining the percentage of bacteria to survive following direct exposure to UV light at 254 nm in the presence of sunscreen cassettes, which I constructed and loaded with sunscreen containing various SPFs. These cassettes were designed to keep the amount of sunscreen applied controlled, and allow minimal amount of UV radiation to be absorbed by other materials not included in the contents of the sunscreen. The results demonstrated a dose dependent protective effect of SPF against the lethal effects of short-wave UV light as sunscreens with higher SPFs allowed more bacteria to survive compared to bacteria lacking UV light protection. Sunscreens with higher SPFs also demonstrated better protection of bacteria against longer UV light exposure. This model system has the potential to be adapted for studying the protective effect of other materials against short-wave UV light such as glass, plastics, and fabrics. The model system might serve to better explain protection against the harmful effects of UV light on human skin.

OOLONG TEA EXTRACT INHIBITS THE GROWTH AND PROLIFERATION OF HUMAN CANCER CELLS
On-Ki Lee

The daily consumption of tea in the world is exorbitantly high, second to water only. In addition to its distinctive aroma and taste, tea, which contains many antioxidants, is renounced for its beneficial effects to our health. One of the cancer curing theories points out that antioxidants are good for cancer patients. Thus, it is believed that drinking tea could prevent a certain kinds of cancers.<br><br>I designed an experiment using Oolong, Green Tea, Jasmine and Pu Erh to compare their antioxidizing power. It indicated that Oolong may be the best antioxidizing agent for cancer research. To test my hypothesis, human prostate cancer cells DU145 and liver cancer cells HepG2 were employed. Oolong tea leaves were brewed into extracts, and then lyophilized as OTE. Both cancer cells were treated with different amount of OTE in vitro. MTT assay showed that certain concentration of OTE significantly lowers cell viability (IC50 = 0.229 mg/ml in HepG2 and 0.094 mg/ml in DU145). In order to find out how OTE affecting the cells, flow cytometry was carried out. Results illustrated that cancer cell cycle was obstructed, and underwent apoptosis, with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. It is an encouraging discovery that OTE has inhibitory effect on the growth and proliferation of these two human cancer cells. It strikes a definite impact on suppressing the spreading of cancer cells. If it is successful, cancer patients not only can enjoy a good cup of tea but they can also receive a low cost and convenient treatment.

MOLECULAR MODELING OF VIRAL PROTEASE INHIBITORS: FOCUS ON DENGUE FEVER
Andrew Warren Navia
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

Published X-ray structures of the NS3 protease of Hepatitis C, an important flavivirus disease in the developed world, were used to design inhibitors of the NS3 protease of a related flavivirus that causes Dengue. With no vaccines or drugs available, Dengue epidemics periodically sweep through the developing world. <br><br>The original hypothesis was to superimpose the structures of the Hepatitis C and Dengue NS3 proteases, to see if the NS3 inhibitor boceprevir (currently in clinical trials against Hepatitis C) could be modified to work against Dengue. An active NS3 protease is necessary for infectivity in all the flaviviruses. As the project developed, it was found that NS3 proteases adopt a “closed” or “open” conformation depending on whether an inhibitor is bound to them or not. A change in plans was necessary, since no structure of inhibited Dengue NS3 was available. A computer model of Dengue NS3 had to be built to support the inhibitor design goals.<br><br>Boceprevir and other flavivirus NS3 inhibitors were fit into the binding site of my “closed” Dengue NS3 protease model. Hybrid designs were generated from the inhibitors structures, which were then simplified to produce a number of compounds for chemical synthesis. <br><br>Dengue NS3 inhibitors that could serve as starting points for drug development were designed using data and programs freely available on the Internet. The pharmaceutical industry in developing countries should be able to create new drugs for Dengue and other priority diseases for their people, without help from the developed world.

KILLING CANCER'S CAUSE: A MODEL TO TARGET CANCER STEM CELLS
Meghan Lynn McHugh
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro, MA

Cancer stem cells have been shown to cause cancer, initiating its growth. Cancer stem cells are not targeted by current cancer therapies and are left in the body after treatment, causing a recurrence and spread of the cancer. Planarians can regenerate due to their neoblasts, the planarian equivalent of stem cells, which resemble cancer stem cells. Kava, cocoa, copaiba and grape seed extracts have anti-cancer properties or inhibit stem cells’ ability to regenerate structures. It was hypothesized that the extracts would inhibit planarian regeneration, showing that the neoblasts have died and the extracts could potentially target cancer stem cells to create a more effective cancer treatment. <br><br> Planarians were divided into five groups: kava, cocoa, copaiba and grape seed extract, and the control group. The experimental groups were placed in 1% concentration of their assigned extract for 24 hours. The control planarians were placed in water. The planarians were then dissected and allowed 7 days to regenerate. The percent of regeneration was then calculated. <br><br> All planarians in copaiba and grape seed groups died. The surviving planarians regenerated 43.6% for kava, 52.7% for cocoa, and 70.1% for the control group. Cocoa regenerated 75.2% as much as the control group and kava regenerated 62.2% as much. <br><br> The copaiba and grape seed groups died from the high concentrations of extracts. The kava and cocoa were effective at inhibiting regeneration and killing neoblasts. The applications of this project are immense. Cancer is a very deadly disease, with cancer stem cells being the source behind the disease, its recurrence and spread. Being able to target cancer stem cells in cancer treatments would be invaluable to the cure of cancer.

FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGENERATION OF DUGESIA TIGRINA
Marie Danielle Goering
Lakeview High School, Columbus, NE

To study the effects of various chemical factors that could either enhance or inhibit tissue growth during regeneration of brown planaria (Dugesia tigrina), a series of experiments were done. Testing the rate of regeneration for planaria may provide basic information about regeneration in soft human tissues. Thus, manipulated variables were chosen from materials found in humans’ everyday lives, i.e. aspirin, protein, multivitamins, and calcium carbonate. Environmental testing included variations in temperature, pH, and lighting. <br><br>Planaria were placed in individual petri dishes and photographed under a dissecting microscope. They were bisected into anterior and posterior halves. Halves were placed into labeled Petri dishes containing various solution additives ranging in .100% to 0.000% concentrations. Recovery rate was measured by the number of days for the planaria to complete regeneration.<br><br>The average rate of regeneration for the control groups was thirteen days. Aspirin slowed the rate of regeneration in planaria, and was found to be lethal in high dosages. Calcium carbonate significantly increased the rate of regeneration (a 23% reduction in time), possibly because it was part of the nutritional diet of the planaria. The multivitamin solution appeared to increase the rate of regeneration within the first seven days; however, there was a high mortality rate after thirteen days. Soy protein solutions caused a high mortality rate, possibly due to other additives in the commercially available protein product used. Dark, room temperature environments appeared to be the best environment for the regenerative process, possibly because it emulates the planaria’s natural conditions.

UNVEILING THE MOLECULAR MACHINERY THAT DRIVES CA2+–TRIGGERED PLATELET GRANULE SECRETION
Yue Zhao
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Central to platelet activation is the Ca2+-triggered release of cargo from three secretory vesicle stores; dense core granules, alpha-granules, and lysosomes. SNARE proteins residing in secretory vesicle membranes (v-SNAREs) and in the target/plasma membrane (t-SNAREs) assemble into complexes that directly catalyze bilayer fusion and mediate secretion. However, the molecular mechanism by which Ca2+ is coupled to SNARE-mediated granule secretion remains unknown. Here, we show that Munc13-4, a cytosolic protein with two Ca2+-binding C2 domains, is required for Ca2+-triggered platelet granule secretion. Using an in vitro reconstituted membrane fusion system we demonstrate that Munc13-4 stimulates SNARE–mediated membrane fusion in response to Ca2+, whereas Ca2+-binding mutants of Munc13-4 fail to stimulate fusion in response to Ca2+. Analysis of Munc13-4 effector interactions revealed that Munc13-4 does not directly bind t- or v-SNAREs in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but does cluster/aggregate liposomes containing the anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, in response to Ca2+. These results suggest that Munc13-4 acts as a “molecular tether” that bridges apposing membranes through Ca2+-dependent phospholipid interactions and thereby stimulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Our data shed light on the underlying molecular machinery that drives Ca2+-triggered platelet vesicle secretion and reveal mechanisms by which platelet function can be controlled.

THE STUDY OF SS-LACTAM PENICILLINS IN THE PRESENCE OF SS-LACTAMASE INHIBITORS IN PENICILLIN RESISTANT ESCHERICHIA COLI CONTAINING CLASS A SS-LACTAMASES
Rebecca Lynn Gregory
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

The purpose of this experiment was to study penicillin resistance. Over time penicillin has become virtually useless against various pathogens, as is the case with E. coli. E. coli has developed an enzyme, ß-lactamase, that has the ability to break the ß-lactam ring of penicillins, thus allowing the E. coli to have resistance to the penicillin. In this experiment, three different inhibitors were tested, (sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid) in combination with four ß-lactam penicillin antibiotics (Benzylpenicillin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, and Carbencillin). The number of colonies in each treatment group was counted after an incubation period of twenty hours to calculate the percentage dead relative to the control group (no inhibitor and no antibiotic), and to determine the rate at which the penicillin and inhibitor combinations destroyed the E. coli, percent transmittance over time was measured via a spectrophotometer. Each treatment was replicated three times, and the starting concentration of each trial in each experimental started at a value of 70% transmittance (approximately 350 CFUs), as measured on a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nanometers. My study showed that penicillin alone killed an average of only 27.3% of bacteria, with inhibitor and penicillin combinations killing an average of 89.9% of bacteria. Overall, penicillin in combination with an inhibitor decreases the amount of E. coli more effectively than penicillin and inhibitors by themselves, and from this experiment, I can conclude that four combinations were positive (Ampicillin and clavulanic acid, Benzylpenicillin and sulbactam, Ampicillin and tazobactam, and Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid).

IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL SIGNAL PATHWAY AND ITS THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR TOBACCO PROMOTION OF LUNG CANCER
Angela Zhang
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent smoking related malignancies, causing ~1.2 million to die annually. Despite tremendous advancements in our knowledge about lung cancer, the molecular mechanism of tobacco promotion of lung cancer and metastasis remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to uncover the molecular mechanism of nicotine promotion of lung cancer cell progression and metastasis and its cancer therapeutic potential. In this study, lung cancer cells H345 were treated with nicotine and subjected to transwell cell invasion assay. It was found that Nicotine stimulated a significant increase in lung cancer cell migration. Applying western blotting, probed with anti-phosphothreonine antibody, and immunocytochemistry revealed that Nicotine induced the inactivation of Moesin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein, through the dephosphorylation of the protein. Transfecting silenced Moesin with siRNA in H345 cells, caused a spontaneous lung cancer cell invasion, which was not able to be further potentiated by nicotine. This indicates that Moesin is the primary tumor suppressor that negatively regulates nicotine’s effects. Rho kinase (ROCK) and thioredoxin were further identified to be downstream components of Moesin in the nicotine pathway. Inhibition of ROCK by Y27632 or silencing of thioredoxin by siRNA aborogated nicotine-induced cell migration. This is the first study demonstrating that these components, specifically Moesin, participate in the nicotine signaling cascade. These results strongly suggest that Moesin negatively regulates nicotine’s promotion of lung cancer cells metastasis. Therapeutic modulations of Moesin and its signaling pathway will provide innovative approaches to the treatment of lung cancer metastasis and tobacco related cancers.

A MONOMER-ENRICHED GRAPE-SEED POLYPHENOLIC EXTRACT ATTENUATES THE PROGRESSION OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL DYSFUNCTIONS IN THE TG2576 TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Phoebe Elizabeth Kurtzman
Suffern High School, Suffern, NY

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the United States and much of the world. Those with AD display a wide range of cognitive deficiencies. A variety of polyphenol-rich dietary components have been suggested as effective in slowing the progression of AD. More recently, AD research has focused on the efficacy of grapes and in particular, a grape-seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE), namely the MegaNatural GSPE, in treating the disease. The GSPE is comprised of multiple poyphenolic compounds that are in monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric forms. Despite evidence supporting the development of the MegaNatural GSPE for treating AD, there is no information on the identity of the bioactive GSPE component(s). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a monomer-enriched GSPE isolate on the overall cognitive behavior of the Tg2576 AD mouse model, determined by utilizing the object recognition test to assess the cognitive functionality of the mice. This study suggests that the monomeric components of the GSPE are responsible for the efficacy of the GSPE to interfere with AD-type cognitive-deficits, and supports the feasibility of developing monomeric GSPE components for treating AD patients with existing cognitive dysfunction.

ANDROGEN THERAPY: A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR PROSTATE CANCER
Kushal Ulhas Naik
The Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, DE

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It usually does not manifest symptoms before it metastasizes, but it can then quickly become fatal. Hormonal therapy for prostate cancer usually involves anti-androgen treatment, because early-stage prostate cancer cells rely on androgens for their survival. However, an advanced prostate cancer becomes insensitive to androgen and no longer requires it for survival. I investigated the role of JAM-A, a metastatic inhibitor, on prostate cancer cells. I used a line of highly metastatic androgen-independent PC-3 cells. Using a Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, the expression of JAM-A in several prostate cancer cell lines was evaluated. I found that PC-3 cells expressed much less JAM-A than others. An examination of tissue microarrays revealed that as the cancer progresses, JAM-A level decreased. When PC-3 cells were treated with androgen for two days, JAM-A levels increased, along with a dramatic change in the morphology, which correlated androgen insensitivity to JAM-A expression. An invasion assay confirmed that a steep loss of JAM-A expression occurred. Thus, cancer cells need to shed their JAM-A in order to metastasize. The free JAM-A in the bloodstream can be measured and used as a diagnostic indicator for cancer, and an existing cancer can be biopsied and tested for JAM-A in order to determine whether it is invasive or noninvasive. Even though anti-androgen therapy can be useful to halt early-onset prostate cancer, once the cancer stops requiring them for survival, treatment with androgens can stop it from spreading and save many lives.

EFFECT OF ANTI-TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 7 RELATED ANTIBODY ON ANGIOGENESIS
Susmitha Ganti
Central High School, Philadelphia, PA

My topic is to study the effect of anti-TEM7R antibody on angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrate into cancerous growths, supplying nutrients & oxygen, and removing waste products. This experiment uses two types of endothelial cells-(HUVEC and F9) to examine whether or not, the anti-tumor endothelial marker 7 related proteins localize to the cancerous sites.<br><br> My purpose is that, the angiogenesis of the tumor growth will decrease when the anti-TEM7R antibody is used. I conducted a matri-gel tube formation assay to establish an in-vitro model. First, coat the wells with matri-gel, and incubate. Next trypsinize the cells, pipette the volume needed into centrifuge tubes, and spin down the cells. Finally, after pipetting 300µL of cells & 10µL of BB1 antibody into each well, incubate both cell types for at least 4 hours.<br><br> My results are shown in face contrast images and my statistical data was determined by the lengths of the matri-gel tubes. My data is represented by tables and graphs. It does not support my hypothesis that when the BB1 antibody is used, the HUVEC cells will show a substantial decrease in total lengths of the tube formations as well as cell rate. From my experiment it was found that F9 endothelial cells proved to be a better substitute in this experiment because they showed no matri-gel tubes when tested with the BB1 antibody.

THE EFFECTS OF LEUKOTOXIN ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
Ryan WesLee Lawrence
Starkville Christian School, Starkville, MS

Our magnificent immune system has been intelligently designed to fight off different diseases. However, there are some bacteria that evade our immune system by secreting harmful toxins to kill leukocytes. One of these is Mannheimia haemolytica, and it secretes leukotoxin, a harmful substance that kills neutrophils.<br><br> I hypothesized that leukotoxin is also lethal to monocytes. Monocytes are similar to neutrophils in that they are both phagocytes. Both therefore will destroy bacteria.<br><br> I tested my hypothesis by running experiments on bovine monocytes. We collected blood from cows and separated the cells to collect the monocytes. Once we had accomplished this, we added leukotoxin to the cells, and after an hour of incubation, viewed our results on a flow cytometer. Though our first test run didn’t show killing of monocytes, our second showed that leukotoxin does indeed kill monocytes. However, it takes a greater amount than it would for neutrophils.

PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS USING METABOLOMIC FINGERPRINTS
Rahul Ananth Doraiswami
Foothill High School, Pleasanton, CA

Prostate cancer, a deadly disease, is extremely difficult to detect. According to the National Cancer Institute, the current gold standard prostate specific antigen (PSA) test is only 25-35% accurate.<br><br>80% of prostate cancers are caused by androgen-driven oncogenes. When the gene that codes for the enzyme Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) fuses with V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) and is triggered by the Androgen Receptor, it creates the E twenty six family transcription factor (ETS). Additionally, the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, Homolog 2 (EZH2), a “gene silencer”, is prevalent in prostate cancer. The metabolite Sarcosine increases with both ETS gene fusion and over-expression of EZH2, making it a valuable bio-marker. Scientists believe there is an additional set of metabolite bio-markers. I wanted to develop a system to detect this multiplexed panel.<br><br> <br><br>Metabolites are outputs of metabolic pathways (cellular chemical transformations); I needed a method to capture these transformations. My research showed that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are excellent for pattern-detection. I designed, built, trained and tested multiple ANNs to detect the metabolite “fingerprints” of prostate cancer. Despite limited clinical data my networks were 87.5% -100% accurate. I also built a Genetic Algorithm, modeled after biological evolution, to narrow the metabolite panel to ten. I now have a diagnostic system that will “learn” from new clinical data and become even more accurate. The system is useful for clinical diagnosis, drug development and personalized medicine in prostate cancer.

SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF TURMERIC FORCE ON GEMCITABINE CYTOTOXICITY IN PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS BY MODULATION OF APOPTOSIS
Renuka Ramchandran
John A. Ferguson Senior High School, Miami, FL

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly form of human cancer with a high death rate and without curative treatment options. The average survival period of pancreatic cancer patients is less than 6 months after diagnosis. The most recent drug for pancreatic cancer, Gemcitabine, has not improved survival time for pancreatic cancer patients. India has one of the lowest incidences of pancreatic cancer compared to western countries. Coincidentally, an average Indian consumes about 1.8 g of turmeric per day. Last year, my project showed that Turmeric Force, a supercritical hydroethanolic turmeric extract sold as a supplement in the U.S., when combined with Gemcitabine, increased the drug's efficiency. Gemcitabine and Turmeric Force were strongly synergistic together, having combination index values of 0.231 and 0.631 at IC50 and IC75 levels, respectively. The main objective of this project was to analyze the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of Turmeric Force on Gemcitabine cytotoxicity. Both Gemcitabine and Turmeric Force induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the combination of Gemcitabine and Turmeric Force induced higher percentages of apoptosis and necrosis than either agent alone in BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells. The combination treatment upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, Bax and p53, and downregulated anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X, more than with a single agent treatment. These results show that synergistic cytotoxicity between Gemcitabine and Turmeric Force is due to increased regulation of apoptotic genes leading to increased induction of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Since the combination works by the genetically controlled cell death process, successful responses in patients are possible.

DOES THE DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPE PREDOMINATE OVER THAT OF HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY AND RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY?
Erin Maria Alexander
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

In vitro investigations into Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Restrictive Cardiomyopathy show that mutations in cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) produce a pathogenic state via increases in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas mutations in cTnT that cause Familial Dilated Cardiomyoptahy (DCM) decrease Ca2+ sensitivity and the maximal force. Our aim was to determine whether combinatory mutations of an HCM, RCM, and a DCM in cTnT yield an intermediate or dominant phenotype that could be correlated with the clinical condition seen in patients. Standard laboratory methods were used for cloning, expression, and purification of the WT and mutants:<br><br>DK210 (DCM), I79N (HCM), DE96 (RCM), DE96/I79N, DE96/DK210, and DK210/I79N. The Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and maximal force were evaluated. The extent of TnT displacement was analyzed by measuring the unregulated tension at pCa 8.0 after cTnT treatment and none of the mutants showed an inability to displace the native cTn complex. Both double mutants (DK210/I79N and DK210/DE96) containing the DCM mutant showed a rightward shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity with a decrease in maximal force. Circular dichroism measurements demonstrated that all three double mutants had lower alpha helical content than WT. in contrast, single mutant I79N (significantly) and DK210 (showed a tendency) to increase alpha helical content. From the skinned fiber data, DK210 has a dominant effect over I79N and DE96 mutations in cTnT. These results suggest that cTnT can exist in different conformations that may be responsible for these distinct functional phenotypes.

A MIRACULOUS COST-EFFECTIVE NATURAL DIETARY INTERVENTION THAT REVERSES AN EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, & ARTHRITIS IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA: THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIC SAFFLOWER OIL & FLAX SEED OIL WITH VITAMIN D & A MULTIVITAMIN
Ericka Maxine Wheeler
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the established nutritional benefits of omega-6 and omega 3 (EFA’s), when introduced into the diet of patients enrolled in a family health clinic in the Mississippi Delta. Will this dietary intervention reduce abdominal fat, type II diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis? A diet composed of highly saturated fatty acid has led to many diseases resulting in the state being #1 in all of these statistics according to health studies. Conversely, healthy EFA’s should result in a reversal of these diseases. The study consisted of adult patients with BMI’s greater than or equal to 30, diabetes, hypertension, or arthritis. No dietary interventions or exercise was recommended. A two to one ratio of safflower oil to flax seed oil was mixed in 18 ounce bottles. Vitamin D and multivitamins were given to all patients because of an established deficiency of these substances in the clinic. All subjects had their abdominal girth, blood pressure, weight, height, blood sugar level, applicable HGB A1C, lipid profiles, along with a regular physical exam prestudy and 90-day post study, measured and recorded. Compliance with the other medicines was ascertained monthly. Monthly measurements included abdominal girth, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, weight, and questions. The study revealed that the supplemental EFA’s statistically reduced abdominal fat, hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. The average abdominal girth loss was 1.5 inches, weight loss was 5 pounds, fasting blood sugars were lowered by an average of 16 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1C levels were lowered by an average of 0.6%, systolic blood pressure decreased by an average of 8mm, and diastolic blood pressure decreased by an average of 6mm. Documented was less pain medication use, and the average pain level lowered from 7 to 4 on a pain scale of 0 to 10. My hypothesis was correct. The addition of EFA’s to patients at risk should be promoted daily by healthcare providers. They are more cost-effective than any pharmaceuticals and will reverse the diseases that affected our population studied. The supplements cost $12.95 per month for the average person and will be a revolutionary, economical addition for all Americans. Long- term studies and further research is desperately needed.

GLUCOSAMINYL (N-ACETYL) TRANSFERASE 2 (GCNT2) GENE EXPRESSION HIGHLY INFLUENCES BREAST CANCER METASTASIS AND PROMOTES AN EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (EMT)
Sherwin Zhang Wu
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer affecting women today, and its metastasis has become the hallmark of breast cancer mortality. There is increasing evidence which identifies metastasis as a multifaceted process with many steps regulated by numerous genes. Recent studies have identified genes encoding for transcription factors which concurrently enhance cancer metastasis and promote an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular program normally occurring only during embryogenesis in which epithelial cells morph into a mesenchymal phenotype. This study focuses on the Glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) Transferase 2 (GCNT2) gene. It was isolated through gene expression array analysis and its expression was found to correlate with breast cancer cell metastatic ability. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GCNT2 in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and Immortalized Human Mammary Epithelial (HMLE) cells found it to be localized in the cell cytoplasm, but showed no difference in cell proliferation or colony formation. GCNT2 did, however, cause a profound increase in cell migration in vitro and promoted an EMT. Interestingly, GCNT2 selectively suppressed epithelial markers rather than affecting both epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Also, GCNT2 suppression in 4T1 breast cancer cells showed marked morphology changes and significantly down-regulated cell migration and invasion. These findings collectively suggest that GCNT2 is a novel gene that is probably involved in breast cancer metastasis, setting the ground for further studies of this gene which may lead to effective strategies and novel therapies against breast cancer metastasis.

TOWARDS BUILDING A RESPIRATORY MONITORING DEVICE: ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF A THERMISTOR-BASED SENSOR
Nicole Yeechi Tsai
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood. Although there is no cure insofar, it can be controlled with early detection. A comfortable, compact sensor is essential for children at school, who cannot be monitored at all times. The aim of this study was to design and construct a miniature device to take accurate measurements of respiration rate. This device utilized a thermistor that was placed in the nasal area. The device was assessed for accuracy by juxtaposing its data with that of a respiration belt. These two devices simultaneously recorded the respiration rates of 12 adolescent subjects. Based on the analysis of the collected data, the performance of the thermistor-sensor was comparable with that of a respiration belt. The Pearson correlation indicated a strong relationship between the breathing intervals produced by each device (r=0.9953). The paired t-test indicated that the relationship was significant as well (p<0.0001). When data was analyzed as a whole, the Bland–Altman analysis revealed a high degree of agreement. A percentage of 95.3 of the data points lay within the ± 2 standard deviation of the mean difference. In effect, this study showed that thermistor-based sensors are effective in monitoring respiration rate. This device can potentially help individuals manage their asthma.

On this research the Rubus florulentus (Mountain strawberry) and Momordica charantia L. (Cundeamor) mixed extracts were used as a natural remedy to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, and Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Penicillium sp, fungi. The concentration of the extracts were: 2:1, 1:2 and 2:2; (2 mL of the Momordica charantia L. extract and 1 mL of the Rubus florulentus extract, 1 mL of the Rubus florulentus extract and 2 mL of the Momordica charantia L. extract, and 2 mL of the Momordica charantia L. extract and 2 mL of the Rubus florulentus extract). The extracts used were both pasteurized and non-pasteurized samples.<br><br>The inhibition rings were moistened and put on Petri dishes with in vitro bacteria and fungi separately. A negative control (water) and a positive one (Clotrimazole and Ampicillin) were also used. On the Escherichia coli bacteria and the Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium sp. fungi the 2:1 non- pasteurized mixture was more effective than the other extracts mixtures. The 1:2 pasteurized mixtures evidenced a major inhibition on the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. On the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria the major inhibitor was the 2:1 pasteurized mixture. Finally, on the Rhizopus sp. fungi the 1:2 non-pasteurized mixture had the major inhibitory effect. The GC-MS characterization test of the plants’ extracts used to identify different compounds evidenced that extracts are not volatile.

PREVALENCE OF POLYMORPHIC CYP2D6 ALLELE 4 IN THE PUERTO RICAN POPULATION
Nathalie Fuentes
Jose Gautier Benitez High School, Caguas, PUERTO RICO

Anti-depression therapy is a common but also a potentially harmful therapeutic intervention. CYP2D6 is known as a key enzyme in the in vivo metabolism of medicines including antidepressants. Subjects who are poor metabolizers may be more susceptible than extensive metabolizers to those drugs that are substrates of the CYP2D6 enzyme, which shows a gene-dosage effect. The purpose of this study is to develop a pharmacogenetic (PGt)-guided approach to optimize dosage in patients taking antidepressants in Puerto Rico. This study explores the hypothesis that patients who are extensive metabolizers receive little benefit from standard dosages of antidepressants due to their higher ability to break down these drugs. Accordingly, the first step in this effort should be to assess the presence of specific CYP2D6 genetic variants. In this study the CYP2D6*4 allelic variant was analyzed because it is one of the most common variant alleles in other populations. The presence of the CYP2D6*4 was evaluated in human newborn DNA samples (ca. 86) obtained from Guthrie cards. The samples were randomly and anonymously collected and had a coded number as the only identifier. Genotyping was carried out on peripheral leukocyte DNAs by molecular biology techniques (i.e., DNA isolation, PCR, restriction-enzyme digestion and DNA analysis by electrophoresis). Fifteen of the 86 subjects were heterozygous and two subjects were homozygous for the *4 allele. The CYP2D6*4 allele frequency among Puerto Rican newborns tested was 11.04%, while the genotype frequency was .012. Puerto Rican population had an intermediate frequency level when compared to other populations.

WOULD A NATURAL ANTISEPTIC BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE COMMON ALCOHOL ANTISEPTIC IN ELIMINATING E. COLI, ATCC(25922) AND S. AUREUS ATCC(29213)?
Zuleika de Jesus-Rodriguez
Francisco Ramos Sanchez, Utuado, PUERTO RICO

This investigation was formulated in order to identify the effectiveness of a natural antiseptic, prepared with lemon juice, orange juice, eucalyptus oil, and vinegar, against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as compared with a common alcohol antiseptic. All the ingredients used have bacteria killing properties. The two bacteria used are commonly found in the human body. The E. coli bacteria are considered an opportunistic pathogen; and can produce infections. The S. aureus are commonly found in the air, water, and the skin. The hypothesis was that the natural antiseptic will be equally effective as the common alcohol antiseptic eliminating E. coli and S. aureus bacteria but with less secondary effects. <br><br>The natural antiseptic was prepared mixing 12 mL of every ingredient, creating a homogeneous solution of 48 mL. One mL of the homogenous solution and one bacterial colony were mixed with a 10 ul inoculating loop. The mixture was stirred for 30 seconds and streaked on a Blood Agar with a 10 ul loop. It was incubated at 35 Celsius degrees. After 24/48 hours results were read. These steps were repeated at 60 seconds, 2 and 3 minutes with the bacteria E. coli 25922 and S. aureus 25922. <br><br>The natural antiseptic was effective against E. coli at 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 2 and 3 minutes and against S. aureus at 2 and 3 minutes. It was concluded that the natural antiseptic prepared with lemon juice, orange juice, eucalyptus oil, and vinegar was successful in eliminating E. coli and S. aureus.

CATECHIN'S ANTI-ANGIOGENIC EFFECTS IN EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER
Brian McTaggart Krug
John F. Ross C.V.I., Guelph, Ontario, CANADA

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a common and highly lethal disease that progresses by inducing angiogenesis (blood vessel growth). Catechin, a polyphenol from green tea, has potential anti-angiogenic effects in vitro. Catechin’s effects on angiogenesis and the tumor environment were examined from a syngeneic model of EOC in vivo. Murine ovarian tumors that had been treated with IP injections of catechin at 20,50 and 100 mg/kg body weight for 30 days were obtained. These tissues were analyzed through immunological techniques to quantify tissue expression of factors regulating angiogenesis and tumour growth: CD31 and IB4 endothelial cell (EC) markers, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptor VEGFR-2, anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and its receptor CD36, Bcl-2 and Fas-ligand. The MTT viability assay and scratch assay determined catechin’s effect on EC proliferation and migration. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, catechin inhibited angiogenesis by 37% in overall tissue sections, and by 46% in tumour areas excluding follicles (p value=0.002588). The same dose inhibited the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 by 50%. At 20-50 mg/kg, catechin induced TSP-1 and CD36 by 27%-30% while inhibiting VEGFR-2 by 50%. However, 100 mg/kg of catechin increased EC proliferation in the MTT assay and in histological staining, and increased VEGF by 45%. These effects could be linked to antioxidant properties and allelopathic functions in plants. This investigation suggests that 20 mg/kg of catechin could prevent EOC, elicit therapeutic benefits as a chemoadjuvant, and reduce the growth and metastasis of advanced tumors through its anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects.

Do older children confuse medicines for candies or candies for medicine?<br><br>Ten common medicines and ten candies were collected, glued on index cards, shellacked, and labeled in pencil on the back of the cards. The letters "M" and "C" were written on the back of the card so responses from the subjects, all ages, could be tallied. The subjects were interviewed individually. Each index card was candy or medicine. Each age was tallied using a color pencil representing their age group so the results could be calculated according to school grade.<br><br>The responses from each subject were tallied to see if the older subjects had a better response rate differentiating medicine from candy. The number of subjects available proved to be the most difficult obstacle in the project. Only 20 subjects were interviewed which resulted in a margin of error of 22.4%. If more subjects were interviewed, the error rate would be much lower. Time was the deciding factor in selecting only 20 subjects.<br><br>No grade was 100% in identifying medicines and candies. Age was not a major factor between 3rd graders and 5th graders. One needs to be extremely careful with medications within a household since many older children can easily mistake medicine for candy.

APTAMER-CONJUGATED GOLD NANORODS FOR PERSONALIZED DETECTION AND NANOTHERMAL TREATMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA CANCER CELLS
Muna Oli
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

Selectively targeted nanothermal radiation differs from traditional cancer treatment in two main ways: by targeting specific cancer cells, and localizing treatment. This research focused on the ability to selectively target cancer cells (and cancer stem cells) by targeting the cancer with an aptamer/gold nanorod conjugate (A-GNR). This nano-bio molecule emits heat when excited by a harmless near infrared (NIR) laser and kills cancer cells, allowing for a selective and targeted treatment. The objective of my research was to synthesize the aptamer and gold nanorods, then test its targeted specificity and ability to kill Glioblastoma (GBM) cancer cells. My research showed that selective targeting and killing of aptamer conjugated gold nanorods was possible to kill Glioblastoma cancer cells. Aptamers had a 99% binding affinity with GBM cells, and dramatically decreased the number of cancer cells when the A-GNR was exposed to the NIR laser.

DOES WHEY PROTEIN EFFECT A RAT'S WEIGHT AND ACTIVITY LEVEL?
Travis Robert Clay
La Plata R-II High School, La Plata, MO

In American, many fitness-minded adults believe that adding whey protein to their diet enhances muscle development and energy. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ingesting whey protein on weight and activity in mature rats. The study included eight well-socialized female rats of comparable size and age (7 months), randomly assigned to either the test or control group. Baseline weights were recorded on all rats. Each rat was housed separately in a research-quality exercise cage, which included an individual housing area adjacent to an exercise wheel equipped with a lap counter to record activity level. Each of the eight cages included its own continuous-supply food bin and water bottle, while the cages of the 4 rats assigned to the test group also included a second fluid bottle for the whey protein mixture. The rats, each distinctly marked, were kept in these separate cages except during a 30-minute period daily, when they were placed in a group cage for socialization with each other and with me as their handler. Weekly weight and activity readings were recorded. While I had predicted that the rat’s provided whey protein would gain more weight and be more active than rats in the control group, data from the study revealed no significant variation in weight or activity between the test group and control group. Further investigation is warranted, including a larger sample size and longer test period, to determine if these dietary benefits of whey protein may be overstated.

REGULATION OF THE LATENT-LYTIC SWITCH OF EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS BY MIRNAS AND TGF-BETA
Iris J. Xu
James Madison Memorial High School, Madison, WI

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma herpesvirus that infects 90% of the world’s population. After primary infection, the virus usually remains latent. Unfortunately, latent EBV infection is frequently associated with several malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some gastric cancers. It was previously shown that treatment of the EBV-positive, B-lymphocytic cell line, MutuI, with the natural ligand TGF-beta leads to lytic reactivation of the virus. Additionally, it was shown that the cellular protein ZEB1 plays a key role in maintenance of EBV latency, with loss of ZEB1 leading to EBV lytic replication. Here, I show that EBV can be reactivated out of latency into lytic replication either by treating EBV-positive 293-D cells with the cellular micro(mi) RNA 200b or 429 or by treating EBV-positive MutuI cells with the natural ligand TGF-beta. However, whereas these miRNAs reactivate EBV in the 293B95.8 cells by down-regulating the level of ZEB1 repressor protein, thereby enabling expression of the EBV lytic immediate-early BZLF1 gene, TGF-beta achieves BZLF1 gene expression in the MutuI cell line, instead, by turning on the Smad signaling pathway, leading to changes via phosphorylation in the transcriptional activities of these proteins. I also show that treating MutuI cells with a combination of TGF-beta and the thymidine analog ganciclovir can lead to increased killing of these cancer cells. These findings, defining mechanisms by which TGF-beta and miRNAs signal EBV lytic replication, could lead to the development of new drugs for treating patients with EBV-associated cancers by lytic induction therapies.

NOTHIN' COOLS ME DOWN LIKE A HOT CUP O' TEA
Chris Lee Weeks
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

The purpose of my experiment was to see whether it is better to drink hot, cold, or room temperature water after exercise. I think that the hot water will lower your body temperature the fastest. First I took the temperature, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure of 15 test subjects. I then had them jog on a tread mill for 10 minutes at a rate of 6 miles per hour. After the jog i took their vitals again and then had 5 of my subjects drink either cold water (8oC, 46.6oF), room temperature water (15oC, 59oF), or hot water (50oC,122oF). As soon as they finished the water I took their vitals again and I took them again every 2 minutes for 10 minutes after they drank the water. My variable was the different temperatures of water. Based on my tests, I can conclude that hot water lowers the body temperature more often than either the cold or room temperature water. With the hot water, 27 of the body temperatures went down and only 7 body temperatures went up. With cold water, only 13 body temperatures went down and 21 body temperatures went up. With room temperature water, 17 of the body temperatures went down and 16 body temperatures went up. In conclusion, my results show that hot water does cool you down faster that cold or room temperature water. My hypothesis that the hot water would cool you down faster was correct. Cold water may make you feel more refreshed but hot water may actually be more beneficial.

THE EFFICACY OF GENE CELL THERAPY USING CD11B+ MONOCYTES TRANSFECTED WITH PROTEASE AS A TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE, 3RD YEAR STUDY
Jasmine Samaiya Roberts
Paul R. Wharton High School, Tampa, FL

This research investigates if amyloid-Beta (AB) plaque, which causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD), can be reduced when transfected cells are implanted into Alzheimer’s Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) transgenic mice. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if monocytes can be used as a vehicle for transporting therapeutic genes as a treatment to reduce Alzheimer’s AB plaque pathology. Over 5 million Americans suffer with AD. The significance of developing a new treatment for AD will 1)save taxpayers millions of dollars in healthcare costs, 2)improve the quality of life for Alzheimer’s victims, and 3)increase the survival rate of individuals.<br><br>This experiment utilized the brain tissue of three groups: 1)Insulin Degrading Enzyme Secreted (IDE-S), 2)Neprilysin Secreted (NEP-S), and 3)Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). This investigation consisted of the extraction of monocytes from bone marrow, separation of CD11b+ monocytes (centrifuge), and addition of enzyme protease (IDE-S or NEP-S) and protein (RFP) to monocytes that were used as a vehicle for transporting therapeutic genes as a treatment. The fluorescent immunostaining for GFP demonstrated that the CD11b+ monocytic cells migrated across the blood-brain barrier into the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Both ABeta immunostaining and Congo Red stain were used for further imaging analysis.<br><br>The results of this experiment supported the researcher’s hypothesis and revealed that when Alzheimer’s APP mice received monocytes tranfected with the proteases IDE-S or NEP-S, there was a significantly decreasing trend in AB plaque in the brain. This means these protease enzymes can lower the AB plaque and possibly improve memory loss when used as a therapeutic gene treatment.

ERROR IN MRI: BIAS, RANDOM ERROR, AND THE POWER OF SUGGESTION
Diane Elizabeth Schulze
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

False positives are prevalent in MRI imaging, yet it is still a trusted diagnostic tool (Hoogerbrugge). With high potential for random error, doctors are said to “see what they’re looking for” when evaluating images, rather than viewing them objectively. The purpose of the experiment was to determine just how swayed doctors are by patient histories when asked to evaluate images alone.<br><br> T1- and T2-weighted images of a healthy brain were obtained. A set of patient information indicative of edema was fabricated. Approximately one-half of image packets to be distributed were paired with patient information. Packets were distributed to approximately 35 doctors, who were asked to make judgments or diagnoses based on the images (they were not instructed to use the histories). Doctors were asked for information regarding their education, job experience, and specialization. Completed surveys were grouped according to history and compared: how much does patient history bias evaluation, and are certain types of bias correlated with factors such as education?<br><br> Inclusion of an abnormal patient history was strongly associated with increased likelihood of abnormal diagnosis. Among packets where diagnoses were made, edema represented the plurality of the diagnoses. Cerebral edema is one of the most common diagnoses made with the help of MRI, in particular T2-weighted imaging (Bradley). The prevalence of this diagnosis, in conjunction with the fact that it is one commonly made, seems to support that there is lack of critical information processing when evaluating MRI if a doctor believes he knows what to look for.

THE EFFECTS OF THE ANTIOXIDANT N-ACETYL CYSTEINE ON BREAST CANCER TUMOR-INITIATING CELL GROWTH
Steve Charles
Coconut Creek High School, Coconut Creek, FL

It is believed that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generally higher in cancerous cells than in normal cells. Existing research has identified a class of cells called tumor initiating cells which demonstrate resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and contribute to tumor maintenance. It has been hypothesized that the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can reduce the ROS levels in tumor initiating cancer cells, leading to cell death. The purpose of this study was to assess the response of tumor initiating cells in the presence of varying dosages of NAC. Normal mammalian cancer cells and tumor initiating cells (spheric cells) were exposed to varying dosages of two antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and coenzyme Q10 (Q10). Results from the work done on both normal and spheric cells indicate that the greatest decreases in cell proliferation occurred in instances of greatest exposure to NAC and Q10. The researcher’s next goal will be to correlate ROS levels to cancer cell growth.

THE EFFECTS OF OXYGEN ON SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL FUNCTION: A POTENTIAL ROLE IN PREVENTING INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA
Ashley Rebecca Santilli, Emily Bostrom, 
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, MN

This experiment was primarily conducted to use oxygen to stop proliferation and the production of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in smooth muscle cells (SMC) to prevent intimal hyperplasia. Cells were cultured in hypoxia (5% oxygen), normoxia (21% oxygen), and hyperoxia (30% oxygen) conditions to measure the difference in SMC proliferation in accordance to the oxygen level. Four main experiments were conducted to answer the main problem. The first was a scratch test which consisted of plating cells and uniformly scratching each plate with a pipette tip. The cells were incubated in the three oxygen levels for twenty-four and forty-eight hours. Proliferation was observed and quantified using BrdU staining methods. The second experiment measured SMC VEGF protein. The cells grew to confluence in the three oxygen environments. The supernatant was then analyzed using ELISA for VEGF. The third experiment measured RNA production for VEGF receptor 1 and receptor 2. To measure this, standard procedures of Real-Time PCR were used. The final experiment was a measurement of VEGF receptor 2 protein and VEGF protein in SMC. Five antibodies were used: HIF-1a, VEGF, Flt-1(VEGFR1), Flk-1(VEGFR2), and B-actin. Standard Western-Blot protocol was used to measure the proteins. The data from each experiment led to the conclusion that SMC treated under hyperoxic conditions most effectively stopped proliferation and VEGF production in SMC which would lead to the prevention of intimal hyperplasia.

EXPANDING A GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE FOR THEILER’S VIRUS AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Ava Kathryn Mokhtari, Addison Weiler, 
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Currently, there are no genetic tests that can detect multiple sclerosis, which is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 2.5 million people worldwide. The purpose of our research was to develop a gene-expression profile for Theiler’s virus. Theiler’s virus produces a variant of multiple sclerosis found in mice (Mus musculus), and because Theiler's virus is a model in mice for multiple sclerosis in humans, the data we collected on Theiler’s virus can be used to diagnose patients with multiple sclerosis more quickly than currently used diagnostic methods. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to measure gene-expression levels in eighteen genes from M. musculus that had been infected with Theiler’s virus. Results indicated significant changes in gene expression of twelve of the eighteen genes tested (p < 0.05). Results on the twelve genes will be added to a gene-expression profile that has been developed for Scrapie prion disease and is currently being developed for transgenic Alzheimer’s disease. When the full expression profile for all three diseases is completed, the profile will eventually be used in a clinical study to differentiate and definitively diagnose these neurodegenerative diseases quickly and efficiently.

ENCAPSULATE TO MITIGATE: A STUDY OF THE CONTROLLED RELEASE OF FITC-DEXTRAN MICROENCAPSULATED IN PLGA
Varun Akella Koneru, Shantanu Banerjee, 
Westwood High School, Austin, TX

Today, capsules and medicine are everyday occurrences. Generally, people fill prescriptions for hundreds -of pills all of which last no more than a few weeks. The reason for this is because most current drugs -lack the use of microencapsulation procedures to control their release over an extended period of time. New technology has made it possible to create micro and nanospheres that range in size from sub micron to are tens of micrometers and dissolve slowly. Such microparticle-based strategies could be used to deliver drugs in slow and sustained manner over a long period of time, thereby reducing the need for multiple administrations. To address this issue we evaluated, whether a drug of interest can be encapsulated within microparticles formed by a biodegradable material (polymer) known as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or PLGA. As a model drug, we employed a fluorescently tagged sugar-based molecule known as FITC dextran. Similarity in molar masses is important because it is what influences its release from the microparticles over time. The release is measured in an aqueous buffer at 37OC to mimic the physiological drug release conditions. The results obtained so far show successful formation of uniform microparticles and encapsulation of the model drug.

POTENTIAL OF BARNACLE CEMENT IN DENTISTRY
Timothy Jie Han Sng, Ang Qianbo Joseph, Lee Jian Xing Clement
Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore, SINGAPORE

The barnacle adheres tenaciously to underwater substrata by secreting an adhesive known as barnacle cement. Lauded for its mechanical properties and water insolubility, barnacle cement was further explored in this study for its potential in dental application. Its biocompatibility, speed of polymerization, aesthetic appeal and acid-resistance were investigated. Biocompatibility of barnacle cement was determined through toxicity assays with the flat worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism for toxicity tests. Aesthetic appeal of barnacle cement was then investigated through visual analysis of the cement on teeth. The effect of Ca2+ ions and electromagnetic radiations on cement polymerization time was also studied. To determine acid-resistance, teeth coated with barnacle cement were immersed in an acidic beverage and alterations were observed. Our results showed that barnacle cement did not induce death of C. elegans. Morphological analysis of the cement on teeth further indicated that it was of similar color to the natural shade of teeth, making it aesthetically appealing. Rate of barnacle cement polymerization was also found to be hastened with the use of catalysts, specifically in the presence of Ca2+ ions under infra-red radiation. The cement, however, was not resistant against long-term exposure to strongly acidic conditions. Thus, at present, the applicability of barnacle cement as a dental adhesive is constrained. Still, with further research on enhancing acid-tolerance and polymerization rate, the application of effective barnacle cement based dental adhesives and sealants is indeed possible.

STOMP OUT CHLAMYDIA!
Tatiana Vladimirovna Lupashina, Audrey Jaquiss, Chrystal Lau
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Chlamydia, one of the most commonly reported sexually transmitted diseases, affects over 95 million people a year, making it a crucial area for study. The cause of the disease is a bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis that enters the epithelial cells by endocytosis, evades lysosomal degradation and replicates inside the inclusion bodies. During many stages of it’s development, Chlamydia actively exploits the intracellular trafficking machinery of the host cell. We propose to investigate which components of Golgi trafficking machinery in human cells are used by the Chlamydia. Non-pathogenic Chlamydia muridarum strain was employed for all studies. Immunofluorescent microscopy was used to localize Golgi trafficking proteins gamma-COP, Giantin, Cog8, Rab6, TGN46, and GS15 in Chlamydia infected HeLa cells. It was observed that Rab6, Cog8, TGN46, and GS15 were colocalized with Chlamydia inclusions. The synthesis of Rab6 and Cog8 proteins was inhibited in HeLa cells infected with Chlamydia to test if their absence would affect Chlamydia development. To confirm an efficiency of knock down of these proteins, a Western Blot was performed. Both Rab6 and Cog8 knockdowns showed a significant decrease in production of infectious Chlamydia units and a dramatic decrease in a number of Chlamydia inclusions, though increasing the size of inclusions. These results demonstrate that both proteins are exploited by Chlamydia during its infection and growth in host cell. Development of new drugs that would target specific interactions between parasite and host cell’s proteins would be a significant step in protecting humankind against infectious diseases.

MESENCHYMAL GENES ARE UPREGULATED IN PUTATIVE MURINE MAMMARY CANCER STEM CELLS
Rachel Ann Wilkinson, Katie McShane, 
Nicolet High School, Milwaukee, WI

The purpose of this experiment is to genetically characterize putative cancer stem cells within a population of murine mammary cancer cells. Cancer stem cells are characterized by increased tumorigenecity and a resistance to common cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation. This project focuses on a specific population of murine mammary cancer cells that express a low level of CD24, a cell surface marker. Cells expressing a low level of CD24 have been shown to have the most stem cell potential. By analyzing the gene expression of these cells, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the genetic makeup of breast cancer stem cells and the conditions under which they develop. <br><br>A cultured population of cells harvested from a spontaneous mammary tumor was sorted via flow cytometry according to their expression of Neu, an oncogene, and CD24. We isolated cells with a Neulow/CD24low phenotype and hypothesized these cells would express a high level of several genes associated with mesenchymal cells, the loosely connected cells that have been recently linked to the metastasis of breast cancer. We tested the DNA of the Neulow/CD24low cells in comparison to the Neuhigh/CD24high cells using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Our results show that Slug, Twist, Zeb1, and Zeb2, genes that are commonly up-regulated in mesenchymal cells, were expressed at a higher level within the Neulow/CD24low population. Our conclusion demonstrates a clear correlation between a cancer stem cell phenotype and the expression of mesenchymal genes.

ASK PEAT: DETERMINING IF ONLINE MUSIC VIDEOS ARE SAFE FOR TEENS WITH PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY
Annelise Cummings, Mariah Bruns, Alexander Harding
Cleveland High School, Portland, OR

Photosensitive epilepsy is a condition more common among teens than adults, where visual stimuli trigger seizures. This study used the Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT), developed by the Trace Center, to determine if online music videos are safe for teens with photosensitive epilepsy. <br><br> We chose the top song of 2009, "Boom Boom Pow" by the Black Eyed Peas, as an audio constant for selecting videos. We sampled three groups of YouTube videos commonly viewed by teenagers, specifically, animated music videos, montages, and parodies. We compared them to videos with “seizure warning” labels. We expected few videos without a “seizure warning” label to fail PEAT. <br><br> As expected, videos with “seizure warning” labels had significantly more defects than other videos. Unexpectedly, montage and animation videos failed at the same rate as videos marked “seizure warning” (90-95%), and 86% of unlabeled videos failed. In other words, a teen avoiding labeled videos would have less than a one in seven chance of picking a video without defects. <br><br> Our results suggest that YouTube broadcasters do not adequately warn viewers of potentially harmful flashing. Currently, online music videos are unscreened, inadequately labeled, and consequently watching them is an unsafe activity for teens with photosensitive epilepsy.

NEUTRALIZATION OF E. COLI LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE WITH A NOVEL RECOMBINANT ASS PROTEIN TREATMENT
Alvin Wang, Gabriel Molina, 
Oak Hall School, Gainesville, FL

Escherichia coli (E. coli) belongs to a group of pathogenic bacteria called gram-negative enterobacteria. Enterobacteria infections can be food borne or could come from a wound or surgery. A molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is released from the outer membrane of the E. coli into the blood stream. LPS, in turn, binds to the host cells such as macrophages through the CD14 receptor, triggering a cascade of systemic responses. <br><br>Liver cells produce a protein Agininosuccinate Synthase (ASS), which has been suggested to bind to LPS. We thus hypothesize that ASS protein could potentially bind to and neutralize LPS and thus protect cultured mouse macrophages and animals treated with E. Coli LPS. To test this hypothesis, we first produced and purified a recombinant form of human ASS protein. Cell culture experiments we conducted showed that even 1 h delayed treatment with recombinant ASS successfully protected macrophage cells from LPS-mediated cell activation, including reducing vacuole formation and LDH release, and preserving mitochondrial functions. In addition, recombinant ASS protein also had direct suppressive effects on E. coli growth in culture.<br><br>To further test if recombinant ASS has similar neutralizing effects in animals, our Qualified Scientist administered LPS to rodents with co-or delayed treatment of recombinant ASS (we produced), recorded responses and collected samples to test if recombinant ASS has similar neutralizing effects in animals. We then assayed rat plasma rat plasma samples collected for pro-inflammatory protein levels, we found that co- or delayed treatment of recombinant ASS could prevent LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory proteins (TNF-α, C-RP) and cellular LDH protein. These data also correspond well to the reduced animal responses towards LPS administration we calculated. Thus, these findings show that recombinant ASS could be further developed into a protein drug candidate neutralizing enterobacterial LPS in humans.

INTERNAL COMBAT WITH MELANOMA: TRIGGERING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH THE UP-REGULATION OF FAS USING TOLL LIGAND COMBINATION TREATMENTS
Tonya Alexia Pavlenko, Laura Gudvangen,

Melanoma is one of the most aggressively metastasizing forms of skin cancer; in the United States alone there are nearly 70,000 new cases of melanoma reported each year. The current and general treatment options of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are invasive and strenuous on the human body.<br><br>This project, in its present form, has discovered and pinpointed the immune recognition process that stimulates melanoma cell death through toll ligand combination treatments. The study explored multiple toll ligand combination treatment options and tested for multiple receptor and ligand expressions on both melanoma and lymphocytes. The stimulation and discovery of the FAS death inducing signaling complex supported the hypothesis demonstrating that the toll ligand combination PIC/R848 treatment was most effective in inducing melanoma apoptosis through the increased FAS expression on both melanoma and lymphocytes. <br><br>The presence of protein expression was determined through the process of staining for the specific proteins FAS, CD74, Class I, and Class II. Melanoma and lymphocytes interacted in vitro and demonstrated the extent of immunogenicity of both cell types following treatment. The expression of FAS, CD74, Class I, and Class II was determined through the calculation of the geo mean in terms of percent maximum protein expression. Flocytometer analysis established numbers of cell death thus demonstrating which treatment was most effective in inducing apoptosis through the up-regulation of signaling proteins.<br><br>This strategy of toll ligand combination treatment, which stimulates the FAS death inducing signaling complex, allows the immune system to recognize melanoma and combat it internally, thus avoiding the detrimental effects of current melanoma treatment opttions

THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT THERAPY ON THE GROWTH OF PROPIONIBACTERIUM ACNES AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS
Christine Joy Paguio Tan, Christine Gail Paguio Tan, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this project was to test the effectiveness of incandescent lights: blue (415nm), red (660nm), red/blue, and UVA light (320nm) on eliminating acne causing bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The hypothesis was that the red/blue light would be most effective in killing both bacteria. This was tested by exposing nutrient agar plates or blood agar plates depending on the bacteria, to the specified lights. Then a colony count of the bacteria was taken after being cultures in either aerobic conditions or in an anaerobic culture chamber. Also, a second method to determine the inhibition of the bacteria was conducted by exposing the broth of both bacteria to the lights. The turbidity of each broth was measured over a period of three days with a spectrophotometer. Higher turbidity indicates a greater presence of bacteria. <br><br> The samples exposed to the blue light had the greatest growth inhibition for the plating technique for both bacteria. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported. These results were the same in the broth technique for both bacteria. Blue light exposure had the best inhibition of bacterial growth, followed by the red/blue light exposure, and lastly exposure to red light. The P. acnes exposed to blue light showed less bacterial growth after three days of incubation, indicating the bacterial growth was successfully inhibited. The remaining sample solutions for both bacteria had about the same optical density as the control. In conclusion, some bacterial growth was inhibited, diminishing acne causing bacteria, but not fully eliminating them.

GENERATION OF A RNA PROBE FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION
Kelly Kathleen Christensen, Molly McMahon, 
Monarch High School, Louisville, CO

Type-1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the white blood cells destroys the β- cells in the pancreas, resulting in insulin dependency because glucose can no longer be metabolized. This project’s purpose was to determine if zinc transporter isoform 8 (ZnT8) is β- cell specific and is a possible immunological target in the development of type-1 diabetes mellitus. ZnT8 is a protein specifically related to the secretion and maturation of insulin in the pancreas. If in situ hybridization demonstrates that gene expression is β- cell specific, then we can state that ZnT8 expression and function is pancreatic β- cell specific. Using recombinant DNA technology, we isolated RNA from pancreatic islet cells. From that we used first strand synthesis to create a purified copy DNA (cDNA) strand where we destroyed the RNA. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to exponentially amplify the ZnT8 gene sequence using specific primers. After using gel electrophoresis as a negative control we used transformation (the uptake of genetic material) to insert the ZnT8 fragment into a bioengineered vector. We then cultured our bacterial vector and purified the DNA plasmid as a template for an in situ probe. DNA sequencing verified the correct 145 base-pair ZnT8 fragment then used to generate a fluorescence probe. We expect in situ hybridization to localize the presence of the ZnT8 gene within pancreatic β-cells. If successful, the β-cell and ZnT8 will demonstrate specificity. Determining ZnT8 localization is a step in discovering if this gene is in fact an immunological target for the development of type-1 diabetes.

A NOVEL GALLIUM AND ZINC NITRATE BASED INTRAVENOUS MEDICINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS
Aditya Samir Mazmudar, Atif Javed, 
Fairfax High School, Fairfax, VA

In light of the rising numbers of nosocomial infections and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa’s intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, this research project seeks to employ a Gallium and Zinc nitrate-based substance to eradicate bio film production by using a “Trojan Horse” technique. <br><br>This project will be exploiting the Fe respiration system by using these elements’ redox capabilities, because of their similarities to iron, to enter the bacterium and slowly break down the organism from the inside out. It is anticipated that if this novel treatment is applied to the bacteria then it will have an exterminatory effect.<br><br>P. Aeruginosa was cultured and applied to 67 petri dishes with TSA and 5% Sheep’s Blood. Independent dosages of zinc and gallium were tested starting from 1.0 mg to 15.0 mg using the Kirby-Bauer procedural method. Individual treatment dosages were combined to form ratio tests that examined which amounts and ratios were optimal. These dishes were left in incubators at the NIH Clinical Center and the virulence and durability of the dosages was analyzed using calipers.<br><br>This study successfully proved that Gallium Nitrate and Zinc Nitrate are viable prospects for the treatment of infections caused by these bacteria. Gallium Nitrate had a more potent and sustained effect on the bacteria, whereas Zinc Nitrate had a more immediate and increasing effect. The quantitative data and statistical analysis from the experiment validate our original hypothesis and support that, generally, as the dosage increased, the size of the zone of inhibition increased with both individual and ratio tests. In the future, more dosages could be tested and the pharmacology and toxicology of these elements as medicines could be examined through clinical trials.

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS: THE EFFECT ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY, BRAIN VOLUMES AND COGNITION IN ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS
Marcela Lizeth Erazo, Lauren Browne, 
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

Atherosclerotic risk factors have been shown to result in an increased risk for a faster progression of dementia. It has been shown that such risk factors lead to a decrease in white matter brain volumes as well as cognitive performance. Although the individual effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia have been explored in subjects who did not display normal cognitive functioning, the effect of both risk factors on normal subjects has not yet been studied. Furthermore, the effect of such cardiovascular risk factors on pathological biomarkers of dementia including IP levels, Amyloid-Beta, and tau measurements have not been analyzed. Previous studies have not been able to show a consistent association between hypertension and reduced grey matter in normal subjects. Our study provides evidence to support the relationship between hypertension and low gray matter volumes in normal subjects (P=.037). Moreover, our study strengthens the association between hypercholesterolemia and increased IP levels in the CSF (P=.044), as well as the association between the combination of both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on grey matter volumes (P=.005). This unprecedented study successfully shows the effect of both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on the progression of dementia in normal subjects and leads to future longitudinal studies to follow the cognitive advancement in these subjects.

CAUTION! YOU ARE NOT SITTING RIGHT!: A PAD THAT GUIDES YOU TO THE RIGHT SITTING POSTURE
Hayfa Khaled Al Bassam, Aminah Saleh AlSaihati, Tyma Mohammed Hezam
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, Eastern Province, SAUDI ARABIA

Many people in the world think that sitting with your back forced up right is the ideal sitting posture... Well, its not! The wrong sitting posture leads to hazardous short and long term effects, which vary from head-aches to scoliosis. <br><br>After researching that most back problems are caused by the wrong sitting posture, we thought that if we designed a medical solution to alert humans of a better sitting posture, it will reduce back pain and prevent any future back-aches. “The Back Pad” we’ve created helps reduce back-aches and prevent any future back maladies, which affects over 80% of persons over the age of 18. <br><br>The Back Pad’s working strategy is when the user sits correctly, the LED will activate to notify the user that his\her sitting posture is fine, if the posture is not correct, LED will not activate. The right sitting posture is defined by 4 force-pressure sensors that are placed on the spots that should be pressured while sitting the right posture. These pressure sensors are placed in locations that have been researched as the most critical posture areas for a healthy backbone. Also, we’ve attached a timer, which rings every 20 minutes, to remind users to maintain the right sitting posture.<br><br> To prove that the Back Pad works, we measured the user’s pain before and after using the pad with the help of a pain scale. With calculating and analyzing, we assured that the pad is the perfect solution for any back maladies.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF ADRENAL FATIGUE ON DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS
Caroline Couvillion, Caroline Grand, 
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

Adrenal Fatigue is when stress is exerted on the body to the extent of a serious illness. A person’s health and wellness may depend on the amount of fatigue their body experiences. The research hypothesis was proved true: a person’s age determines how much adrenal fatigue, stress acquired on the body, they have. An older person will have more adrenal fatigue. The experiment took place at St. Aloysius School and St. Joseph’s Academy. Friends, teachers, and relatives of the student researchers completed a questionnaire about Adrenal Fatigue. The test subjects were divided into three age groups: middle school eighth grade students, high school sophomore students, and adults (ages 18 and over). Their scores determined whether they had Adrenal Fatigue or not. If they did display Adrenal Fatigue, their scores also determined how severe it was. Finally, statistics were done for the analysis of the three age groups’ scores. The results of the data concluded that the adults have more stress leading to Adrenal Fatigue than the other groups. The middle school eighth grade students suffer the least from Adrenal Fatigue consequently making them the healthiest of the test subjects. This experiment was designed to figure out ‘who has the most stress?’ and see how the stress affects them.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS IN POTENTIAL CARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS
Tyler Lee Nelson, Margaret Wilmouth, Kenda Laber
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a strain of S. aureus bacteria that is antibiotic resistant and potentially deadly to humans. In the past three decades, MRSA infections have shown an increase of 32-fold in the United States. The objective of this study was to screen for MRSA in a small number of individuals in both high and low risk populations in Billings, Montana. Nares swabs were performed on individuals in high-risk groups; high school wrestlers, residents of a retirement home, registered nurses, and children at a day care. High-risk groups are defined as individuals who encounter frequent skin to skin contact or live in close quarters. Low-risk groups tested included high school golfers, elderly individuals living in solitude, infrequent visitors of the hospital, and children who do not attend a day care facility.<br><br> Swabs were streaked on blood agar, and colonies which tested positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were retested for MRSA. MSSA was indentified in all of the ten groups tested. One individual, a resident of the retirement home, tested positive for MRSA. The fact that a positive MRSA was detected in such a small sample size suggests that MRSA may be relatively common in our community, and indicates that more intensive MRSA screening in Billings is needed. Awareness of this situation is a first step toward implementation of rigorous sanitation protocols in public areas such as schools, day cares, and retirement homes to help contain MRSA and protect vulnerable populations.

REMOTE ISCHEMIC PRECONDITIONING
Anshum Sood, Naman Gupta, Anuhya Ghorakavi
Folsom High School, Folsom, CA

Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) refers to a brief period of sub-lethal ischemia applied to a remote organ/tissue that confers protection against a subsequent lethal ischemia. The mechanisms whereby RIPC affords protection remain to be fully elucidated. However, previous studies have a reported an anti-platelet effect following RIPC in animals in conjunction with reduced lesion volumes. As such, in the present study we describe a RIPC paradigm in human subjects. Briefly, a blood pressure cuff was applied to the upper arm and three 5 min inflation and 5 min rest period were applied. Bleeding time and platelet aggregation (in response to collagen and ADP) were measured at baseline and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours and 7 days after the RIPC event. Following RIPC, subjects were observed to have an increased bleeding time and a decrease in the rate of platelet aggregation. These changes occurred early after the RIPC event and resolved by the 7 day time point. In addition, there appeared to be gender differences in the response to preconditioning, with males responding with an increase in bleeding time earlier (4 hours) than females (24 hours). These findings may have implications for the reduction of injury in tissue ischemia.

THE EFFECTS OF CALORIC RESTRICTION ON THE SUBSEQUENT STRESS RESISTANCE AND CHEMOSENSATION OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Priyanka Athavale, Sudarshan Bhat, 
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, displays sensitivity to certain stressors, such as heat, oxidative stress and caloric restriction. Our experiment looked into three aspects of caloric restriction as a stressor of C. elegans. The purpose of Part I of the experiment was to demonstrate the effects of controlled nutrient deprivation on the lifespan of C. elegans. In Part II, we developed a chemotaxis assay in order to efficiently and accurately quantify chemosensation (used as a measure of neural function) of the C. elegans. In Part III, we tested our chemotaxis assay on worms that were starved initially for 24 hours and 48 hours to observe the effects of nutrient deprivation on chemo-sensation. <br><br>Part I of our experimentation demonstrated that worms exposed to longer periods of starvation subsequently showed a decrease to the susceptibility to becoming dauer. In Part II of the study, we determined that our chemotaxis assay worked best using butter flavor as the chemical odorant. In Phase III, the worms were starved, revived, and assayed to measure neurological development using the chemotaxis assay from Phase II. As predicted, Part III showed that longer periods of starvation weaken chemosensation. The data collected in Part I and Phase III implies that reactive oxygen species produced through starvation has disrupted the proper function of the neurons responsible for chemosensation<br><br>Through this research, we have learned that caloric restriction can increase the worms’ resistance to stressors (a sign of increased lifespan), but can cause subsequent negative impacts on the worms’ neurological development as shown by the chemotaxis assays.

ENGINEERING A NOVEL GENETICS-BASED EARLY DISEASE DETECTION MECHANISM DESIGNED USING AN ONTOLOGY-DRIVEN SEMANTICALLY ANNOTATED MICROARRAY REPOSITORY WITH THERMAL GRADIENT FOCUSING MASS SPECTROMETRY
Ritik Malhotra, Tony Ho, 
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

Introduction: Doctors currently use symptoms to determine whether certain diseases are present in a human, which is prone to error and subjectivity. Genetics allow for earlier and accurate diagnosis of diseases. Microarray experiments hold data that inform scientists of genes that cause specific diseases. The problem with current microarray databases is that they are too disorganized and lack semantic enforcement. Mass spectrometry techniques to analyze human tissue samples exist as a viable means to use data from microarray experiments to find diseases, but the current mass spectrometers aren’t sensitive enough to find the diseases at low concentrations, before they become lethal.<br><br> <br><br>Purpose: To identify key biomarkers for diseases by analyzing the genetic changes caused by diseases and to use that information to accurately detect diseases. First, an efficient database to query microarray experiments without inaccurate data is needed. Second, sensitivity in mass spectrometers needs to be improved in order to facilitate the early detection of low abundance biomarkers present in diseases.<br><br> <br><br>Results: The microarray database is successfully created and is able to automatically annotate over 400,000 experiments using common semantics. The KNN-Delta and Semantic Outlier Factor algorithms are able to increase the accuracy of the database, removing 40,000 inaccurately annotated experiments. The mass spectrometry efficiencies resulted in a signal-to-charge ratio increase from 1000:1 to 6800:1, detecting samples as low as 150 femtomoles.<br><br> <br><br>Conclusions: Based on the successful implementation of the microarray database and the sensitivity improvements of the mass spectrometer, it is possible to detect diseases at small concentrations, before they become lethal.

EPIGENETIC BIOMARKER ASSAYS FOR COLON CANCER SCREENING
Benjamin Paul Song, Quan Chen, 
Methacton High School, Eagleville, PA

Although the success of cancer treatment often depends on the early detection of cancer, screening is hindered by low compliance rates for certain invasive screening tests. Previous studies have demonstrated that human urine contains circulation-derived low MW DNA (<300 bp) and that low MW urine DNA can be used to detect cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations. To explore the potential to develop a urine test for cancer screening, we designed PCR-based assays for a known colon cancer epigenetic marker, the aberrant hypermethylation of the vimentin gene (mVIM) and tested its suitability for use with short, fragmented, and circulation-derived low MW urine DNA. It was found that a PCR based assay with a target size of 40 bp could be used for detecting mVIM in low MW DNA and a shorter amplicon could detect mVIM with a higher sensitivity. A blinded concordance study was performed. mVIM was detected in 75% (15/20) of urine samples from patients diagnosed with CRC and 0% (0/10) of urine from healthy controls, and there was a 60% concordance in detecting mVIM between the CRC tissues and corresponding urine samples. A similar approach was used to develop assays for the second CRC epigenetic marker, hypermethylation of integrin alpha 4 gene (mITGA4) toward building a panel of CRC DNA marker for a sensitive and specific urine test for the colon cancer (work in progress). Collectively, our data demonstrates the promising potential of developing a urine test for cancer screening.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDING A PHOTOSENSITIZER TO THE PHOTODYNAMIC TREATMENT OF INFECTED TOOTH ROOTS AND DENTAL IMPLANTS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
Mark Ryan Oppenheimer, Adam Oppenheimer, 
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Photosensitizers absorb and concentrate light energy of specific wavelengths. If a photosensitizing dye were to be retained by pathogenic bacteria, then the application of a laser light to these bacteria may enhance the observed lethal photosensitization. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of the addition of a photosensitizer to photodynamic therapy on the roots of teeth and the surface of dental implants. Under anaerobic conditions, human subgingival bacteria were cultivated and applied to twelve tooth roots and twelve implants. Of these, 6 of each group were treated with a photosensitizer (toluidine blue) before undergoing laser disinfection, and six were treated without the photosensitizer. Still under anaerobic conditions, the samples were grown in a bacterial media. After 4 days, the turbidity of each sample was measured. On average, the tooth roots with the photosensitizer had 28.3 percent lower turbidity than those treated without the photosensitizer, and the implants treated with the photosensitizer had 40.96 percent lower turbidity than those treated without the photosensitizer. These results indicate that the addition of a photosensitizer greatly increases the bacterial reduction on both the tooth roots and dental implants, however the improvement is much more prevalent for the dental implants than it is for the tooth roots. In a statistical analysis, these results were shown to be significant (p< .05). These results show the effectiveness of adding a photosensitizer, and show that in procedures in which bacterial reduction is the main purpose, a photosensitizer should be utilized.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL VISION AND RETINAL CELL RESPONSE
Sanjay Menon, Peter Bau, 
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

Eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, and multiple sclerosis involve the decline of retinal function over the course of the illness. In order to treat such diseases, their severity and quantitative strength of the eyes must be measured using visual acuity (VA), or functional vision. The primary purpose of this study is to define a correlation between functional vision and retinal response, as to detect earlier onset of the disease, opening the door to treatments as meticulous as surgery or as simple as a neuroprotective pill. <br><br>In this study, the C57BL/6 inbred lab mouse is used as the control background strain along with two variable genetic mutations: Retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) and Mer-Knockout (mer-KO). These two strains represent retinal degenerative disorders and were tested using Virtual Optokinetics from the time of eye-opening (approximately postnatal day 15) until total vision loss. <br><br>Over the course of the ocular degeneration, the response to the presented stimuli indicated a definitive decline in visual ability. Maximum measurements of visual acuity were recorded around P21 and began to decline at P24. This decline in functional vision proved to be delayed in comparison to cell response assessments acquired from electroretinogram tests, signifying finer and more sensitive responses can be detected earlier using optokinetics.<br><br>The significance of these findings applies to a large affected population, as approximately 2.3 million American AMD patients alone go undiagnosed in addition to 10 million suffering from RP diseases. Due to these findings, vision decline in subjects diagnosed with AMD and other RDs, can be more accurately and holistically monitored.

THE EFFECTS OF CLOVE OIL ON BACTERIA FOUND ON ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT
Katie Lynn McLaughlin, Dixie Renfrow, 
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL

The purpose of our project is to discover the effects of clove oil on bacteria found on an athletic bench from a workout room. On day 1, we filled 7 spray bottles with different dilutions of clove oil and baby wash, as well as water in one and just baby wash in the one. We then taped off different sections of the athletic bench to separate the different dilutions of clove. Before spraying, we swabbed the bench, then placed the contents in a petri dish and into the incubator for 48 hours. Days 2-3, we found an increase in bacterial growth and altered our project to spray the clove oil dilutions and swab the bench ever day. Days 4-6, we sprayed the bench, swabbed, and recorded the results from the previous days as well as counted all the bacteria that had been found in the petri dishes from the athletic bench. We found that bacteria called Pseudomonas covered the bench, which is a bacteria that attacks the lungs, causing breathing problems. Finally, after the 6 days, we recorded all of the results and came to the conclusion that clove oil is an effective way to diminish bacterial growth on athletic benches.

EFFECTS OF NANOPARTICLES AND NSAIDS ON SP PROTEIN AND SURVIVIN EXPRESSION AFTER RADIATION IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER
Shannon Somer Stockton
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Tolfenamic acid has been identified as an inhibitor of Sp protein expression and potential adjuvant to radiation therapy due to its suppression of up-regulated survivin levels. However, Tolfenamic acid only targets cancer cells and does not protect healthy tissue. In recent studies, nanoparticles have been used to protect tissue from radiation damage, but little work has been done on the effects of nanoparticles on cancer treatment. Based on this knowledge, the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of nanoparticles on the ability of radiation therapy and TA to inhibit Sp1 and survivin expression and induce cell death. The researcher hypothesized cerium oxide nanoparticles will not impair the effectiveness of radiation and Tolfenamic acid. A combination therapy of Tolfenamic acid, radiation, and cerium oxide nanoparticles will potentiate cell proliferation inhibition.<br><br>To test these hypotheses, a cell proliferation assay was performed to determine the effects of nanoparticles alone on cell growth. Concentrations of 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM, and 100 µM were used. Another proliferation assay was performed to determine the effects of the five concentrations of nanoparticles with 100 µM Tolfenamic acid. Finally, a proliferation assay was performed to observe the effects of various combinations of 10 Gy radiation, 100 µM TA, and 100 µM nanoparticles. Then, a western blot protein analysis was performed to check for the levels of Sp1 and survivin after the various treatments.<br><br> The data collected suggests that nanoparticles alone have no effect on cancer cells, and treatment is still effective in their presence. Adding nanoparticles to TA seems to enhance its effects. The overall combination could both effectively kill cancer cells and protect healthy cells.

THE EFFECTS OF PEPPER JUICE VS. VANCOMYCIN AND COLLOIDAL SILVER ON MRSA INHIBITION AND CELL DEGRADATION
Alex Keeler
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

Vancomycin, Colloidal Silver and the Pepper Juice tincture, made of ginger, garlic, hawthorn, hot onion, horseradish, extracted capsaicin, and used as a daily supplement, was examined as a potential bacterial inhibitor against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. The effect of all three substances on tissue cell degradation and bacterial inhibition was tested. The hypothesis was that Pepper Juice would be most effective against MRSA than conventional protocols.<br><br> Four tests were conducted. In test I, a mixture of each, Pepper juice/MRSA, Vancomycin/MRSA, Colloidal Silver/MRSA and a control were made and reacted for 24 hours. 1/1000th ml of each was streaked onto agar plates, producing 48 samples. Observations showed (scale of 0-10 ,10 –control), Pepper Juice -0, Vancomycin-7, Colloidal Silver-2.Test II, 4 serial dilutions ( 1:1 to 1:8) were prepared, 4 trials each, 3 plates per trial, 192 agar plates, incubated for 12 hours. Results showed Pepper Juice inhibited growth by 80%, Vancomycin by 30%, Colloidal Silver 0%. Test III, 8 chicken tissue pieces were injected with each of the substances. 200 total plates with reaction times of 0, 12, 24, and 36 hrs were incubated for 24 hours. Vancomycin and Pepper juice showed MRSA inhibition, but both had an overgrowth of environmental bacteria. Test IV, slides of chicken tissue from test III were produced to observe any effects on tissue cells.<br><br> In conclusion, Pepper Juice was proven to be more effective than the other substances it was compared to. Pepper juice showed the greatest effect on bacterial inhibition and minimal tissue degradation.

INHIBITION OF PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR-1: A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH FOR DIABETIC VASCULAR DISEASE
Samantha Renae Prabakaran
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

Diabetic patients have a high incidence of vascular disease leading to blindness, kidney failure and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial Progenitor Cells or EPCs are needed for vascular repair. EPC function is impaired in diabetes, due to elevated levels of Transforming Growth Factor - Beta 1 (TGF-B1) gene. Blocking TGF- B1 has been shown to improve EPC functions. TGF-B1 is present in many cell types and has a wide range of effects on cells. Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor – 1 (PAI-1), the principal downstream product of TGF-B1, is present in a limited number of cell types and has a narrower range of effects than TGF- B1 and therefore is targeted in this research. HYPOTHESIS: 1. TGF-B1 mediates its effects through PAI-1 2. Blocking PAI-1 would improve functions in diabetic EPCs. PROCEDURE: 1. EPCs are isolated from blood of diabetic patient and healthy controls. 2. TGF- B1 gene is blocked using Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (PMO), an agent that blocks gene transcription - and PAI-1 levels are measured. 3. PAI-1 is then blocked using RNA interference (gene silencing). 4. EPC functions of migration, proliferation and cell survival are measured. RESULTS: 1. Blocking TGF-B1 reduced PAI-1 levels in diabetic and non-diabetic EPCs. 2. PAI-1 blockade improved EPC functions. All results were statistically significant and supported both hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Results hold promising therapeutic strategy for vascular repair. 2. Methodology is novel in adopting gene silencing technology. 3. Technique provides potential for autologous cell replacement therapy - EPCs from a diabetic can be harvested, PAI-1 gene silenced ex-vivo and EPCs administered back into the same patient avoiding donor search and tissue rejection.

ANALYZING POLYGLUTAMINE TRACTS OF HUNTINGTON’S DISEASE FOR GENE EXPRESSION
Nikhil Sanon
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

Huntington’s Disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG (Cytosine Adenine Guanine) trinucleotide repeats. Expanded CAG repeats are translated into abnormally expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ) tracts, inducing the misfolding of disease causing protein. In this study, a PolyQ strand was found that expresses the human HTT gene similar to a non-disease length strand. These two strands that are common and unique to HD will be used in an RNA-Seq experiment that characterizes the transcriptome of HD. For the PolyQ experiment, the central dogma of DNA is to be completely reverted. Four polyglutamine stretches from Drosophila melanogaster flies expressing human HTT transgene were obtained. These stretches, varying in length, are Q20, Q50, Q103 weak, and Q103 respectively. The RNA extracted from the Drosophila flies was reverse transcribed. Thus, the RNA is converted into complementary DNA (cDNA). Next, a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the cDNA. The cDNA was then run in an electrophoresis gel so it could be examined under Ultra-Violet light to show the different bands’ size. After analyzing the bands, polyQ103weak was found to be the PolyQ strand most similar to the Q20 strand. With this data, the RNA-Seq project may commence and will characterize the transcriptome of HD.

PHARMOLOGICAL AND GENE THERAPY TREATMENTS FOR POMPE DISEASE
Rohini Singh

Pompe Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (GSDII)) is a metabolic disorder that is caused by the absence of the GAA gene and results in lysosomal glycogen build up in the tissue and muscles. Two different treatment methods, Myozyme and gene therapy, were used to treat infected cells from a Pompe mouse. Since Myozyme, the current treatment used for Pompe Disease, requires multiple infusions and still has limitations, it was hypothesized that gene therapy would be more effective in treating the disease using only one treatment. The results show that treating Pompe cells with GAA can restore enzyme activity. These results suggest that gene therapy for Pompe Disease may be a promising therapeutic strategy.

ISOLATING CANDIDATE GENES AFFECTING DIABETES USING A MOUSE MODEL DATA SET
Lauren Nicole Reagin
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

There are over 220 million diabetics worldwide (WHO, 2011). Previous studies have shown a genetic link to this devastating disease. This experiment aims to identify particular genes that affect the phenotypes of diabetes. The phenotypic effects of diabetes include leptin resistance, insulin resistance, and high glucose levels. Obesity and diabetes are often correlated with each other, so body weight may be a factor as well. <br><br>For this study, data from an inbred backcross mouse model was used. Specifically, the NZO x NON (Non-obese/Non-diabetic mouse crossed with a New Zealand obese mouse) dataset was analyzed. The data was analyzed with R/QTL to find chromosomal regions where candidate genes that might correlate to the phenotypes of type 2 diabetes may be found. A modified master R-script was coded and used to compare genotypes to phenotypic data. Mainscan plots were used to identify peaks. Leptin resistance showed genotypic significance on chromosomes 5, 12, and 15. High glucose levels showed significance on chromosomes 1 and 15. High body weight was significant for chromosomes 1, 12, and 15. <br><br>As chromosome 15 had significant peaks for all traits, it is now the focus of ongoing analysis. It is hypothesized that there will be a correlation between a gene/genes within 10 to 45 centiMorgans (cM) on chromosome 15 that have an effect on the phenotypic expression/susceptibility of diabetes. Data is currently being analyzed using EMMA and R/QTL to narrow candidate genes in this region. This gene list will be compared to the Mouse Genome Informatics Database.

CNS BINDING HUMAN MONOCLONAL AUTOANTIBODIES DO NOT EXACERBATE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS IN A MOUSE MODEL OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Spencer Kelly Gladis
Chatfield High School, Chatfield, MN

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MS is characterized by the degradation of the myelin sheath, a layer of fatty membranes that protects and insulates axons. Human monoclonal autoantibodies may have therapeutic utility in MS patients. Because of the nature of autoreactive antibodies it is first necessary to prove that they do not exacerbate clinical symptoms or pathological effects when used as a treatment. In this experiment, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In two separate studies, mice were treated at two different time points in the course of the disease. The clinical effects of the disease were noted daily in a blinded fashion. Through experimentation, it can be concluded that the human monoclonal autoantibodies do not exacerbate clinical symptoms or pathological effects in the EAE model of multiple sclerosis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these antibodies will not be toxic in patients with multiple sclerosis.

INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM AND PROSTATE CANCER
Dalia Martinez-Marin
Lubbock High School, Lubbock, TX

Prostate cancer is a significant health problem and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. The intracellular mechanisms underlying cancer are unclear. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]in) is an important second messenger that is crucial for the regulation of many cellular functions. We hypothesize that increased [Ca2+]in dynamics are associated with the transition from a lowly to a highly metastatic prostate cancer cell. As an experimental model we used lowly (LNCaP) and highly (CL1) metastatic human prostate cancer cells. We monitored [Ca2+]in dynamics—using a florescence probe (Fura-2) –by stimulating the cells with ATP. We determined that ATP stimulation elicits intrinsic transient [Ca2+]in increases that are significantly larger in CL1 than in LNCaP cells. The [Ca2+]in increase is mediated via Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE). We used thapsigargin (TG), to block the entry of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum, thus depleting the [Ca2+]in store and revealing SOCE. Then, we stimulated the cells with the addition of extracellular Ca2+ that activates SOCE. We found larger increase in [Ca2+]in in CL1 than in LNCaP. These results suggest that inhibition of the [Ca2+]in increase in metastatic cells, has the potential to decrease their malignancy.

COMPARISON OF MEN´S SPERM QUALITY
Tereza Agata Vesela
Gymnazium, Brno-Reckovice, Terezy Novakove 2, Brno-Reckovice, CZECH REPUBLIC

The project is focused on sperm quality problematics. I was interested in the way the sperm quality is influenced by age, environment in which we live and work, whether there is a substantial difference among various occupations and if the sperm is influenced by radiation, long-term use of medication of a certain type, drugs, smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercises and others.<br><br>To analyze this, I used the results of examination already taken and results, which I myself examined under the supervision of laboratory worker [100 samples]. There are results of tests of the assisted reproduction center clients contained in the data file but there are also results of healthy men – for example sperm donors. There were following parameters of ejaculate compared: volume, sperm concentration, share of progressively motile sperm, share of immotile sperm and also morphology. The analyses are verified by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric statistic test. <br><br>All of the selected criterions substantially influence the sperm analysis parameters. The quality of ejaculate decreases the most with age, the place of residence influences the quality the least. Regions with the best results are high laid and with no industry. Sedentary and psychologically demanding occupations are the worst when considering the sperm quality. Smokers have statistically less of volume then non-smokers. Professional drivers have problems with sperm morphology - they have round-headed sperms. This can be a result of sitting for a long time, because there is a higher temperature in their testicles. And men with biologically their own child (children) have better share of progressively motile sperm.

DIFFERENTIAL INTERACTION OF FILAMINA, RACK1, AND CFTR IN CFTR- AND DELTAF-CFTR EXPRESSING CELL LINES
Margaret Harris Heard Landefeld
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that causes mucus to thicken, leading to severe lung and digestive problems. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a protein made from the CFTR gene. A mutation of the 508th amino acid of the CFTR protein makes the protein to fold abnormally, causing cystic fibrosis. FilaminA and RACK1 stabilize CFTR; without them, CFTR could not regulate ion channels in the cell, contributing to mucus buildup. The purpose of the project was to test cystic fibrosis bronchiole epithelial (CFBE41) cell lines for interaction between the proteins CFTR, RACK1, and FilaminA. Co-immunoprecipitations were done on total cell lysates of BHK cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR and ∆F508-CFTR. The co-immunoprecipitations of the CFBE41 cells were prepared with total cell lysates of cells expressing empty vector, wild type, and deltaF508. Western Blots were used to detect FilaminA, RACK1, and CFTR protein levels. Additional co-immunoprecipitations were done with forskolin treatment at 37°C and 26°C for CFBE41 cells. Each experiment tested deltaF cells, which contained the mutation for cystic fibrosis, wild type cells, and empty vector cells. The CFBE41 cells showed some interaction of RACK with CFTR and FilaminA and can be used to further study cystic fibrosis.

TESTING THE TOXICITY OF AH3 [VO(SAL-L-TRYP) (N-ETHHYMETHOHCARBTHIO)] ON DROSOPHILA MELANGASTER
Melinda Kari Solomon
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS

The purpose of this experiment is to test the toxicity of a potentially photodynamic drug, AH3, on fruit flies. There have been no reports about the effects of light on the cytotoxicity of vanadium(IV) complexes; therefore, these behavioral assays will prove if vanadium is worth studying. The two behavioral assays performed on the fruit flies were geotaxis and locomotor, both of these assays will give an approximation of the drug's toxicity. The flies were feed the AH3 for 4 days and were kept in constant conditions of a 12 hour light/dark cycle, 25°C, and 60% humidity. The two fly types used were Oregon-R and a defected fly line; the defected fly line has a gene deficiency which caused them to have little or no movement. The defected fly line was a side project because the AH3 was apperaring to show little toxicity on the Oregon-R and was reversing the DMSO muscle relaxation defects, so the researcher wanted to see if the AH3 could reverse a preexisting muscle relaxation defect. In conclusion, it appears AH3 could potentially make an ideal therapeutic drug because it showed little toxicity on the fruit flies.

CHEMICAL STERILIZATION OF MEDICAL CATHETERS USING AN AUTOCLAVE WITH A HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SOLUTION, YEAR SEVEN OF AN ONGOING STUDY
Aubrey Ward Craig II
The Collegiate High School at Northwest Florida State College, Niceville, FL

Is using Hydrogen Peroxide in an autoclave effective in sterilizing medical catheters? Will it neurtalize all bacterial cultures? Will a higher concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide be more effective than a lower one? Will a longer period of time be more effective than a shorter one? The purpose of my project is to study the effects Hydrogen Peroxide used in autoclaves has on the sterilization of medical equipment. It was hypothesized that Hydrogen Peroxide would be an effective sterilization agent, and would be more effective at a higher concentration for a longer time. <br><br>A breif procedure is as follows. Medical catheters [Urinary and Blunt needles] were incubated in test tubes containing Staphylococcus Areus. The autoclave is filled with 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, the catheters are transferred to sterile test tubes and placed into the autoclave which was then ran for the set time, after cooling the catheters were removed and placed on Petri dishes. After 24 hours these cultures were evaluated and the results were recorded.<br><br>The results showed that two of the hypotheses were accepted and one was invalid. After completeing the tests with 3% Hydrogen Peroxide it was found that due to effectiveness a higher concentration was not needed. All of the bacteria was sterilizied in all of the trials [2,5, and 10 minutes]. The results showed that Hydrogen Peroxide was very effective in sterilizing medical catheters.

THE MUSIC OF THE HEART: THE TRANSFORMATION OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) INTO SOUND
Heming Zhao
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Pulaski, VA

The electrocardiogram (ECG), a graphic depiction of heart’s electrical activity, is widely used by medical practitioners to diagnose abnormalities and possible heart attacks of patients. Wide spread use of ECG for critical situations gives reason to introduce innovative ideas into the ECG. The use of additional methods to output information from the ECG will efficiently enable medical professionals to differentiate high risk situations of the heart, primarily through sound. Mathematical models have been developed that simulated the transformation of ECG signals into sound, which confirmed that the critical ECG could be recognized by its transformed sound. An ECG prototype that collects and then processes real-time data was developed. First, an electrocardiogram circuit was built to produce ECG signals. Data was then input into an Arduino microcontroller where the signals were processed by a fast Fourier transform. Next, the output of Arduino was modulated and output through a speaker. The study established a prototype for future application of sound modulated ECG that can be used in various practical settings. The key benefit to this research was to develop a new method to provide medical staff with an additional and more convenient way to catch critical changes in the patient’s status.

THE EFFECTS OF ZINC GLUCONATE AND TWO OTHER DIVALENT CATIONIC COMPOUNDS ON OLFACTORY FUNCTION
Christopher Anthony Duncan-Lewis
Winter Springs High School, Winter Springs, FL

The intranasal application of zinc gluconate has been commonly used to treat common cold. The safety of this treatment, however, has recently come into question. In addition to a U.S. recall of a homeopathic product that contains zinc gluconate, there is abundant literature reporting the cytotoxic effects of zinc on the olfactory epithelium. There is also research suggesting that divalent cations (such as zinc) can block ion channels that facilitate the transduction of odors into electrical signals on the olfactory epithelium. The purpose this study was twofold: to confirm whether or not zinc gluconate causes anosmia and to reveal if any other divalent cationic compounds produce a similar effect. Groups of mice underwent a buried food pellet test to gauge olfactory function, and were then nasally irrigated with one of three divalent cationic compounds. When tested post-treatment, mice irrigated with zinc gluconate and copper gluconate experienced a marked increase in food-finding time, indicating that they had lost their ability to smell a hidden food source. Control mice irrigated with saline had a significantly lower increase in times. These results confirm that zinc gluconate can cause anosmia, and reveal that more than one divalent cation can negatively impact olfaction.

SEEKING CURES: AN EVALUATION OF THE TOXICITY OF MAP KINASE INHIBITOR U0126 IN AN ANIMAL MODEL
Alexander Zhang
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

U0126 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor that has exhibited the ability to inhibit seasonal and “swine” influenza virus replication in cell culture. U0126 does not directly target viral genes; therefore, drug-resistant virus mutations do not result. The purpose of this project is to assess the potential for drug development by testing the in vivo toxicity of U0126 on Daphnia magna and estimating the median lethal concentration (LC50). Two experiments were performed to define the optimal range and LC50. Daphnia neonates were incubated with various concentrations (0, 10, 100, and 1,000µM for rangefinding test and 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80µM for definitive test) of U0126 for 24 hrs and the numbers of Daphnia alive were recorded. Each experiment was repeated 3 times. From this data, the LC50 was estimated by Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method and graphical interpolation. In the definitive test, the D. magna mortality rate for U0126 was 91.67% at 80µM, 62.5% at 60µM, 20.83% at 40µM, 8.33% at 20µM, and 0% at 10µM and 0µM. The average LC50 estimated was about 52.5µM. Based on these results, U0126 has potential to pioneer a novel class of antiflu drugs that do not create drug-resistant mutants. Therefore, it should be tested on mammals to further drug development and mitigation of influenza pandemics.

IMPROVED ROOT CANAL THERAPY: THE EFFECT OF BIOACTIVE GLASS AND CHLORHEXIDINE WHEN COMBINED
Sara Jean Hays
Sunset High School, Portland, OR

Each year thousands of root canal therapies across the world fail, sometimes even multiple times, due to bacterial infection. The main bacteria inhabiting the sites of root canals is known as Enterococcus faecalis, an oral microbe known for its abilities to hide in the tubules of the tooth, proliferate rapidly, and resist elimination even while under starvation. Current endodontic therapies are successful in initially fighting this bacteria but it almost always returns after treatment as it hides in the tubules where many antibacterials aren’t able to reach. As a solution to this, a new endodontic medicament material was tested in this project: bioactive glass soaked in Chlorhexidine. Bioactive glass (BAG), a synthetic metal oxide material and lesser-used antimicrobial, may bind and slowly release Chlorhexidine (CHX), a strong antimicrobial currently used in endodontic procedures. Many current therapies only use one strong antimicrobial but if these two were combined to form a new endodontic medicament they may create a synergistic antibacterial effect capable of continuously killing bacteria. As BAG is made up of ions, it will also chemically strengthen the tooth while remaining inside. To test this theory I first found the minimum concentrations of Chlorhexidine and BAG required to individually kill E. faecalis. My next step was to soak the BAG in lower concentrations of Chlorhexidine rinses to compare their effectiveness when adsorbed onto BAG. Although I have not come to a definitive conclusion yet, once this knowledge is fully gained it could possibly change the success rates of root canal therapies and the overall health of the affected teeth.

NANOLIPOSOMAL DELIVERY FOR SMALL INTERFERING RNA IN MELANOMA
Felix Duc Huy Nguyen
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

Malignant melanoma is deadly if not detected early and is resistant to treatments. My previous project showed that a new strategy targeting DNA damage checkpoint Wee1 and cell survival pathway Akt3 using siRNA effectively sensitized the melanoma to chemotherapy induced cell death in cell cultures and engineered human skins. However, siRNAs are ineffective for clinical use unless they can reach the tumor cytoplasm. This study examines a novel nanoliposome containing Ceramide-PEG for siRNA delivery to induce effective melanoma cell death. Cationic liposomes were prepared by the thin film hydration method and sized by extrusion through 100nm polycarbonate membrane. Size and charge were measured by a nanosizer. The nanoliposomal siRNA cellular uptake and loading time were tested using fluorescent siRNA. The liposomal cytotoxicity was conducted in UACC903 GFP cell line using MTS viability assay, and a non-toxic concentration was determined at 25µM. The negative control siScramble remained unchanged from 50-200nM. V600E B-Raf was used as the positive control. Silencing Wee1 and Akt3 resulted in 65% and 70% decrease in viability, respectively, in 4 days after transfection. The gene silencing effect was confirmed by Western blotting. The liposomes have been PEGylated to reduce cationic charge and particle aggregation and maintain a desirable liposome size range at 100-200nm. Thus, minimal liposomal toxicity and optimal gene silencing can be achieved by the liposome formulation used in this study. In conclusion, this liposome formulation achieves good transfection efficiency and successful gene silencing, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Ceramide-PEG reduces the toxicity of cationic liposomes and enhances their cellular uptake by endocytosis and cytosolic release of siRNAs.

EFFICACY OF ER-BETA AGONISTS ON THE GROWTH OF LUNG CANCER CELLS
Jayme Paige Smith
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, killing millions annually. Since aromatase plays a significant role in the development of lung cancer, the effect of an aromatase inhibitor (Letrozole) on lung cancer cells (cell line A549) was tested. Prior to experimentation, the role of tumor estrogen receptors (ERs) in lung cancer was inconclusive. (According to recent published research, ERs are an integral component of breast cancer. Specifically, an overabundance of ER-alpha within breast cancer cells signals a negative prognosis, while high expression of ER-beta blocks the negative effects of ER-alpha.) The possibility that botanical agents containing ER-beta-selective estrogens can treat lung cancer was explored. The beneficial effects of natural ER-beta agonists, such as Liquiritigenin, Nyasol and MF101, a synthetic ER-beta agonist (DPN), and Letrozole on A549 lung cancer cells was tested. It was hypothesized that the natural ER-beta agonists (Nyasol, Liquiritigenin, and MF101) would have a greater effect upon the A549 cells’ proliferation, migration, colony formation, and ER-beta expression than the DPN or Letrozole alone. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that combination of ER-beta agonists and Letrozole would have synergistic effects upon the cells. Cell proliferation assays, migration assays, colony formation assays, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and DAPI were conducted. Research proved that the A549 cells were affected in a dose-dependent manner. The tests found that NYA and LIQ were most successful in the treatment of lung cancer. In conclusion, the data suggested that plant-derived ER-beta modulators effectively treat lung cancer and may be a potent therapeutic tool.

CAN BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG HELP PREVENT RESISTANT BREAST CANCER
Seshidar Rao Tekmal
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of the death in women. Breast cancer patients are treated hormone agents based on the initial properties of the tumor. Tamoxifen is commonly used for treating breast cancer and it is targeted to estrogen receptors (ER) present on tumor cells. Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor which blocks the estrogen production is also used for treating breast cancers. Some tumors stop responding to treatments as a result of developing resistance to these agents due to change in the regulation of epigenetic genes that are regulated by ER and its co-activator-mediated actions. The purpose of this study was to test whether Pargyline, a blood pressure drug, can sensitize resistant breast cancer cells and reduce tumor cell growth. If the hypotheses is right it is expected that Pargyline will sensitize resistant breast cancer cells are that resistant to Tamoxifen and lower or possibly stop the tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo conditions by affecting genes involved in epigenetic changes. The experimental approach include: treating breast cancer cells with Pargyline and measuring the growth of these cells using in vitro and animal model; examining effect of Pargyline on epigenetic and apoptotic changes using immunohistochemical methods and confirmation of the specificity of the epigenetic changes using siRNA approach. From this study, it was noticed that Pargyline reduced the growth of breast cancer cells in culture and restored sensitivity to treatment agents and as well as reduced growth of breast cancer tumors by affecting genes involved epigenetic and apoptotic changes. This study concludes that Pargyline may be useful to restore sensitivity to hormone therapeutic agents that are used for treating breast cancer.

CTLA4 LEVELS IN T-CELLS OF CELIAC DISEASE PATIENTS
Mary Olivia Richardson
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Celiac disease is known to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten; however, the exact pathogenesis is unclear. CTLA4, an immune-regulatory protein, has been associated with celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions. Lower levels of CTLA4 have been identified in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, and polymorphisms of the gene have been linked to susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. Altered expression of CTLA4 in celiac disease patients, as compared to controls, could indicate an important role for the gene in the onset of autoimmunity. This may be beneficial to diagnosis or possibly treatment of sprue and other autoimmune conditions. De-identified tissue samples from duodenal biopsies were stained using the immunoperoxidase technique to detect cells expressing CTLA4 and separately stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The CTLA4-stained slide for each case was examined under a light microscope and mononuclear cells in the lamina propria were counted. The H&E slide for each case was then examined for diagnosis. The ratio of CTLA4-stained cells to unstained cells and the percent CTLA4 composition were significantly greater in celiac patients than in normal (p values 0.007 and 0.008). This indicates ineffective regulation of the immune system, which may impact the understanding of the autoimmune process.

DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF-1) SIGNALING CASCADE AND THAT OF THE CLASSICAL INSULIN RECEPTOR (IR) IN THE MOUSE KIDNEY
Tiana Melvina Woods
North Point High School for Science, Technology and Industry, Waldorf, MD

By determining whether or not IGF-1 receptor expression and activity are upregulated in KO mice through the process of western blotting and mRNA, the relationship between IGF-1 signaling cascade and IR in the mouse kidney using IRKO or “knockout” mice (lack renal insulin receptors) will be determined. The mice used in the experiment survive and grow normally but they have significantly higher basal blood pressure. Performing western blots allows the detection of IGF-1 in the IRKO mice. If the blots show a significant amount of IGF, IGF-1 receptor expression and activity are upregulated in IRKO mice. Thus, this proves that the IGF-1 and IR have similar roles in the kidney because the IGF-1 is able to substitute successfully (also referred to as "upregulate") for the IR.

FABRIC TO HEALTH TREATMENTS IMPREGNATED OF ZIRCONIUM OXIDE AND SILVER NANOPARTICLES WITH CHITOSAN II
Kawoana Trautman Vianna
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Veira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

In the last year, I produced a dressing with the rayon fabric impregnated with zirconium oxide and silver nanoparticles, to postoperative care of amputations. It is known that there are at least 220 million diabetics worldwide and some estimative affirm that 15% of all of them will develop ulcers on their feet throughout their lives, which may lead to feet amputation. The impact of these amputations in the society and economy inspired me to produce, in this year, a fabric to manufacture socks to treat diabetic foot’s problems, avoiding amputations. I used the nanotechnology to develop a cloth able to activate blood flow and avoid cutaneous infections. In order to give to fabric these properties, I impregnated the studied nanoparticles in other fabric (cotton) and I added a new substance: chitosan. Once I produced the socks, I made new analysis. Analyzing the thermal insulator effect of these socks, according to ISO 9920, I saw that my fabric keeps the skin 0.5ºC warmer than the regular ones, which is enough to increase cutaneous blood flow. I tested its antimicrobial effect against the proliferation of several bacteria and fungus and I noticed that it inhibits microbial proliferation of all these migroorganisms, which is important to avoid infections. I also tested the irritation potential of the nanoparticles and did not notice any irritant effects. Moreover, the fabric showed wash resistance and lower cost than other antimicrobial socks. My research enabled the creation of a fabric that joins two important properties that, until now, are not simultaneously found in any product. Finally, based on my results, I concluded that the use of socks, manufactured with this innovative fabric is a convenient, efficient and accessible method to treat diabetic’s foot problems, reducing the chances of amputations.

The replicated experiment was to make chemical peptide synthesis of liraglutide and observe liraglutides effect on the appetite. Liraglutide is based on a human endogenous hormone called glucagons like peptide 1 (GLP-1). I performed a solid-phase synthesis on a synthesis machine. The synthesis always begins from the C-terminal and goes towards N-terminal. <br><br>After the peptide synthesis, the new drug is to be tested. The first test system is an in vitro system. This means that the substance tested in a cell culture environment. You use cell membranes from a cell line that expressed many GLP-1 receptors. Because liraglutide is a GLP-1 analogue, it is supposed to react with the GLP-1 receptor. <br><br>The test system I have used is called a Scittilations proximity assay (SPA). In this system, receptor complexes are bound to a radioactive ligand, which will be the extent of a SPA bead. This SPA bead will emit light when exposed to radioactivity. <br><br>After the in vitro test has shown that liraglutide binds to the GLP-1 receptor with the same potency as native GLP-1 itself, the effect of liraglutide will be tested in an in vivo system. This experiment was to investigated whether a single dose of liraglutide had an effect on the appetite.<br><br>I have with my experiments provided some evidence that the drug Victoza perhaps also could be used as a drug against obesity, which could thereby possibly be a medical help to find a way out of the growing obesity epidemic.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND FEMALE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURIES
Alexis Rae Shinn
Merino High School, Merino, CO

The purpose of this project was to identify the correlation between the menstrual cycle and female Anterior Cruciate Ligament injuries. The purpose was to also find if hormone changes (with the use of birth control pills) would prevent injuries during certain times of the menstrual cycle. The researcher acquired subjects from a physical therapy clinic and a surgeon’s clinic to fill out surveys that were created by the researcher. The surveys were accompanied by a letter and an informed consent. The researcher then harvested ligaments and tendons from porcine and bovine to expose to hormones. The data showed that the most tears occurred during menstruation, the next highest was during ovulation, and tears during the luteal phase and follicular phase tied. The data also showed that more patients who sustained injuries were not on birth control, showing that birth control could prevent injuries. With 27 ACL tears, 13 were during menstruation, 3 during ovulation, 3 during the luteal phase, 4 during the follicular phase, and 4 did not remember. With 2 partial ACL tears, 1 was during menstruation and 1 did not remember. With a total of 49 different tears, 22 were during menstruation, 8 during ovulation, 6 during the luteal phase, 6 during the follicular phase, and 7 did not remember. Out of 27 ACL tears, 6 patients were using birth control while 21 were not. Out of 2 partial ACL tears, 1 was using birth control while 1 was not. The ligament stretching test showed the ligaments were less lax during week 3 and without birth control.

HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIC AND HYPOGLYCEMIC EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS: NATURAL REMEDIES FOR OBESITY AND DIABETES
Renuka Ramchandran
John A. Ferguson Senior High School, Miami, FL

Obesity is a growing concern worldwide that has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Obesity rate in the United States is among the highest in the world with 74.1 % of the adults being overweight or obese as of 2007. It is a risk factor for many of the major chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer that are grouped together as metabolic syndrome. Although several pharmaceutical drugs are available for treating hypercholesterolemia (increased levels of bad cholesterol) and hyperglycemia (increased level of blood glucose), very often these drugs have major side-effects. It is believed that several natural products and nutraceuticals have hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic effects with very little side-effects; although these properties have not been scientifically established very well. In the present study, both hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic properties of supercritical extracts from natural herbs that have been often mentioned to possess such properties were investigated in HepG2 liver cell line and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Supercritical extracts of rosemary, mangosteen, and oregano inhibited LDL cholesterol (bad) synthesis, and rosemary especially increased HDL cholesterol (good) level. These natural products also inhibited the HMG-CoA reductase activity. Rosemary extract in particular inhibited the adipocyte differentiation by 40% and increased cellular uptake of glucose by 160%, which was followed by oregano extract. Rosemary and mangosteen extracts also have significant inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase activity. These results suggest that rosemary, oregano, and mangosteen supercritical extracts are good for controlling obesity, heart diseases, and diabetes and should be included in the diet.

ANTI-CANCER PROPERTIES OF FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES DERIVED FROM CLERMONTIA PARVIFLORA, A NATIVE HAWAIIAN PLANT
Shalila Shek de Bourmont
Hilo High School, Hilo, HI

Twelve species of endophytic fungi that grow within the tissues of Clermontia parviflora, a rare native Hawaiian plant, were isolated from leaf samples. Five of these were tested for their ability to fight cancer. After the fungus species were isolated and grown, their chemicals were extracted using organic solvents, and cytoxicity assays were performed against LU1 (mammalian lung) cancer cells. Of these, two showed anti-cancer activity (samples M10 and M2). The best results were found for M10, for which average LU1 cancer cell survival rates at 40 and 20 mcg/ml were 35% and 64% respectively indicating a strong dosage response. An additional dosage response evaluation found that M10 and M2 had ED50 values of approximately 10 mcg/ml and 40 mcg/ml respectively. Compounds with an ED50 value less than 20 mcg/ml are officially declared active, strongly suggesting that M10 is an active anti-cancer compound. Further studies are needed to fully understand our preliminary results.

MONOCYTIC GENE CELL THERAPY: POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Jasmine Samaiya Roberts
Paul R. Wharton High School, Tampa, FL

Introduction: This research investigates if amyloid-Beta (AB) plaque, which causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD), can be reduced when cultured cells are injected into Alzheimer’s Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) transgenic mice. The purpose of this research is to determine if CD11b+ monocytes cells cultured with cytokines (TNF and IL4) can be used as a treatment to effectively reduce Alzheimer’s AB plaque pathology. These cultured cells induce (increase) the production of proteases enzymes, neprilysin and insulysin, which reduce AB plaque. In the US, over 5 million Americans suffer with AD. The significance of developing a new treatment for AD will save taxpayers millions of dollars in healthcare costs, improve the quality of life for Alzheimer’s victims, and increase the survival rate of individuals. <br><br>Method: This research utilized the brain tissue of 3 groups of mice: Interleukin-4 (IL4), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF), and control. This investigation consists of making 100+ slides with brain tissue on them. Also, the research conducted Western Blots, processed bone marrow, cultured CD11b+ monocytes with cytokines and control, harvested cells, implanted the cells into the brain, sectioned the brain, stained (AB immuno and Congo Red stains) and mounted of the brain sections, dehydrated the tissue, imaged, and image analysis (ANOVA and T-Test). <br><br>Conclusion: The results of this research supported the researcher’s hypothesis and revealed that when Alzheimer’s APP mice were implanted with CD11b+ monocytes cells cultured with cytokines (TNF and IL4), there was a significantly decreasing trend in AB plaque in the brain. This means these cytokines can lower the AB plaque and possibly improve memory loss when injected as a therapeutic cell treatment.

DETERMINING THE CALORIC AND ENERGY CONTENTS OF NUTS
Jessica Hsieh Li
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

This experiment is about finding the energy in different nuts through a calorimeter and then measuring which nuts released the most heat and food calories/food energy. To find the energy I built a homemade calorimeter and burned 5 different kinds of nuts. Before burning I measured the temperature change of the water by using a Celsius thermometer and calculated the amount of energy in calories used to raise the temperature of the water. This was done by multiplying the temperature difference by the mass of the water and the specific heat factor for water.<br><br>To my study I have found that almost all of the nuts that I tested had high burning temperatures. The almond had the most energy and provided the most calories per gram. The results prove that calories directly relate to the amount of energy put off by the nut, and show that the most effective.<br><br>The applications of nuts to one's health and to bio-technology are very interesting. Nuts are a compact source of calories that also have health benefits to help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and help fight heart disease and cancer. A very exciting area where nuts highly compact caloric content can be used is in the area of alternative fuels. The oils from the nuts could be extracted and used as an automotive fuel alternative.

Each data set was checked for errors. Fsl Feat Directories were accessed and the number of inputs was changed to ten. Mixed effects group average was applied to all ten data sets, and the results were subjected to a Z-statistic threshold of 2.3. The clustering method was applied to account for family wise error rates. The significance was estimated using the Gaussian Random Field Theory, and where clusters with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant. Imaged areas were then viewed and calculated for percent of deactivation in the brain relative to the areas that were hypothesized. Standard deviation and median were calculated and appropriate graphs were produced using Excel 2007.<br><br>The results illustrated high concordance, correlating to the hypothesis. All seven hypothesized areas demonstrated relative deactivation. They were activated before the task was initiated, but deactivated during the conjunctive visual search task when they were not in use. As a result, this experiment has developed an enhanced understanding of the manner in which the intricate brain functions.

SIMULATION OF ACTION POTENTIAL OF A CARDIAC MYOCYTE AND STUDY OF ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC DRUGS
Shreyans Kirit Patel
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, FL

Arrhythmia is the term used to describe any condition where there is abnormal electrical activity in the heart. Some types of arrhythmias are life-threatening medical conditions that can result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. The most common noninvasive test used to diagnose arrhythmic conditions is the surface electrocardiogram because of its ability to detect action potentials produced by the cardiac myocytes. When these tests show abnormal heart function, anti-arrhythmic drugs are used to restore normal condition. This project will explore how the effects of these drugs can be simulated. <br><br>This project involves the simulation of the action potentials through MATLAB using the Luo Rudy model. This model details the electrical activity of various ion channels in a cardiac myocyte. A series of programs are created so that an action potential can be generated that is parameter dependent. Normal values for the equilibrium potential, ion concentration, and channel conductance are inputted and the normal action potential is graphed. Then the action potentials of increased and decreased permeability of various channels are examined. The different classes of the drug showed various changes in the cardiac action potential. <br><br>Such a simulation can be used by physicians to model a patient’s action potential from a surface electrocardiogram and get a better understanding of how each drug will affect the heart function of the patient.

THE PROGRAMMING OF AND THE APPLICATION OF AUTOMATED DIGITAL MICROSCOPY IN ANALYZING LUNG INFLAMMATION AND CELLULAR IMAGERY
Joseph Darius Soltzberg
Hawken School, Chesterland, OH

Various drugs are often tested via animal models, which are meant to mimic human diseases so that scientists can study new drugs and innovative medicines. In cystic fibrosis and asthma, the lung of a given animal is the primary region of study, as inflammation occurs primarily in the lung. Qualitative measures of inflammation cause much variability and difficulty in interpreting inflammation levels. The work done here focuses on the creation of a quantitative means to measure lung infection and inflammation using murine models of chronic asthma and cystic fibrosis. I have developed a highly precise and reproducible quantitative software program with Image Pro Microscopy to diagnose inflammation levels. The computer software operates by autonomously collecting data within given parameters on a tissue sample and identifying inflammatory cells. It then determines an inflammation level based on pixel and size values to the mean of 196 images of each lung section. The data shows a low coefficient of variance and high precision. The software also correlates very accurately to other known methods of measuring inflammation, such as manual point-counting. This software will enhance the quantitative ability by which to diagnose inflammation in murine models and test drugs meant to alleviate inflammation. This software also demonstrates much potential in being able to be expanded to a variety of animal models and a variety of cellular imagery, as oppose to just murine-modeled inflammation.

BRAIN PLASTICITY: THE EFFECT OF AGE (A TWO YEAR STUDY)
Olivia A. Dure
The Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

The objectives of this experiment were to find the difference of adaptation with age. Brain plasticity is the ability to adapt to learning new tasks. Studies on brain plasticity can aid research done on the development and the deterioration of the brain. This project is a two-year continuation study with 125 subjects. The objects of this experiment were to find if people of different ages adapted in different ways to a visual motor task. This year 75 participants were tested in the age groups 7-10, 21-40,41-63, and 65+. In the experiment subjects threw unmarked tennis balls 8 feet from a target twenty times (Test I). They then wore prism goggles, which had ∆25 prism lenses, and throw twenty more times (Test II). Then the subjects take off the goggles and throw twenty more times (Test III). The data was recorded, graphed, and statistically analyzed. The statistical results show that all the age groups can adapt, because Test I and Test II are not statistically different. The young children also differ statistically from other age groups in Test I and Test III, but in Test II they are not statistically different. This shows that there is a difference in the adaptation of different age groups. The young children differ from other age groups, and this supports the idea that there is a developmental change in the brain occurring between ten and fifteen. These results show that people of all ages continue to have the ability to adapt and that a developmental difference exists between the young children and any other age groups. These results reveal that brain plasticity varies with age.

DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL LISTERIA-CASPASE-3 DNA VACCINE TO ERADICATE METASTATIC BREAST CANCER
Swathi Krishnan
Rye Country Day School- Upper School, Rye, NY

One of the main problems in cancer vaccination is the strong suppression of vaccine-induced immune responses in tumor environments, especially in patients 65 years and older, due to T cell unresponsiveness. The goal of this study was to develop and test a potentially effective breast cancer vaccine to eradicate metastasis without inducing T cell responses. The developed vaccine is a combination of Caspase-3, an apoptotic enzyme, and the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes – an intracellular pathogen that can deliver vaccine antigens. Listeria-Caspase-3 kills tumor cells through different pathways: (1) tumor cell kill by Caspase-3 induced apoptosis, (2) tumor cell kill through Listeria-induced Reactive-Oxygen-Species, and (3) tumor cell kill by natural-killer cells. <br><br>Using a two-step procedure, wild-type Caspase-3 was cloned into the Listeria bacterium, and then tested for its infectivity, kill capabilities, and ability to induce apoptosis in MCF-7, a human breast cancer tumor cell-line. The kill experiments demonstrated that Listeria-Caspase-3 kills MCF-7 cells at a similar rate as Listeria alone, 97.2% and 97.9% respectively. The infection experiments, however, give evidence that Listeria-Caspase-3 infected 133% more MCF-7 cells than Listeria alone. The apoptosis assay, however, was inconclusive. Although initial testing shows promising results, further testing is needed to understand the capabilities of Listeria-Caspase-3.

DOWNSTREAM ASSAY FOR LASER CAPTURE MICRODISSECTION TO EXAMINE JC VIRUS TRAFFICKING INTO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
Paul Austin James Howell
Dominion High School, Sterling, VA

JC virus (JCV) is a common human polyomavirus activated under conditions of immunosupression established in the context of organ transplants or HIV/AIDS. JCV traffics to the central nervous system (CNS) where lytic infection of the target glial cell-type, oligodendrocytes, can result in the development of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalapathy (PML). Within the first six months of diagnosis, PML is typically fatal. Currently it is unclear as to how JCV enters the CNS. However, it is commonly believed peripheral cell types that become infected or harbor JCV, are responsible for trafficking JCV into the CNS. An immortalized human glial cell line, SVG, was developed for the study of JCV in vitro. The purpose of this study was to establish a downstream assay for Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM). LCM will be used to identify the individual cells and/or cell types infected with, or harboring, JCV within biopsy tissues of PML patients. Therefore, this study examined the rate and level of infection in SVG cultures exposed to various concentrations of JCV by ultra-sensitive Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) analysis. With the exception of the latest time point, higher levels of JCV exposure resulted in a higher cell-associated viral copy number. At the latest time point there was no significant difference in copy number generated between the highest and middle JCV exposures, suggesting that optimal viral infection occurs between these two concentrations. These results confirm this QPCR is appropriate for downstream analysis of LCM, which subsequently will aid in identifying infected cells in biopsy tissues.

THE INHIBITION OF TUMOR CELL GROWTH BY CORDYCEPIN
Jason Shao Cui
Langley High School, Mclean, VA

To combat cancer, most patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiation to reduce cancerous tumor cells. However, these methods involve destroying healthy cells and lead to harmful side effects. Many studies fail to find an alternative to these methods of cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate if Cordyceps sinensis, a species of endoparasitical fungi prominent in oriental medicine, has the ability to reduce cancerous cells while preventing healthy cell apoptosis. Cordycepin (3’-deoxyadenosine) in Cordyceps sinensis was found to prevent tumor cell proliferation. It was hypothesized that Cordycepin extracted from Cordyceps sinensis would inhibit the growth of cancer cells while leaving healthy human cells unharmed. First, HeLa cervical cancer cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were cultured in vitro separately in 200 µL of growth medium. Secondly, the cells were separated onto a 96 well microplate, 20 wells each allotted for both cells. Cordycepin diluted in water was then added in ten concentrations from 20 µg/mL down to 2 µg/mL to ten wells each of HeLa and PBMC cells, leaving the remaining cells to act as the negative control. Once MTT assay was added to the cells, they were suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for viewing at 490 nm in an automated spectrophotometer. The data collected showed the amount of cancer cells decreased with higher concentrations of Cordycepin, while the number of PBMC (healthy) cells remained constant throughout. The hypothesis was supported, and it was clear that Cordycepin was able to prevent tumor cell proliferation, along with leaving healthy cells unharmed.

EFFICACY OF VALPROIC ACID AS A GSK-ALPHA INHIBITOR IN TREATMENT OF AMYLOID-ALPHA AGGREGATION AND NEURONAL APOPTOSIS IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Shreyas Mahapatra
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid-alpha plaques around neurons and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of the protein Tau inside neurons. The aggregation of amyloid-alpha has been associated with the function of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3-alpha) protein kinase. Valproic acid has been used in the medical community as an antiepileptic drug for many years. At the same time, research has shown that valproic acid may act as a GSK-3-alpha inhibitor, reducing its function through phosphorylation. This study aimed to test the efficacy of valproic acid as an GSK-alpha inhibitor as well as determine the optimal, nontoxic dosage range. It also explored the possibility of valproic acid's role as a Histone H3 protein and transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) deactivator. <br><br>Analysis of cell viability before and after treatment with valproic acid was conducting using viability assays. Protein samples were collected from the valproic acid-treated BV2 cells. Protein immunoblotting confirmed valproic acid's effect as a GSK-3-alpha inhibitor. Valproic acid acted to reduce the function of GSK-3-alpha through phosphorylation. In addition decreased protein expression of acetylated histone H3, another protein kinase associated with memory dysfunction and STAT3, an transcription factor associated with amyloid-alpha-induced neuronal cell death, were decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that valproic acid may be an effective primary and peripheral treatment of amyloid-alpha plaque development in mice and human models.

SUBJUGATION OF P. AERUGINOSA’S OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENESIS THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF NOVEL ANTI-NEUTROPHIL THERAPY
Aditya Samir Mazmudar
Fairfax High School, Fairfax, VA

In light of the rising numbers of bacterial nosocomial infections and Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, this research identified the paradoxical role of lysed neutrophils, particularly in the Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET), in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. Furthermore, it exploited the NET transfer of granular proteins and DNA by targeting it with anionic amino acids, which via electrostatic competition and acid-base interaction dissociated positively-charged histones that link DNA/Actin bundles. The research successfully utilized glutamic and aspartic acid to inhibit and eradicate the augmentation of P. aeruginosa biofilms in pseudo-infection sites. <br><br>The McFarland standard was employed using a turbidity stabilizer to generate bacteria-neutrophil mixtures. P. aeruginosa was cultured in TS Agar plates with 5 % Sheep’s Blood using a modified version of the Kirby Bauer Method. Quantification occurred using dilution plus measurement of the zones of inhibition. Quantitative data was analyzed to determine the role of neutrophils, the trends in the application of glutamic and aspartic acid individually & synergistically and the virulence of the therapeutic dosages over time.<br><br>Fundamental trends illustrated the use of glutamic acid as a medium-effect long term treatment while that of aspartic acid as a large-effect short term treatment. Inferential statistical analysis and regression modeling were used to conclude trends and validate original hypotheses of the research. Essentially, this research study has provided a comprehensive drug therapy for antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa infections and created a medical model that can be replicated to bypass traditional antibiotic resistance in other bacterial pathogens as well.

THE EFFECT OF TAURINE ON CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION IN DAPHNIA MAGNA
Heba Khaled Rashed
South County Secondary School, Lorton, VA

This experiment assessed if taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid thought to be essential in several cellular mechanisms which serve to protect the heart in a variety of different pathological conditions, can improve cardiovascular dysfunction in Daphnia magna. In addition to a control group with pure spring water, the Daphnia were tested in three concentrations of acetylcholine with ten Daphnia in each concentration. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter which has been found to inhibit cardiac function in Daphnia. This first part of the experiment evaluated which concentration hinders but does not stop the Daphnia’s heart. A conforming concentration of 1.4 x 10-4 M was established upon five days of observation based on the Daphnia’s heart rate per minute which exhibited an average inhibition of 17%. In the second part of the experiment, Daphnia was placed in the established concentration to had their hearts weakened. Impaired Daphnia from the acetylcholine solution were then submerged in a taurine concentration of 5.52 x 10-3 M, an amount based on the recommended dosage that corresponds with the Daphnia’s body mass. After a period of five days, the Daphnia exhibited a 14% heart rate improvement. This is evidence that taurine indeed does play a role in the improvement of cardiovascular dysfunction. Seeing its success in doing so with Daphnia Magna, steps should be taken to initiate further study on the matter with progressively complex animals, potentially leading up to humans.

Coffea arabica is a species of Coffea originally indigenous to the mountains of Yemen, and also from the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and southeastern Sudan. Scientific studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and an array of medical conditions. In this project, the effect of the aqueous extract of Green Caffea arabica on blood clotting in man in vitro has been sudied.<br><br>Three different crudes extracts from the beans of Green Coffea Arabica using water, acetone or methanol as a solvent were prepared. The effect of these extracts on the blood coagulation was studied in vitro on human blood samples using Stago compact apparatus. <br><br>The results obtained in this study showed that the three extracts inhibited coagulation of the blood. The methanolic extract showed the highest anti-coagulation effect with ptt 86.2 against 33.1 for the normal control, while the ptt for the aqueous and acetone extracts were 31.9 and 36.8 respectively. Serial delution for the three extracts showed increased anticogualnt activity as the concentration of all extracts was increased. The extracted phenols from the three extracts showed a remarkable anticoagulant activity, therefore, anticoagulant agent in the three extracts seems to be phenolic in nature.Then and after GC & HPLC analysis , three different phenols are found in the three extracts of Green Coffea Arabica, Chlorogenic Acid, Caffeic Acid and Gallic Acid , therfore these phenols consider as anticoagulant<br><br> agents in this non chemical material((the green coffee beans)).

RT-PCR GENOTYPIC ANALYSIS OF FOUR MEX EFFLUX PUMPS IN PAN-RESISTANT PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL PHENOTYPIC DETECTION METHOD BY MIC WITH EPI
Kevin Z. Xin
Shanghai American School, Shanghai, CHINA

Equipped with multiple chromosomally encoded mechanisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can exhibit impressive resistance towards numerous antimicrobial agents. Emergence of Pan-resistant P. aeruginosa strains presents a formidable therapeutic challenge. The purpose of this investigation was to use quantitative SYBR Green RT-PCR to analyze the mRNA overexpression of the four most common Mex efflux pumps in Pan-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and to develop a novel practical methodology for detection of these four pumps through application of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) tests and Efflux Pumps Inhibitor (EPI) compound MC-207110. Forty-one Pan-resistant and thirty sensitive P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from Shanghai Huashan Hospital were included. RT-PCR results showed mRNA overexpression rates among Pan-resistant isolates containing one or multiple pumps were all significantly higher than those of sensitive isolates (p<0.01). No sensitive isolates contained 2 or more Mex pumps. Overexpression of any one of the Mex pumps would contribute significantly to Pan-resistance. A novel method for detecting these four pumps was developed and evaluated by results yielded by RT-PCR. Overexpression of MexAB-OprM, MexXY-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprM increased the MIC readings of piperacillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and imipenem, respectively. When P. aeruginosa is exposed to EPI, a greater than eight-fold MIC reading decrease corresponded to overexpression of a specific pump. The sensitivity and specificity of the novel method are 91.4% and 87.7%, respectively. Compared with RT-PCR, the novel MIC method is advantageous: accurate, time-efficient, and cost-efficient. Using this practical MIC method, medical staff can effectively determine the precise efflux pumps present and afterwards apply appropriate therapeutic treatments.

BIOMAGNETISM: FORCE OR FICTION?
Gregory Derrick Poore
Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether “biomagnetism” <br><br>is a legitimate balance enhancer or if it is all a placebo effect. This was tested in a statistical experiment where the balance and stability of the subjects were measured and means of the differences hypothesis tests were applied among no band, placebo band, and magnetic band. Cluster sampling was administered and all the subjects in the group were tested after getting a parent-waiver release form signed. For the experiment, subjects stood in a standardized position with their eyes closed to remove visual balance assist; it was a single-blind experiment. The balance times for each treatment and an opinion survey, “Which treatments were preferred the most?” were recorded. The data was used in confidence intervals, three t-tests, and two chi-squared tests to show significance. The tests yielded that the magnetic band was statistically significant in improving balance compared to no band and compared to a placebo band, thus suggesting that “biomagnetism” is a legitimate balance enhancer. The placebo data was not significant and the null hypothesis was not rejected compared to both no band and the magnetic band. The survey and chi-squared results showed that the subjects believed any band improved their balance though their times did not endorse that, showing the difference between psychological placebo effect and actual motor functions. From these results, the experimenter determined that magnetic bands, or “biomagnetism” in general, are significant in improving balance and that it is more than a placebo effect.

THE EFFECTS OF STATIC MAGNETIC FIELDS (SMFS) ON THE BIOMINERALIZATION OF OSTEOBLASTS
Hannah Ruihan Jin
West Windsor - Plainsboro High School South, Princeton Junction, NJ

Static magnetic fields (SMFs) have the potential to be applied therapeutically to accelerate or improve the healing of bone injuries. The purpose of our experiment is to document, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the effects of SMFs (flux density 150mT) on the proliferation, differentiation, and biomineralization of osteoblasts.<br><br>For each experiment, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured onto a substrate, usually silicon or glass with a sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) coating. At the appropriate time points, the cells were taken out and analyzed by one of several methods, including cell counting, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, bicinchoninic (BCA) acid assay, osteocalcin assay, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDAX). <br><br>The results of these experiments showed that SMFs promote the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts, as well as having a distinctive effect upon cell morphology. These conclusions suggest that SMFs may have a significantly positive effect upon the formation of new bone tissue, and could have therapeutic applications in the way of aiding with the healing of injured bone tissue.

ERYTHROCYTE DYSFUNCTION AND AMELIORATION IN HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC CONDITIONS
Siddhartha Gautama Jena
International Academy, Bloomfield Hills, MI

Increase in blood cholesterol is a major precursor to cardiovascular disease, which claims more than half a million lives in the United States. Our earlier studies demonstrate that one of the immediate effects of elevated plasma membrane cholesterol is the dysfunction of water and CO2 transport at the RBC membrane, and its amelioration by a PLA2 inhibitor. The water channel AQP1 at the RBC membrane is known to transport both water and gases. Since both the Gai protein stimulator mastoparan and PLA2 inhibitor stimulate AQP1, the interaction between these proteins at the RBC membrane was hypothesized and tested in the present study. Since potassium channels have been implicated in the regulation of AQP1, and the chloride channel on gas transport in the RBC, the effect of elevated plasma membrane cholesterol on their function was further hypothesized and investigated. Studies were performed on purified rat RBC, and the presence of AQP1 and its regulatory proteins was determined using Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays, and further confirmed using immunocytochemistry. Real-time changes in both the potency and efficacy of RBC water transport were determined using dynamic light scattering, and confirmed using light microscopy. CO2 entry into RBC in the presence of cholesterol was further determined. Results from the study identify the molecular players involved in RBC water and gas transport, demonstrating the immediate detriment of elevated plasma membrane cholesterol on the process, which is overcome by inhibiting PLA2. Survey reveals a PLA2 inhibitor currently in phase III human trial for treatment of atherosclerosis.

USING THE DEGREE OF END ORGAN DAMAGE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF HEART FAILURE PATIENTS AFTER MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DEVICE IMPLANTATION
Qiaoyi Li
Briarcliff High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

5 million Americans suffer from heart failure (HF), a complex syndrome which can lead to a progressive decline in the function of the body’s organ systems. Although heart transplantation is the ideal treatment, patients who are unable to receive a transplant receive a mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD). In this study, we hypothesized that degree of end organ damage (EOD) as measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) can predict the outcome of HF patients after MCSD implantation. We analyzed data from 176 patients and collected their respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation and renal system data to calculate SOFA scores one week prior to MCSD implantation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed to assess SOFA performance and and post-operative survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Our results showed a gradual increase in mortality rate with an increase in SOFA score. There was a 12.5% mortality rate with SOFA score <4, 76.4% with SOFA score 5-8, 95% with SOFA score 9-12, and 95% with SOFA score >13 (p= 0.000). Because degree of EOD was shown as a strong predictor of MCSD implantation outcomes, this approach can be useful in selecting patients and/or selecting appropriate times for surgery.

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION'S EFFECT ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Michael Christopher Guevara
Joseph W. Nixon High School, Laredo, TX

For the past years’ scientists have been puzzled with the question, is Electromagnetic Radiation a threat to your health. Over the past decade many extraordinary scientists have proven the theory to be more than accurate. Electromagnetic Radiation (also known as EMR) can be found in every single room of our homes from toasters, to refrigerators, ovens, TV’s, lamps, even to unused wires that are in the walls. A university in the pacific northwest conducted research on the effects of EMR on rat’s brains. The rats were exposed to microwave signals (major producer of EMR), in which they showed breaks in the DNA associated in the increase of free radicals and increased cell death. These cell deaths are at the same levels of exposure that a cell phone produces right next to a person’s head. The cells found in a rat’s brain are fairly similar to the brain cells of a human being. There is one question that constantly haunts my mind. Why haven’t we paid proper attention to this type of radiation that may in fact cause many forms of cancer? Therefore, I began conducting my experiment with Electromagnetic Radiation and Drosophila Melanogaster(more commonly known as the fruit fly). Although we are an entirely different species, what makes us think that we wont be harmed like the fruit fly when exposed to EMR for a long period of time? I applied EMR to the Drosophila Melanogaster over a period of time at the larva stage and at the full-grown stage. The changes which occurred are structural deformities such as extra limbs, deformed body parts, lack of energy and even death. My conclusions resulted with devastating results providing proof that in fact Electromagnetic Radiation is a hazard to our daily lives.

CHARACTERIZATION OF TYRPHOSTIN AG879 AS A NOVEL SELECTIVE MODULATOR OF AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN GAMMA-SECRETASE: TOWARDS SAFE NEUROPROTECTIVE THERAPY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Shaunak Krishan Bakshi
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

Alzheimer’s Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2009, approximately 5.3 million Americans suffer from the disease. Currently, there is no cure, and available treatments may at best temporarily alleviate symptoms. In this study, Tyrphostin AG879, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is identified and characterized as a novel Gamma-Secretase modulator and lead compound for Alzheimer’s Disease therapy. The Gamma-Secretase enzyme, which plays a key role in Amyloid Precursor Protein proteolysis, has been focused on as a therapeutic target. However, inhibitors of the protease have been reported to induce severe side effects and toxicity, through disruption of signaling of the Notch receptor, posing a major challenge in drug development. Thus, AG879 was analyzed with the aim of balancing efficacy and toxicity for optimal therapy. Application of the compound significantly decreased Gamma-Secretase activity in vitro and reduced levels of both Amyloid Beta 40 and 42 in N2a-APP695 cells. Observations in cell imaging and MTT viability assays suggested a non-toxic mechanism. Analysis of Notch-associated side effects revealed significant selectivity for APP Gamma-Secretase, with limited impact on Notch signaling. Particularly at low concentrations, AG879 exhibited effectiveness with insignificant mechanism-based toxicity, or Notch-associated side effects. Further investigation of the compound’s effects revealed an intriguing impact on intermediates in Amyloid Precursor Protein processing, which may be examined in future exploration of its mechanism of action. The findings suggest that Tyrphostin AG879 exhibits favorable characteristics and diplays significant potential for development as a safe, neuroprotective therapeutic for Alzheimer's Disease.

EFFECTS OF EXERCISES ON A DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 1
Haylee Elizabeth Jones
SUCCESS Academy, St. George, UT

Diabetes mellitus type 1 prevents the pancreas from producing insulin, in which case glucose cannot be converted into energy. In order to maintain blood glucose levels, type 1 diabetics self-inject insulin which allows them to have the advantage of a working pancreas. As a result, some do not diet and exercise since they can maintain with just insulin injections. But exercise is crucial for type 1 diabetics. Exercise helps contribute towards maintaining glucose and A1C levels. Granted, not all exercises are suitable for maintaining glucose levels. In order to recognize which exercise techniques benefit towards glucose levels the most, an experiment was performed where various exercise routines were executed, and glucose levels were tested with a blood glucose meter before and after each exercise. Also, glucose levels were monitored throughout the day to see the long term effect. Swimming, weight lifting, cycling, calisthenic workouts, running, and walking were all tested. It was assumed that running would be the most effective exercise towards maintaining blood sugar. After this experiment, it was found that the most beneficial exercises were running, swimming, and cycling because they are aerobic exercises and allowed the body to manually eliminate glucose without the presence of insulin. Weight lifting and calisthenics were the least beneficial and only increased glucose levels. In conclusion, aerobic exercises help improve type one diabetics daily glucose levels and significantly decreases their A1C.

SILVER NANOPARTICLES AFFECT CELL MESSENGER DELIVERY
Anushua Bhattacharya
East Ridge High School, Woodbury, MN

Nanotoxicology- the study involving the effect of nanoparticles (NPs) on cell toxicity- has received attention due to the prevalence of nanomaterials in consumer and medical products. Silver (Ag) NPs are widely used in various commercial products and in drug delivery. Because of the popularity of Ag NPs, assessing their cytotoxicity is essential in order to formulate a set of design rules to produce safe products. In this study, citrate capped Ag NPs of two different sizes (18 and 77 nm) were synthesized and exposed through passive exposure for 24 hours to murine adrenal medullary chromaffin (MAMC) cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed by detecting changes in exocytosis behavior using the Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Amperometry (CFMA) technique. Through amperometry, chromaffin cells under normal and Ag NP exposure conditions were stimulated to release epinephrine (chemical messenger molecules). Current versus time traces were collected for normal and NP exposure conditions for the two different sizes. Q (epinephrine released), t1/2 (rate of release) and frequency of release were calculated. Results showed there was no difference in Q (p>0.05). However, there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in t1/2 values for both sizes, and a decrease in frequency (p<0.05) for the larger size NP. The change under exposure conditions indicates that Ag NPs affect the rate of release and frequency at which epinephrine is released from the chromaffin cells. Such disturbances can lead to cancer related diseases.

NEW SMART WEAPONS: THERANOSTICS-- A NOVEL NANOMEDICINE APPROACH TO COMBAT CANCER
Angela Zhang
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Despite our knowledge about cancer, approximately 11 million people in US live with this incurable disease. Thus, I created a new generation of nanoparticles(NPs) with electronic-magnetic-optical-acoustical-thermal multimodality imaging, targeted drug delivery through near infared light (NIR) triggering of thermal therapy and drug release, and effective monitoring of treatment response through utilizing both therapeutics and diagnostics (theranostics) in a single platform. A new class of magnetic iron-oxide core gold-shell nanoparticles was synthesized through a novel coating method that allowed for the uniform formation of nanoparticles that are simultaneously compact in size and responsive to the NIR spectrum. Conjugation of EGFR-binding affibody, which specifically targets cancer cells, resulted in significant uptake of nanoparticles in epithelial cancer cells as compared to the normal cells. Evaluation of the NPs in cancer cells under MRI and photoacoustic imaging revealed increased sensitivity and resolution with dramatic reduction in background noise. The combination of thermal therapy and release of the chemodrug, Paclitaxel, through the breaking of conjugated bonds, both triggered by NIR, resulted in less than 2.4% cell survival in epithelial cancer cells as compared to 89.5% in untreated cells, or 15.9% in chemo-treated cells. Furthermore, treatment of the NP on multiple other cancer cell lines revealed comparable results. Moreover, the NPs targeted drug delivery system overcame chemoresistance and enhanced cancer therapy efficacy and safety. These novel multifunctional nanoparticles with enhanced imaging abilities for early detection of cancer and targeted therapy represents a revolution in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

The presented study was conducted to investigate the combined effect of inclusion of Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Bifidum) and Herbal formula composed of various kinds of herbs proven to have positive effects on lowering blood lipids in wester rat on their serum lipids, namely total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG).<br><br>The experimental diets included basal diet + Cholesterol (control diet), basal diet + cholesterol + Probiotics, basal diet + cholesterol + herbal formula 2% for 100 grams, basal diet + cholesterol + herbal formula 4% for 100 grams, basal diet + cholesterol + probiotics + herbal formula 2% for 100 grams, basal diet + cholesterol + probiotics + herbal formula 4% for 100 grams, basal diet + cholesterol + Statin (A commercial drug used to lower blood fats in a chemical way that has many body-harmful side effects). Animals were divided randomly, into seven groups (5rats/group). Each group was fed one of the seven diets for 8 weeks. <br><br>Data showed that all groups had made significant depression in blood lipids namely TC and TG. <br><br>The basal diet + cholesterol + probiotics + herbal formula 4% for 100 grams group showed the highest TC depression as compared with herbal and probiotics–fed groups, the (basal diet + cholesterol + herbal formula 4% for 100 grams) group showed greatest depression in TG even when compared with statinn drug. <br><br>Based on above-mentioned findings and the 1 to 2 rule, which states that a 1% reduction in blood cholesterol causes a 2% reduction in the risk for coronary heart disease, it can be concluded that the incorporation of probiotics and herbal formula to the diet have a positive effect in reducing blood lipids (particularly TC and TG) and be equivalent –in it's positive effect- to Statin Drug.

IMPROVING THE VISIBILITY OF NEEDLE TIPS IN ULTRASOUND IMAGES
Laura Lane Menezes
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

As medical procedures become less invasive, the use of percutaneous needle access is often required. Ultrasound guidance has been used in assisting an accurate puncture, however, the needle is not always easily seen, so the purpose of the experiment is to evaluate the echogenicity of three different types of needles (scratched, flat-end, standard) in a model where the angles of insertion were varied (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°). The expected result would be that the flattened needle would have higher visibility due to the fact that all beams would be directly sent back to the transducer. The method used was inserting each needle at different angles in both long-axis and short-axis visualization in a chicken breast, lard and gelatin model. Furthermore, a ramp of either silicon or gelatin was used to attempt an angle correction to improve visualization. All images were recorded with the help of a specialist. The results showed that the flat-end needle had a higher echogenicity compared to the standard and scratched needle. The type of medium changed the closeness to reality of the experiment and it was noted important formation of air bubbles that led to the easy, yet confusing identification of the needle position. The angle proved to have a more important role because all needles lost visibility in larger angles. Therefore, the hypothesis was proved correct since the flat-end needle showed better visualization. The visibility of the needles, regardless of the needle tip, will increase as it reaches the optimum angle of 90° in relation to the sound waves.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO WOUND THERAPY: THE EFFECT OF PLANT STEM CELLS ON MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS WHEN EXPOSED TO UV RADIATION
Meagan-Helen Henderson
Miss Edgar's and Miss Cramp's School, Westmount, Quebec, CANADA

Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are sensitive to, and easily harmed by, environmental stress factors, especially UV radiation. This limits their clinical use in wound therapy. A novel solution lies in plant stem cells with unique properties, namely <br><br>Uttwiler Spätlauber, Vitis vinifera, and Rosa pendulina stem cells. This study aims to determine if the addition of these plant stem cells to MSC culture will help to prevent the damage induced by various doses of UV radiation. Each type of plant stem cell was added to MSC culture and exposed to 1 min. (1.8 kJ), 4 min. (7.2 kJ), or 7 min. (12.6 kJ) of UV radiation every 24 hours for a period of 72 hours. The controls lacked plant stem cells. Uttwiler Spätlauber, Vitis vinifera, and <br><br>Rosa pendulina stem cells yielded statistically significant increases in the number of living MSCs and decreases in the number of dead MSCs, confirming their protective effect. Vitis vinifera and Rosa pendulina stem cells were the most potent protectors of the MSCs when exposed to 1 min. of UV radiation. Uttwiler Spätlauber stem cells offered the most extensive protection to the MSCs when exposed to 4 min. and 7 min. of UV radiation. The plant stem cells therefore inhibited the damaging effects of UV radiation. Through the performed research, the addition of plant stem cells to MSCs was discovered to be an innovative solution to improving the survival, as well as the functioning of MSCs during wound therapy.

IS IDENTIFYING AUTISM IN YOUTUBE VIDEOS POSSIBLE?
George Jefferson Lok
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Diagnosing autism requires a large amount of time and effort. This project investigates the feasibility of using the analysis of a short video clip to determine if a child is autistic. If possible, a prescreening tool that analyzes videos of potentially autistic children can be developed to reduce the amount of time and effort needed for diagnosis, which allows for early intervention.<br><br> YouTube videos of children were analyzed. A protocol recognized the distinct behavior of an autistic child in videos by employing a question-based analysis without ever observing the child directly and only using video clips. The questions came from the Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule (ADOS) consisting of 29 questions and a subset of the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R) consisting of 4 questions. An autistic behavior characterized by social impairments will have a non-zero score for each question. The more elevated the social impairments the higher the score. Twenty videos of non-autistic children and 50 videos of autistic children were identified and 10 videos of non-autistic children and 10 videos of autistic children were randomly selected to be analyzed.<br><br> The results show that the highest scores for ADOS and ADI-R in the non-autistic videos were 3 and 1 (average 1.5 and 0.4) respectively while the lowest scores for ADOS and ADI-R in the autistic videos were 11 and 3 (average 23.4 and 6.5) respectively. A simple score threshold (ADOS>7 or ADI-R>2 = autistic) classifies the videos of autistic subjects with 100% accuracy.<br><br> Both tests confirm that it is possible to determine whether a child is autistic by analyzing the child’s behavior in a video, demonstrating that the development of a video analysis tool for the prescreening of autism is achievable.

GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN: CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS
John Albert Villarrubia
Saint Paul's School, Covington, LA

Gluten is an additive found in breads, cereals, processed foods, and natural flavorings. It is produced by plants. Gluten prevents the body from absorbing certain nutrients causing diseases such as celiac disease. It is linked to overactive neurons that cause motor neuron diseases and hormonal ramifications. Information about this claim was based on research findings. These facts lead to the forming of a hypothesis. If gluten was dissolved in water and mixed with a food supply for the Drosophila melanogaster, then after exposure the drosophila will exhibit abnormal behaviors, lower reproducibility, defer from food, mutate, or die. The experiment was conducted by analyzing the effect gluten has on the flies: (1) create several different gluten solutions and mix them with food supply, (2) place the flies in their respective containers, (3) observe them for behavior, frequency of observable genetic mutations that were exposed as larvae and life cycle data, (4) the results of each set were displayed with visual pictures, graphs, and charts. The data analysis was comparable to trail logs.<br><br>The findings agreed with the hypothesis if the food allergen was dissolved in water and mixed with a food supply for the drosophila melanogaster, then after exposure the drosophila will exhibit abnormal behaviors, lower productivity, have abnormalities in their offspring, defer from food, mutate, or die. This project proved that overuse of the food gluten was harmful to the drosophila and possibly in people. It provided awareness of the effects gluten has on the body, its symptoms, causes, and treatments. It also helps to educate others and provide evidence that more research and supports groups with innovative ideas are needed.

TESTING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN B7-H1 AND PTEN SIGNAL EXPRESSION IN KIDNEY CANCER CELLS
Michael Charles Zaiken
Century High School, Rochester, MN

Drug resistance is a critical health issue in cancer chemotherapy. B7-H1 is a cell signal protein that is believed to operate as a survival factor in cancer cells by preventing host immune response; however the chemical mechanism that it uses is largely unknown. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if B7-H1 operates as a survival factor in kidney cancer cells, meaning that it increases the cells’ drug resistance, by effecting the expression of PTEN (a protein that causes apoptosis or cell death) following chemotherapy. This experiment hypothesizes that the, chemotherapy induced, up-regulation of B7-H1 down-regulates the expression of PTEN, thereby increasing the survival of the cancer cells. Kidney cancer cells were treated with Rapamycin (a drug associated with increased B7-H1 expression). Cells were cultured in graded solutions of Rapamycin. First, cells were counted and B7-H1 expression measured with flow cytometry. Second, cells were cultured under the same conditions, counted daily, and the PTEN expression was measured after treatment. After treatment, cancer cells initially died off, but some cells survived. The surviving cells up-regulated their expression of B7-H1 and down-regulated their expression of PTEN. Once the surviving cells expanded, their expression of B7-H1 also increased. The data shows that following treatment with chemotherapy, cancer cells mobilize a pro-survival mechanism by increasing the pro-survival factor, B7-H1, and reducing the cell death molecule PTEN. This correlation was found to be statistically significant (R2 =0.9292). Thus tumors may increase their capacity for survival, as a mechanism to become drug resistant.

DENTAL SEALANT DETERIORATION
Azad Sunil Dhingra
Springfield High School, Springfield, OH

What is the comparison in deterioration of the tooth sealant after being saturated in Cola, Iced Tea, Citrus Soda, Black Coffee with added sugar, Diet Cola, Diet Iced Tea, Diet Citrus Soda, and sugar free Black Coffee? The hypothesis suggested that if the occlusal surface of molars are sealed and then saturated in eight different solutions, then the Cola will deteriorate the tooth sealant the most and Diet Iced Tea will deteriorate it the least. Eight teeth – molars – were obtained from a local dentist. Each tooth was covered with a dental sealant, and the mass (g) of each tooth was found. The teeth were then placed into eight separate sterile cups containing 20mL distilled water. Eight solutions were acquired (pH found) and poured into sterile cups – one solution per cup. Next, all eight teeth were taken and placed in 25mL of each solution for seven and a half minutes, twice a day and then placed back into the distilled water. Every two days, the teeth were observed and the mass was measured. After the full ten days, the new mass of the tooth was compared to that of the original tooth: The difference in mass (g) represented the deterioration of the dental sealant. The results showed that the hypothesis was correct. The dental sealant saturated in Cola deteriorated 4.65% (the greatest), while the sealant soaked in Diet Iced Tea only deteriorated 2.25%. This proves that both acidity and sugar play large roles in the deterioration of dental sealants.

MODES OF ACTION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AS A PROBIOTIC IN GLUCOSE OR OMEGA-3 DIET SUPPLEMENTS IN MONOGASTRIC SPECIES IN VITRO AGAINST ESCHERICHIA COLI
Fiona Lynn Kearns
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of S. cerevisiae against E. coli. It has been proposed that S. cerevisiae is an antagonist against E. coli as the bacteria agglutinate (adhere) to the yeast cell wall and the complex is eliminated.<br><br>Two experiments were performed. The first, designed to test the effects of S. cerevisiae on E. coli. Here 5 groups of 20 plates prepared based off dilution factors: 102 S. cerevisiae vs. no E. coli; 104 S. cerevisiae vs. no E. coli; 102 S. cerevisiae vs.102 E. coli; 104 S. cerevisiae vs. 102 E. coli; 102 E. coli vs. no S. cerevisiae. The second, designed to discern the dietary conditions under which S. cerevisiae performs the best as a probiotic. Here 4 groups of 20 plates were prepared plated with 5ml of 102 S. cerevisiae and 102 E. coli each with a total of 10 ml of the following additives: glucose and omega-3; omega-3 and distilled water; glucose and distilled water; distilled water alone. Samples of each culture for each experiment were prepared, combined, stirred for 30 minutes, plated.<br><br>The hypothesis, E. coli cultured with S. cerevisiae will have a higher rate of agglutination to yeast indicated by a higher count agglutinated E. coli colonies, was supported by the data. Furthermore, data showed that E. coli agglutinates in constant ratio, thus yeast supplementation could be clinically dosed. The hypothesis, S. cerevisiae cultured with glucose will have greater probiotic effect, was partially supported in the second experiment.

IN SILICO EXPLORATION OF ABERRANT METHYLATION
Achutha Narayana Raman
Dover-Sherborn Regional High School, Dover, MA

This study describes an in silico methodology to quantify the total level of abnormality for a specific subset of genes in a patient sample, and uses this information to predict onset of certain cancers. Research sought to identify a process using computational methods and clinical methylation data to estimate methylation proclivity of specific human genes reportedly impacted by cancerous hyper- and hypo-methylation (type-c and tumor causing), doing this with high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The purpose was to come up with a verifiable methodology to “biomark” or systematically predict presence of a specific cancer, based on relative abnormality of the patient’s epigenome.<br><br> The three-part process utilized in this project involved estimation of baseline level methylation, cancer biomarker identification for each of the twenty cancers analyzed, and prediction accuracy validation ultimately using references from thousands of wet-lab samples. Combining CpG island prediction methods with promoter region identification, multiple sequence alignment, logos entropy analysis, and oligonucleotide statistics, the cross-validated results of this BioPython based method have high accuracy (80-95% for variations), specificity (90%), and sensitivity (approaching 65%), significantly optimizing the results obtained by earlier pioneering in silico approaches (Feltus et al., 2003; Bock et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008).<br><br> Extended results evidence potential for application in early detection, progression assessment, and determination of susceptibility to a particular type of treatment for bile duct, bladder, cervical, duodenum, endocrine, esophageal, kidney, larynx, lymphoma, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, oral, and testicular cancers.

AT THE BEAT OF MY HEART
Hope Georgia Goode
Garretson High School, Garretson, SD

The purpose of this project was to see what the effects of music are on the heart rate and blood pressure of the listener. I also wanted to see if one genre had more effect than another. My hypothesis was that metal would raise heart rate and blood pressure, while jazz and classical would lower them and country would have little effect.<br><br> I conducted my experiment using a heart rate/ blood pressure monitor, a music device, and a set of headphones. I had my participants sit in a chair next to the monitor with a resting period of two minutes. After resting I tested their heart rate and blood pressure followed by listening to music for two minutes. After they had listened to music for two minutes I monitored them again and continued to the next person. I found that, on average, classical lowered heart rate and blood pressure the most. While metal also lowered blood pressure like every other genre, it had the least amount of effect. As for country and jazz, they had similar effects of raising the heart rate and slightly lowering blood pressure.<br><br> In conclusion, I believe that the calmness or urgency of music as well as age group have a large part in determining how we react to it. If I continue in this project I will base my hypothesis and testing more on the tempo and urgency of the music as well as using more than one age group.

THE EFFECTS OF CAPSAICIN ON SENSORY PERCEPTION
Micah Joseph Hill
South High School, Minneapolis, MN

Last year it was determined that consuming spicy food appears to increase distance eye sight. This year the researcher wanted to know if consuming capsaicin (the main chemical that makes food spicy) would enhance the performance of all of the senses. It was hypothesized that consuming capsaicin would enhance all the senses’ performance by at least 5%. Participants took an eye exam (from three feet away), hearing test, two-point discrimination test (touch), taste recognition test, and a smell recognition test. The researcher then gave the same fifteen test subjects one serving of a popular spicy snack food. The test subjects then retook the tests. An equal number of participants followed the same procedure except that they ate the non-spicy variety of this snack food (no capsaicin). All of the control group average results decreased in perception. All of the experimental group average results increased. There were respective differences of 1.88 cm, 32%, 19%, 18.71% dB, and 34% between the spicy and non-spicy group in the test results of the sight, taste, touch, hearing, and smell tests. The results showed that consuming capsaicin appears to enhance eyesight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing. After conducting an ANOVA test, the results were shown to be statistically significant in all cases.

Mark Lloyd Granaderos Dapar
Bayugan National Comprehensive High School, Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, PHILIPPINES

Rice bran is a byproduct of rice milling process which contains significant amount of natural phytochemicals. The IR64 rice variety is a high-yielding, semi-dwarf and mostly grown variety in the tropics. This study aims to determine the cytotoxic and antioxidant potentials of IR64 rice bran.<br><br> The sample was subjected to sequential extraction using hexane and ethanol. The concentrated extracts were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The cytotoxic activity of hexane and ethanol extracts was analyzed using the methyl thiazol tetrazollium (MTT) Assay for human lung and colon carcinomas. Both extracts were also analyzed by Cytotoxicity Assay using lymphocytes from normal blood. The antioxidant property was evaluated by free radical diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay.<br><br> The result of MTT Assay revealed that ethanol extract inhibit proliferation of human lung and colon carcinomas at 10181 µg/ml and 6650 µg/ml, respectively. The ethanol extract demonstrated 79.79% inhibition against DPPH. Based on the cytoxicity assay conducted, it shows that the sample is not toxic to normal cells (lymphocytes) having an average of only 14 cells died at a 193 cell population (7.25 per 100 cells) compared to the base cell medium as untreated control and 2.5% DMSO in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). No cytotoxicity and antioxidant potentials were exhibited by the hexane extract.<br><br> It was concluded that IR64 rice bran ethanol extract is a potential source of bioactive compound/s as cytotoxic agent against both human lung and colon carcinomas and potential antioxidant against free radicals. Thus, a promising source of treatment for chemotherapy and chemoprevention.

EFFECTS OF DIABETES MELLITUS ON VASCULOGENESIS CAPACITIES OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS
Shubha Srinivas Raghvendra
Saint Francis High School, Mountain View, CA

Purpose: Underlying complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) is impaired vasculogenesis. Vasculogenesis (wound healing) involves recruitment of progenitor cell populations, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), to assemble neovessels. The goal of the project is to elucidate the biological mechanisms of diabetic MSC dysfunction in vasculogenesis. The hypothesis was that both proliferation and stemness of MSCs were compromised by DM. <br><br>Methods & Data: Bone marrow MSCs were harvested from wild type and db/db (Type II diabetic mice) and grown in high- and low-glucose conditions to assess proliferation and stemness of MSCs. Robust proliferation rates were evaluated using immunostaining for presence of ki67, a nuclear protein. Results indicated that diabetic MSC proliferation is reduced compared to a wild type standard in low- (-41.8%, p<0.009) and high-glucose conditions (-29.6%, p<10^-6). TUNEL staining was conducted to evaluate apoptosis as a mechanism to explain proliferation trends. Results indicated that apoptosis is likely not responsible for decreased proliferation; diabetic apoptosis was actually decreased (-72.8%, p<10^-8). MSC stemness was assessed using western blotting for protein encoded by KLF4. Blots indicated that KLF4 expression (and stemness) was compromised in diabetic MSCs in high- and low-glucose conditions.<br><br>Conclusion: The conclusion of this study – that diabetic MSCs exhibit lower rates of proliferation and lower capacity for differentiation – is an important step in understanding the mechanisms of MSC dysfunction in DM.

LOSS OF CHAOS IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE: USING FRACTAL MATHEMATICS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF THE DECOUPLING OF THE BASAL GANGLIA FROM THE CORTEX IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Leah Avi Balay-Wilson
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose: To develop quantitative measures that link a primary symptom of Parkinson's disease, rest tremor, to pathological brain processes using a previously validated dataset. When untreated, rest tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease should have a lower fractal dimension compared to patients receiving treatment.<br><br>Methods: Developed and implemented a computer program in MATLAB to determine the fractal dimension (FD) of rest tremor velocity. Fifty-five anonymized recordings of rest tremor velocity were obtained from subjects with Parkinson's disease. All subjects were receiving both deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication treatment. Rest tremor was compared within each subject under four treatment combinations using ANOVA with multiple comparisons.<br><br>Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in FD (p = 0.03) with successive increases in treatment. Mean (± standard deviation) FD in the untreated condition 1.40 (±0.37) increased to 1.95 (±0.11) when DBS and medication were combined. The additive nature of DBS and medication in controlling rest tremor was demonstrated; both treatments worked more effectively than either alone. Quantitative techniques that link brain pathology to symptoms in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders may be used in the future to detect the presence of brain pathology before symptoms develop.

Hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) are common genetic diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. Hemoglobinopathies affect hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells. These abnormal hemoglobin molecules distort red blood cells into sickle cells causing vascular complications leading to high morbidity and mortality. Symptoms can be treated by reactivating human fetal hemoglobin which contains gamma-globin subunits. A natural condition called hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) results in elevated fetal hemoglobin production even in the adult stage of life. In non-deletional HPFH, genetic mutations in the gamma-globin gene cause increased gamma-globin synthesis. The -175 (T to C) and -195 (C to G) mutations were hypothesized to create HPFH conditions. In this study novel mouse models were created using human beta-yeast artificial chromosome transgenesis to analyze the effect of these mutations on human gamma-globin gene expression. Results show that both mutations significantly increase gamma-globin gene expression and this identification opens new avenues for treatments of hemoglobinopathies.

NEURAL NETWORK DIAGNOSTICS FOR BREAST CANCER
Brittany Michelle Wenger
The Out-of-Door Academy, Sarasota, FL

How can the power of computing be harnessed for the greater good? Artificial neural networks detect patterns too complex to be recognized by humans and applying them to the medical field can have far reaching impact. For example, breast cancer will inflict one in eight women. This project explores the capability for successful neural network application on breast cancer detection of malignant and benign tumors.<br><br>Building on data collected by the University of Wisconsin in the early 1990s, this project evaluates three modern neural network implementations. Information regarding potential indicators of breast cancer is quantified in the dataset; specifically, clump thickness, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, mitoses, and five other attributes. Each network accepts this input to optimize its hidden nodes and is tested with ten trials. With each trial, a randomly selected 10% of the dataset is used to assess the predictive power of the constructed neural network. <br><br>Of the three networks, two achieved consistent success while the third experienced erratic success. With thirty trials, three achieved 100% predictive success. The best neural network obtained an average efficiency of 97.3% across 700 test samples. This experiment demonstrates modern neural networks can handle outliers and work with unmodified datasets to identify patterns. Evolving the research to where it is suitable for actual breast cancer diagnosis would require further tuning to reduce malignant false negative instances. Although these neural networks may not be ready to diagnose actual patients today, the potential to improve breast cancer detection is real.

THE EFFECTS OF NEURONAL INJURY: SURVIVAL, RETRACTION, OR WALLERIAN DEGENERATION?
Jai Nitish Thakor
River Hill High School, Clarksville, MD

Prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries lead to damage of Central Nervous System axons (axonopathy), which can alter or impair electrical conduction and connectivity. The goal of this project is to study the effects of injury to an axon and the outcome (survival or degeneration). This study was carried out using a novel in vitro platform to simulate axonal trauma and evaluate axonal degradation. The platform was a microfabricated, multi-compartment device built using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material to make two sets of microchannels (500 micrometers x 10 micrometers x 3 micrometers) to guide the axons through three distinct compartments (8 mm, 1 mm, 150 micrometers) for cell bodies, proximal/medial axonal bodies and distal axonal processes. This unique platform allowed observation of the effect of different pressures on the time taken for axonal degeneration. The experiments showed that low pressure injury (5.60 ± 1.86 hrs) took a longer time to degenerate than high pressure injury (4.14 ± 2.05 hrs). The results also showed that high-pressure injury degenerated the quickest (-27.81 ± 36.75 micrometers/hr), followed by low-pressure injury (-8.29 ± 2.91 micrometers/hr). Additionally, three outcomes of axonal injury were observed: some axons survived and regenerated, those injured with low pressure unexpectedly retracted, and those injured with high pressure underwent Wallerian degeneration. These results suggest that retraction as a result of low pressure injury may be a part of the axonal defensive process. This discovery of retraction after mild axonal injury should lead to developing better strategies for axon survival. The microfabricated platform should be useful for investigating neuroprotection and regeneration.

EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF THE SEROTONERGIC SYSTEM DURING NEURONAL CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Dominique Rachelle Benson
Murrah High School, Jackson, MS

Differentiation of neuroblastoma cells into neuronal cells is characterized by neuritic outgrowth and expression of 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1A), a marker of the serotonergic system. 5-HT1A mediates inhibitory effects in serotonergic pathways. Binding of serotonin to 5-HT1A located on serotonergic neurons decreases neuronal firing rate and serotonin release. Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is used to treat depression. Acutely, citalopram blocks serotonin reuptake causing an increase in serotonin levels at the synapse. However, it takes at least three weeks of treatment before clinical improvement is observed which correlates with a reduction in serotonin 5-HT1A autoreceptors, disinhibition of serotonergic neurons, enhancement of neuronal firing rate and serotonin release. The two to three week latency for efficacy of antidepressant therapy suggests that long-term changes are required in the serotonin pathway before beneficial effects can be seen. Herein, we hypothesize that the reduction in expression of 5-HT1A autoreceptors during citalopram treatment occurs due to an increase in the extent of methylation of the promoter sequences of the 5HT-1A autoreceptor gene. We have used citalopram treated neuroblastoma cells as an experimental system, real time polymerase chain reaction based DNA methylation assays to study the extent of methylation of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor gene. Data obtained have been correlated with 5-HT1A mRNA and protein expression levels. This study is expected to shed light on whether epigenetic changes in serotonergic genes may partially explain the developmental adverse effects occasionally reported in children who were exposed to SSRI in utero.

THE EFFECTS OF HELICAL MODIFICATION ON SIMULATED ACL GRAFTS
Caroline Kaye Clothiaux
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, MO

Tendon grafts are used to reconstruct Anterior Ligament tears. Graft stiffness is an important factor associate with function. This can be achieved by increasng the graft diameter. Because of the limited space within the knee joint other chnages such as applying a helix to a graft could improve graft performance.<br><br>The tendons wer thawed dn warmed to room temperature in a water bath. From there they were diessected from the sheath. A locking suture was placed throughe achend of the tendons. The tendons were placed into four seperate groups: group A was the single bundle control group; group B was the single bungle 360 degree helix; group C wast eh single bundle with a 720 degree helix; and groud D was the double bundle group containing a control, a 360, and a 720 degree specimen. The specimens were placed int he Graftmaster III and were loaded in 2.5kg incriments up to 20kg. Length and diameters were measured for each specimen. The stress and strain relationships were determined.<br><br>THe relationships between the specimens were determined. The data showed that the specimens with no helix were more elastic, and as one helix was added then two, the tendons became stiffer and stronger. Tho further compare the changes in stiffness of the specimens the ration of enlonation applied force was calculated. The values demonstrated decreasing elasticity as the helixes increased.<br><br>The introduction of a helix to a tendon graft will decrease the elasticity of a tendon, producing a stiffer graft for ACL reconstruction.

KLF4 AND KLF4-ALPHA: WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT PANCREATIC CANCER
Jiawen Wei
Bellaire Senior High School, Bellaire, TX

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease that has the worst prognosis among all malignant diseases. Because of its resistance to current treatment methods such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, extensive research to find novel and effective therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Previous studies published in scientific literature showed that KLF4 has tumor suppressing functions in gastrointestinal cancers, including pancreatic cancer. While defining the alterations of KLF4 in pancreatic cancer, KLF4-alpha, an alternative splicing variant of KLF4, was identified. Based on background research, the hypothesis for this project is that KLF4α has a tumor promoting function, and the activation of KLF4 or suppression of KLF4-alpha expression may have therapeutic effects on pancreatic cancer. To test this hypothesis, real time RT-PCR was used to detect the expression levels of KLF4 and KLF4-alpha in pancreatic cancer cells. The MTT Assay, FACS Cell Cycle Analysis, Western Blot, and Luciferase Assay were used to determine the effect of KLF4 and KLF4-alpha on pancreatic cancer cell growth. A vegetable nutrient component, DIM (Diindolylmethane), and KLF4-alpha; small interfering RNA were used to modulate KLF4 and KLF4-alpha; expressions to see the effect of increasing KLF4 or decreasing KLF4-alpha; expression on pancreatic cancer growth. The results showed that KLF4-alpha; expression is much higher in pancreatic cancer cells, and that it does have a tumor promoting property in pancreatic cancer. Also, using DIM to upregulate KLF4 or siRNA to knock down KLF4-alpha is effective in slowing down pancreatic cancer cell growth and thus may be potent approaches for pancreatic cancer therapy.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO MODELING GENETIC SENSORY IMPAIRMENTS THROUGH DE NOVO PREDICTION OF MUTANT PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Rebecca Faye Alford
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Sensory impairments constitute a large group of inherited neurological spectrum disorders, most commonly visual and hearing impairments. However, variable expression hinders characterization and understanding of these disorders, resulting in common misdiagnoses and limited treatment options. Since protein structure ultimately determines function, a system that measures differences in structure and the subsequent changes in function between wild type and mutant variants can be used to track the expression of impairments. A computational system was developed in Java using a De Novo secondary structure prediction approach that works by simulating the in vivo folding process. Recursive processing of folding steps generates structure predictions. Functional impact was determined by scoring the relationship between composition of secondary structure changes and structural domains of significance in wild type variants. The system was tested with null mutations and results agreed with clinical observations. Tests were then executed by running selected protein models with several variants through the system. Results revealed measurable functional differences based on folding patterns and resulting structures. A preliminary spectrum of functional impacts was also identified through running multiple variants for a given protein model. These findings represent the system’s potential to measure symptoms of impairments based on protein structure, leading to identification of molecular targets for early detection, proper diagnosis and treatment.

IFN-GAMMA THERAPY: A NOVEL APPROACH TO CURBING THE PROPAGATION OF MALIGNANT PROSTATE CANCER CELLS
Jay D. Shah
Mission San Jose High School, Fremont, CA

Increased understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the incidence and development of prostate cancer is imperative for overcoming the current medical and biological hurdles presented by this disease. Beta Catenin, a nuclear transcription-modifying molecule, is an oncogenic protein in prostate cancer involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. Beta Catenin is up-regulated in prostate cancer cells because the normal complexes which degrade Beta Catenin are inhibited. To counteract this, I employed a MLK-3 ligand previously shown to be active in the Wnt signaling pathway. This experiment examined the effect of Interferon (IFN)-gamma on the propagation of Beta Catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway. IFN-gamma was titrated at concentrations of 0 IU, 500 IU, and 1000 IU with 22RV1 cells and allowed to incubate for 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. After incubation, proteins were extracted and total protein concentration measured via protein assay and β-Catenin determined via Western blot. The data show that as the blot area (β-Catenin concentration) increases from 6221.163 pixels2 to 11702.012 pixels2, the overall change in protein concentration does not increase, but rather decreases slightly (74.52% to 72.47%.) This suggests that IFN gamma increases the concentration of Beta-Catenin but inhibits its participation in transcriptional activity. Thus, if IFN-gamma can be synthesized using receptors such as heparin sulfate, it could be used therapeutically to reduce the alterations of genetic coding and consequently, the propagation of malignant prostate cells.

NEW SCREENING METHOD FOR COLON CANCER - DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD BY MRNA EXPRESSION MARKERS
Anna Molnar
Fazekas Mihaly Fovarosi Altalanos Iskola es Gyakorlo Gimnazium, Budapest, HUNGARY

Cancer of the colon is a leading cancer type worldwide which results in death in most cases. Early discovery is needed for effective therapy. My work yields a new method for screening. If somebody has colon cancer, an examination with colonoscopy has to be done which is terribly uncomfortable. As a result of my research, colon cancer can be detected from the blood with a non-expensive and very sensitive method which can be available in every hospital. Blood samples can be easily taken with a syringe and anyone can endure this short, painless procedure. Blood means a connection between every point of the organism. In this way, it can provide information which means molecular markers about the state and function of various organs. These markers mean mRNA, which can show us the genes connected with colon cancer. In order to identify these genes I applied Affymetrix whole genomic mRNA expression arrays (microchips). This examination was done with 40 tumorous (colon cancer) and 38 healthy samples at 87.5% sensitivity and 10% false positive rate and 6 genes were identified which are overexpressed in tumorous samples. This examination was also done with 12 samples with adenoma (the previous stage before cancer) and 16 healthy samples at 87% sensitivity and 12% false positive rate and 7 genes were identified which are overexpressed in adenoma samples. So if these genes can be detected (or they are overexpressed) from blood, the patient has colon cancer/adenoma. As I had already known the sequences of these genes, I searched for them in blood using Real-Time PCR (as a validation of the results of microchips). This RT-PCR technology could be used in practice because it is not expensive, easy to use and every hospital has this equipment. So it is a new screening method.

STUDY OF LARVICIDAL ACTION OF "MELAO-DE-SAO-CAETANO" (MORMODICA CHARANTIA) IN AEDES AEGYPTI VECTOR CONTROL
Rafael Carmo da Costa
EEEFM Profa Benvinda de Araujo Pontes, Abaetetuba, PA, BRASIL

The present research studies the larvacide potentiality of the herb melon of Sao Caetano (“melao-de-sao-caetano”, Mormodica charantia). This idea emerged after investigating natural methods to combat lice, which drove me to learn about several therapeutic properties attributed to this plant and its widespread popular use as lousiness, vermifuge, antirheumatic, hypoglycemic, antifungal among many others. Aware of the preventive actions to control outbreak vectors of parasitic human diseases like malaria, dengue and yellow fever, and the frequent use of toxic substances as 1-"fogging" that can result in hitting other species of small sizes and 2- temephos considered carcinogenic, my goal was to find alternatives that can add to those already existing, by natural means, easy to use, and not harmful to the environment. Therefore, I developed this research in order to evaluate the action of extracts from leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds of “melão-de-são-caetano” on the larvae Aedes aegypti because it is the most common mosquito in the municipality of Abaetetuba and the population is often infected with dengue. Dry and liquid extracts of fresh leaves, dried leafs powder, seeds and pulps resulting from the extraction of juice, fruit bark and flowers were all used with positive results and with differential action time. Therefore, by using electrical equipments I could confirm the larvicidal action of the plant and its efficiency when used in the form of pellets produced from fresh leaves. However, further research is needed to isolate and identify the bioactive substances.

In this experiment, the experimenter investigated the question: How does the diameter of the blood vessels affect the pressure gradient within the blood vessels and the required workload of the heart? The experimenter predicted that the workload of the heart will increase as the diameter of the blood vessel decreases and as the flow rate of the blood increases.<br><br>To conduct this experiment, the experimenter connected the tubes to an artificial heart. After that, normal saline was put into the tubes through a lure lock connected to the circuit. After removing all air from the system, the experimenter turned on the console. To zero the system, the experimenter set the flow rate to two liters per minute, then clamped the tubing distal to the flow probe, which should cause a reading of zero. The flow rate was then adjusted to read zero using the gain adjustment on the console. The experimenter then released the clamp and began recording data in 1 liter increments. To conduct the trials, the experimenter turned the flow knob to zero, then to one liter per minute, and recorded how many revolutions per minute the artificial heart required to pump the saline through the system by reading the flow rate. The experimenter measured the pressure in three different locations within the circuit by reading the H-P monitor. Then, the experimenter repeated the process with the other seven flow rates. Once the trials were completed, the experimenter used the same process for the other two tubing sizes.<br><br>The hypothesis the experimenter made was correct. The workload of the artificial heart did increase as the diameter decreased and the flow rate increased.

RISK ASSESSMENT OF ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM RUPTURE USING FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION SIMULATIONS
Sagar Hitendra Rambhia
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Computer-aided diagnosis is a highly targeted research subject in diagnostic radiology and medical imaging. AAA complexities include a mortality rate of 50-75% (ruptured) and incorrect application of endovascular repair. The primary objective of this study was to develop a patient specific rupture potential index (RPI) as a computer generated diagnostic tool to augment Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAAs) surgery assessment. Systematically, CT scans (n = 30 subjects) were reconstructed in 3D by means of Gambit reconstruction and outputs were degraded into Delaunay triangular elements in Adina using specific material properties (intraluminal thrombus (ILT), pathological wall, normal wall) to simulate structure. MATLAB was used to calculate RPI via stress and strength calculations. Comparisons of the stress between normal and pathological cases using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations indicate significance of such methods (p = 7.42E-5). Simulation results concluded aneurysm diameter was not a major contributor in the overall stress calculation (p = .69). The ILT in all simulations reduced overall stress significantly (p = 3.25049E-05). All of the known ruptured locations (n = 6) were accurately predicted. Conclusions indicate current methods that determine AAA growth rate and diameter as surgical guidelines should be reevaluated. In the future, the study would aim to evaluate the effect hypertension related cardiovascular diseases aneurysm rupture potentials. This technology would also be integrated as computer systems in care facilities and hospitals to reduce patient mortality and morbidity, and the burden on the healthcare system.

GALLOCYANINE CHROME ALUM COMPLEX: A NOVEL HISTOCHEMICAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING CONTRAST AGENT
Alexander Prodromos Gilbert
Saint Albans School, DC, DC

The development of target-specific histochemical stains that provide micro structural tissue differentiation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exemplifies an emerging area of research. <br><br>Gallocyanine can be mordanted with metals and is a well-known histological stain for anionic biopolymers. This work describes the chemical synthesis of gallocyanine chrome alum complex and studies its performance as an MRI contrast agent. Synthesis of the gallocyanine chrome alum complex was verified by UV spectroscopy and the compound diffused effectively in ex vivo human brain block tissue sample. The brain MRI scans obtained in a high-strength 7.0 Tesla magnetic field revealed fine structural details within the gray matter that were undetectable in the pre-stain scans. The experimental hypothesis was confirmed: due to the presence of chromium in the complex, MR longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2*) proton relaxation times decreased compared with the pre-stain scans, especially in gray matter tissues. This is the first application of the gallocyanine chrome alum complex as an MRI contrast agent and has potential applicability in a wide range of medical studies.

MECHANISTIC STUDY OF SULFORAPHANE INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY
Angela Jin Han
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

This study was to determine whether Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanates (ITCs) compound, induced cytotoxicity through the thiol mechanism. In this study, acetylcysteine (NAC) acted as “bait,” serving as a false thiol target for Sulforaphane. The hypothesis states that NAC will protect the cancer cell from Sulforaphane induced cytotoxicity. In the experiment, four levels of Sulforaphane concentrations (0 µM, 2.2 µM, 6.6 µM, and 20 µM) without NAC and with the presence of 3 mM of NAC were tested. After the cancer cells were added into different levels of Sulforaphane solutions, the solution was incubated, and tested for the percentage of surviving cells through MTT Assay. The data was collected and analyzed. In order to analyze the results of the experiment, one tail, independent t-test was performed. The p-value of the t-test is 3.46649E-05 for 2.2 µM level, 7.18588 E-15 for 6.6 µM level, 1.06081E-13 for 20 µM level of Sulforaphane. Because the results are all smaller than the alpha value of 0.05, the results support the hypothesis. It was concluded that the percentage of cancer cell survival was higher in the presence of NAC under Sulforaphane induced cytotoxicity than without the presence of NAC.

TRINOVOPAN: PRE-CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ANTI-CANCER COMBINATIONAL THERAPY
Lingjie (Linda) Wei
Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School, Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA

Cancer – a single word that has a profound impact on so many.<br><br>Each year, cancer accounts for 7.4 million deaths, an estimated 12% of annual global mortality. Leukemia, in particular T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), has one of the highest mortality rates for any cancer, being reported lethal in more than 80% of cases. Even more alarming is the increasing number of situations where chemotherapy fails to eradicate T-ALL due to cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR).<br><br>Trinovopan is an original anti-cancer drug that aims to unite the strengths of a unique herbal combination to provide a more holistic alternative to current chemotherapy. In this pre-clinical investigation of Trinovopan, varying dosages and combinations of the drug were tested on Jurkat T-ALL cells in a series of MTS assays to determine the optimal composition, dosage, and treatment schedule.<br><br>Trinovopan has been revealed to be a potent anti-cancer agent due to the highly synergistic effects of its components. Moreover, through the results of experimentation and research, it is likely that Trinovopan induces targeted lymphoblastic apoptosis through methylanthraquinone-induced caspase activation, with significantly better apoptotic rates for fibronectin-adhered T-cells than conventional chemotherapy. These results cast a positive light on this novel treatment, suggesting it should be a well-balanced and safe alternative to chemotherapy in the lymphoblastic stages of T-ALL. They give us hope that Trinovopan may be a key to overcoming leukemia in the near future.

MODULATION OF ERK5 IN INHIBITING BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION AND INVASION
Grace Yang Wang
A. B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with death from this disease mostly due to cancer metastasis rather than the effects of the primary tumor. Therefore, searching for a novel therapeutic target for preventing cancer metastasis is of critical importance to cancer therapy. Two key steps involved in metastasis are cancer cell migration and invasion. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) is an enzyme that regulates gene/protein expressions through phosphorylation. Preliminary studies have shown that ERK5 phosphorylation is downregulated by cdc42, a protein involved in upregulating cancer cell migration and invasion. However, the role of ERK5 in regulating migration and invasion of breast cancer cells is poorly defined. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of modulated ERK5 expression in breast cancer cell migration and invasion.<br><br> Results demonstrated that downregulating ERK5-phosphorylation by silencing RNA significantly increased migration and invasion of breast cancer cells (Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cell lines) in the Transwell migration and invasion assays. In contrast, upregulating ERK5-phosphorylation through constitutively-active MEK5-adenovirus markedly decreased migration and invasion of cancer cells in the same assays. Immunofluorescence staining also showed significantly lower ERK5 expression in tumor tissue than in non-cancerous tissue. Based on these findings, it was concluded that tumor tissues have low ERK5 expression, and upregulation of ERK5 effectively inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that ERK5 is a potential target for preventing breast cancer metastasis. This study will form a valuable basis when developing a novel strategy for cancer therapy.

EFFECT OF QUERCETIN ON EPITHELIAL CANCER CELL LINE
Joanie Marie Nina
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The resistance of various types of tumors to conventional treatments leads the scientific community to investigate new therapeutic strategies for fatal diseases, such as cancer. Quercetin is a flavonoid that has piqued the curiosity of many, because of its antioxidant, antiproliferative, healing properties, and especially its mutagenicity. Studies indicate that quercetin has the ability to inhibit various types of cancer cells. This research’s goal was to explore the anticancer effects of quercetin on tumor cell line A431 in order to open paths for future research that will seek treatment for fatal diseases, using substances of organic origin. The hypothesis was that quercetin would decrease the percentage of cell viability of the A431 tumor cells as the concentration increased, compared to unexposed control cells. The quantitative results obtained in the cytotoxicity assay of the A431 cell line evidenced that quercetin inhibited cell growth in relatively all doses (from 5µM to 1,000 µM), with the exception of the minimum concentration of 1 µM (where quercetin dramatically stimulated cell growth), and 25 µM (where quercetin also stimulated cell growth, but at a lower rate than at 1 µM). Note that the toxic effect of the compound under the conditions of this study is directly related to the amount of dose delivered. For this reason, this information should be considered when conducting future experiments that will seek to find more information about the topic. This study opens a wide field for future research, like studying the quercetin’s action mechanisms in the cell line used.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS

Obesity rates have increased and with it has also increased the rate of diseases. Manufacturers have taken advantage of the increase in the rates of obesity and diseases by launching many dietary supplements into the market. People pay close attention to these infomercials they see about dietary supplements and are curious to know if what they say is true. Two well-known dietary supplements were chosen to be compared, to see if they truly help the body to absorb fat. The hypothesis was that dietary supplements would absorb ingested fat and that supplement X would be more effective than supplement A. Ten milliliters of pepsin, starch, hydrochloric acid, lipase and used corn oil, were put in each of the nine glass bottles. Three groups made up of three glass bottles each were labeled as group A (which contained supplement A), group X (which contained supplement X) and as group C (which contained no supplement). Observations were recorded every ten minutes. After the first twenty minutes visible changes occurred in group X while in groups A and C nothing occurred. Visible changes in group A occurred after thirty minutes, while there were no changes in group C. After analyzing the collected data it was concluded that dietary supplements do help to absorb ingested fat and that supplement X was more effective than supplement A. The hypothesis was correct. Although dietary supplements help to absorb fat, it is recommended that people consult an expert.

EVALUATION OF MARGINING ALGORITHMS IN TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEMS FOR TUMOR VOLUMES TYPICAL OF STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY AND STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
Kelly McKenzie Carson
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Accuracy of radiation treatment planning systems is extremely important because such systems dictate the amount and location of radiotherapy a patient receives. I compared the margining algorithms, using computer generated tumor volume and actual spherical volume, in two commonly used treatment planning systems: Varian Eclipse (8.6) and iPlan Image (4.0). I used seven nylon thermoplastic spheres (phantom tumors) to simulate tumors with 2.4, 4.8, 9.5, 16.0, 25.0, 36.0, and 50.0 mm diameters. I also compared 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 matrix sizes and 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mm computed tomography (CT) slice thicknesses to see if these factors influenced the variability of the margining algorithms. I determined that the Eclipse and iPlan systems calculated significantly larger (α=0.05) than actual margined tumor volumes, with Eclipse tumor volumes being significantly larger than those calculated by iPlan. In the Eclipse system, significantly larger margined tumor volumes were calculated with larger slice thicknesses, but this trend was not evident with iPlan. This work highlights the apparent differences between planning systems in generating planning target volumes from gross tumor volumes, including differences due to CT slice thicknesses used as inputs into these systems. In clinical practice, treatment planning systems should be consistent in volume information provided to the user, especially in stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy where there is very little room for errors since these treatment techniques involve the administrations of large radiation doses to critical structures.

A NOVEL DISCOVERY: THALAMIC NEURODEGENERATION IN HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE
Bowei Deng
White Station High School, Memphis, TN

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by cortical and striatal neurodegeneration. Recent studies suggest that the thalamus may be another HD target in human cases. However, no evidence of thalamic neurodegeneration has been reported in HD mouse models. Using stereological methods, this study analyzed the volume of brain sections and found that cerebral cortex, striatum and thalamus showed 21%, 28%, and 31% decrease respectively in volume in R6/2 mice. Furthermore, a 33% parafascicular nucleus atrophy and 31% total neuron loss were detected in R6/2 mice. Quantitative analysis of confocal laser scanning microscope images of immunohistochemistry revealed that VGlut2(marker of thalamostriatal terminals) immunolabeling decreased significantly in striatum of Q140 knock-in mice, indicating loss of thalamostriatal fibers. The data provides strong evidence of thalamic neurodegeneration in HD mouse models.

STUDIES ON DRUG MICROENCAPSULATION: AN IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF AN IBUPROFEN AND CETYL ALCOHOL SYSTEM
Tony Huang
Francis Joseph Reitz High School, Evansville, IN

Ibuprofen, a hydrophobic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation, has had many shortcomings since it first hit the market. Like many other NSAIDs, it can cause GI irritation, has an ulcerogenic effect, and has a poor therapeutic half-life. Sustained-release microencapsulation can possibly eliminate these hindrances by encapsulating ibuprofen in a veneer of excipient which changes the nature of the drug’s release. Ibuprofen’s low melting point and hydrophobic nature make it most compatible with wax-based excipients. Thus, cetyl alcohol, an FDA approved food additive with a melting point of 49 - 50 deg. Celsius, was used in this study. The aim of the current study was to analyze how the experimental parameters varied in the melt-solidification technique applied previously affected the release profiles of the capsules. Ibuprofen and excipient were emulsified then rapidly cooled using a USP paddle or Teflon coated stirrer bar. Stirring rate and excipient ratios were systematically adjusted to attain desired capsule sizes. In vitro studies were conducted via spectroscopy at approximately 263.5 nm. Samples were withdrawn from microcapsules suspended in phosphate buffer (6.8 pH) at set time intervals and evaluated. Observed particle properties such as sphericity and size suggested successful microencapsulation in the majority of the melt variations. Stirring rate significantly altered the size and consequentially ibuprofen release. Release profiles showed relative success: encapsulated ibuprofen tended to release at a slower rate than non-encapsulated and varied most significantly with size discrepancies. The utilization of microcapsule size differences could potentially provide predictable sustained release dosage forms.

MAKING HEARTBEATS GO LOKO
Darby Kathryn Schumacher
Girls Preparatory School, Chattanooga, TN

This project was designed to find out the effect Four Loko has on the heart rate of Daphnia compared to alcohol, caffeine, an alcohol and caffeine solution, spring water, and sugar. The hypothesis was that the heart rate would rise when given caffeine, fall when given alcohol, and not change when given sugar. It was also predicted that when given an alcohol and caffeine mixture or Four Loko, the heart rate would increase because of the caffeine present, but not increase as much as the caffeine tests because of the depressing effect of the alcohol. The different substances were diluted and the testing was executed. To test, a Daphnia was put onto a Petri dish, covered by 2 drops of spring water and viewed under the microscope. The movement of the Daphnia was hindered by cottonball fibers. The heart rate of the Daphnia was counted in two 15-second intervals, then 2 drops of one of the different substances were added, a 5 minute interval was timed to allow the substance to have an effect on the Daphnia, and then the heart rate was counted again in two 15-second intervals. This process was repeated for each substance. The results of the testing showed that alcohol and caffeine both drastically altered the heart rate, decreasing it by 49% and increasing it by 54%, respectively. The sugar water and the alcohol and caffeine mixture both decreased the heart rate within 1.5% of the control heart rate, while the Four Loko decreased the heart rate by 37%. The data collected did not fully support the original hypothesis, but it did address the initial question of "What does Four Loko do to a Daphnia's heart rate compared to alcohol, caffeine, a combination of both, and sugar?"

CAFFEINE INDUCES APOPTOSIS AND AUGMENTS THE CYTOTOXICITY OF ANTI-CANCER DRUGS IN BAF3 CELLS
Meghana Sai Pagadala
Rivermont Collegiate, Bettendorf, IA

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is an aberrant bone marrow cancer. In an attempt to enhance the efficiency of chemotherapy in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, I attempted to explore the capability of caffeine to induce apoptosis and augment the cytotoxicity of current CML drugs (imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib). To explore these qualities, I treated BaF3 cells with varying concentrations of caffeine, CML drugs, and CML drug-caffeine combinations. Cell proliferation assays helped me determine final concentrations for treatment and the CaspACE and Hoechst Stain assays aided in gauging apoptotic function. The caspACE assays illustrated that caffeine at levels below 4 mM failed to induce a substantial frequency of apoptosis, and these cells probably were rooted in a stage of the cell cycle, most likely G1. Cells treated at caffeine concentrations of 8 mM had high percentage of apoptotic cells. When caffeine was combined with the anti-cancer drugs, caffeine seemed to synergistically stimulate the drugs’ effects at 24 hours; however, this effect seemed to fade into only an additive effect at 48 hours. If used in the future, caffeine dosages may need to be given every 24 hours to maintain a strong synergistic effect. From my data, I determined that “caffeine induces apoptosis and augments the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs in BaF3 cells.” Caffeine displayed some extraordinary effects that, with further testing, could be used in cancer treatment in the future.

Klein Oak High School, Spring, TX

To overcome the drawbacks of conventional treatment methods in treating chronic inflammation, the Transdermal Drug Delivery Method is looked at as a promising alternative. However, the Transdermal Drug Delivery Method cannot be applied for a large number of drugs because the skin is too good of a barrier. <br><br>Purpose of this project is to find out whether the bioavailability of Gingerol 6 (a natural alternative for NSAIDs) can be optimized using Transfersomes as a drug carrier Via Transdermal Drug Delivery in treating inflammatory diseases.<br><br>Different therapeutic compounds in Zingiber Officinale were evaluated through an in-silico approach and Gingerol 6 was identified as the most suitable drug that fulfills all the parameters of the Transdermal Drug Delivery Method. Gingerol 6 was extracted from Ginger and purified using flash column Chromatography. <br><br>Transfersomes were synthesized using phospholipids (Lecithin), solvents (Chloroform), and surfactants (Sodium Deoxycolate). Encapsulation efficiency of the Transfersomes was evaluated through the Entrapment Efficiency Analysis. <br><br>Next the permeation ability of Transfersomes was evaluated using a dialysis bag(as Skin) and Franz Diffusion Cell. The Optical Density values were determined at different time intervals using UV-Visible Digital Spectrophotometer. In the next phase the same procedure was followed, except an artificial skin construct was used. <br><br>Data collected in the different phases of this experiment confirmed that Transfersomes are an efficient drug carrier in delivering Gingerol 6 via the Transdermal Drug Delivery Method in treating Chronic Inflammation. This method can be extended in treating variety of other diseases.

SOFTWARE FOR FINDING A CATARACT ON A DIGITAL BITMAPPED IMAGE OF EYE
Olga Gavrina
Samara Medical-Technical Lyceum, Samara, RUSSIA

Eye dimness (cataract) is one of the most serious eye diseases nowadays. It reveals itself in changes in color perception and appearance of spots in the vision. It may gradually lead to loss of sight. The main danger of the disease is that conservative treatment can be effective only at an early stage when a person might not even realize that s/he is having the problem. That is why early diagnostics is necessary. Unfortu-nately, none of modern ways of diagnostics prove to convenient and user-friendly. <br><br>This study is based on the results of early research “Diagnostics of Eye Dimness Using Digital Photo Camera.” It has been proved that visual methods: digital photos with “red-eye” effect help distinguish between the eye with cataract and without it. However, vis-ual analysis only may lead to a mistake. To minimize it, it was decided to create a spe-cial computer program. The aim of the present work was to improve the analysis of the photos with “red-eye” effect by automation of this process. The designed software as-sisted collecting information on the way of what the cataract looks like on digital bit-mapped images. <br><br>The work of the program consists of several steps: deleting specks, normalization, searching for pupil, searching of pixels corresponding to the cataract, and calculating the percentage of “ill” pixels. The user can control some steps so that the results are more accurate. The estimation of calculation errors magnitude does not exceed 5%. The result of this study is a new way of early diagnostics that is user-friendly, conven-ient, and can be held even at home.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL MODEL FOR ASSESSING BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND FAILURE MECHANISMS OF VARIOUS SUTURE TECHNIQUES: IMPLICATIONS FOR WOUND DEHISCENCE
Arslan Arshad
The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Tissues under tension are prone to post-operative suture line failure leading to wound dehiscence – a condition with a mortality rate of 14-50%. To date, no study has been conducted to model, quantify, and analyze the biomechanics and failure mechanisms of various suture techniques theorized to be a significant contributor to this complication. In this study, a midway incision made on porcine dermal strips (35x90mm) was sutured using either a simple interrupted, running, or running-locking suture technique with 4-0 Vicryl suture. The specimens were mounted onto a mechanical testing device and pulled to failure at 1mm/s. A high speed video (HSV) recorder was used to capture the mechanism of suture line failure. Mechanical testing data was processed to determine ultimate tensile load, ultimate tensile stress, maximum tensile strain, tangent modulus, and extensibility. HSV was analyzed to characterize the precise mechanisms of suture line failure. The simple interrupted technique withstood the greatest load (142.42±11.35N, p=0.011), exhibited the least strain (0.202±0.0403, p=0.010), and experienced the highest stress (671.61±53.5MPa, p=0.016) across the suture line. HSV showed that sutures most often fail at the knot where the stresses are most concentrated. In conclusion, a novel model for ex vivo testing of suture techniques was successfully developed, and the biomechanical behavior of the most commonly used suture techniques was elucidated. The simple interrupted suture technique was found to be most mechanically stable and suture failure was traced to concentrated stresses in knots. The results may be used by physician researchers to further study suture biomechanics and to make more informed decisions during surgical procedures at high risk for wound dehiscence.

WHY DIABETICS NEED TO KNOW THE COMPLEXITIES OF CARBOHYDRATES
Aubrey Alexandra Jones
James W Mitchell High School, New Port Richey, FL

Should a diabetic adjust the amount of insulin needed when eating a simple carbohydrate such as cauliflower, versus a complex carbohydrate such as potato? Although food labels do not designate which carbohydrates make up food, some carbohydrates assimilate faster than others. This lab proves that although potatoes contain more carbohydrates, cauliflower has higher levels of glucose molecules, which are used immediately for fuel. A colorimetric method measured the glucose levels in potatoes and cauliflower. The chemical anthrone was added to both in separate cuvettes to get a shade of green, which was then measured for absorbency in the spectrophotometer. As proven by Beer’s Law, there is a linear relationship between the absorbency and concentration in a solution. This law allowed the use of a pure glucose solution baseline graph to calculate glucose values for potatoes and cauliflower. After the graph was constructed, results showed that cauliflower contained a higher level of glucose than potatoes. When .25 mL of the carbohydrate sample was tested for each substance, potatoes showed to contain an average of 4.80 micrograms of glucose, while cauliflower showed to contain 11.40 micrograms of glucose. Since potatoes are known to contain more carbohydrates than cauliflower, this paradox can be explained by the fact that potatoes are made up of more starch and cellulose than cauliflower, accounting for the rest of the carbohydrates. Therefore, if a diabetic considers the makeup of carbohydrates in a particular food, he or she may reduce the amount of insulin needed to process those carbohydrates.

TRAFFICKING CHITOSAN NANOPARTICLES IN HEPG2 CELLS
Thomas Mark Kuncewicz
DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

Despite immense efforts by researchers, no universal cure has been found for cancer—a terrible disease which over one and a half million people were diagnosed with in just this past year. Additionally, current cancer treatments involve collateral damage to the patient, which range from localized tissue death to far more complicated conditions, which may threaten the very life the treatment was intended to benefit. This project explores one of the most promising venues of cancer treatment—introduction of siRNA to cancer cells via chitosan nanoparticles, preventing expression of vital genes—essentially killing the cancer cells. In order to design a plan for cellular siRNA delivery, it is imperative to know how the chitosan-siRNA complex interacts with cellular processes during its entry and how the complex goes about reaching the cytoplasm, where the siRNA is able to perform gene-silencing. In order to properly track the movement of the nanoparticles, HepG2 cells were transfected with GTPases, which fluorescently marked different portions of the standard pathway of endocytosis. The validity of these markers was confirmed using bovine serum albumin and transferrin nanoparticles. From confocal imaging of chitosan-siRNA trafficking, I observed no colocalization of nanoparticles with early endosomes, and minimal colocalization with late endosomes. I began to devise theoretical explanations for this lack of colocalization, and the two most likely scenarios are that by the time I image the cells, the nanoparticles have already escaped the endosomes, or that the nanoparticles use a different, specific pathway to enter and interact with the cell.

EVALUATION OF TRANSDERMALLY DELIVERED ASPIRIN
Purnima Malik
Central York High School, York, PA

Medicating the body efficiently and safely is a challenge for pharmaceutical chemists in the design of transdermal drug delivery(TDD) systems. The stratum corneum regulates the materials that can be sent through the dermis into the bloodstream, allowing limited drugs and matrices to be used. In this three-year continuation project a monolithic matrix TDD patch composed of a novel Polyurethane adhesive and Acetylsalicylic acid(Aspirin) was formulated. Release experiments were conducted on porcine skin. Controlled and a sustained release, critical for curative effect is governed by several factors including the diffusion properties of the matrix, the skin, and drug concentration. The porcine skin was cleaned and treated with Trypsin solution, prior to sealing the TDD patch to the epidermis. The quantity of Aspirin released through porcine skin was determined by a series of timed extraction experiments. The aliquots were extracted from a homogenous sink solution systematically over 25 hours. Aspirin was quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Research shows that a significant amount of Aspirin must be released into the bloodstream for a therapeutic effect. Two theoretical models based on Fick’s law and Higuchi’s drug diffusion equations were used to analyze the results. Diffusion coefficients determined through regression analysis of experimental data by applying Higuchi’s time-dependent diffusion model, and planar release model were 3.7x10^-9 cm^2/sec and 2.7x10^-9 cm^2/sec. The experimentally determined diffusion rates demonstrate that therapeutic amount of Aspirin was released and that viable TDD patches can be constructed. Taking 75mg of Aspirin daily can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 25%, however the oral dosage can lead to GI bleeding.

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF A HIGH DIELECTRIC LIQUID, ETHANOL, ON THE RATE OF NEUROTRANSMISSION OF GRAY MATTER?
Mohan Sai Ravi, Dileep Karri, 
Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, FL

The purpose of this project was to examine the effect of adding a high dielectric strength liquid, ethanol, in a medium containing gray matter neuron tissue, more specifically, the basal ganglia from Lollingucula brevis. This was in an effort to increase neuro-transmission through the use of an artificial myelin source. It was hypothesized that if the concentration of the high dielectric strength liquid was increased, then the rate of impulse would also increase. In other words, there would be a decrease in the time delay between the initial pulse and the pulse transmitted through the neuron tissue. <br><br> To evaluate the hypothesis, a saline bath solution was set up with a cathode, anode, and grounded wire connected to the neuron tissue sample. A decameter was utilized to set the voltage at 472 millivolts and a pulse source was used to transmit a pulse into the basal ganglia tissue. The results from the experiment showed that an increase in the concentration of ethanol in the saline bath resulted in a significant increase in the rate of neuro-transmission. At 5% ethanol concentration, on average, the rate of transmission was 50 milliseconds faster than that of the control group. Thus, these results may introduce a new approach to demyelination disorders such as multiple sclerosis, by methods of artificial myelination using dielectric fluids that are nuerochemically stable - such as glycerol.

DEVELOPING PHAGE-BASED BIOMARKERS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Stephen Ryan Steinmetz, Andrei Terentiev, 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia in the population 65 and older with nearly 4 million Americans currently affected. With the continued improvement in health care the population over 65 is expected to rise significantly likely leading to increased numbers of those suffering from this disease. Although defined over 100 years ago by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, there is still no cure. Several drugs are available that have modest effects in some patients, however more promising drugs are being developed. One major confound in the process of developing new drugs is an inability to adequately identify at-risk or early stage AD cases. It is generally accepted that because the AD phenotype is recognized by family and clinicians after significant damage has occurred, that current drugs will have limited impact as they do not appear to address the underlying cause of disease. Therefore, there has been an increased interest in identifying biomarkers of disease progression in the CSF or blood of patients in order to identify those subjects that would benefit from early interventions. The current project has utilized phage display to identify targets within the CSF of AD and Control subjects that could potentially differentiate between these two groups. Our preliminary results show several promising phage sequences that selectively interact with elements within human control and AD CSF. Future studies will be carried out to screen the remaining samples, sequence the identified phage with the highest affinities, and attempt to identify the components with which the phage are interacting. This could allow for a rational approach

Vici High School, Vici, OK

The purpose of our experiment was to test which type of exercise between the Wii Fitness or Just Dance makes your heart rate increase more. We hypothesized that the Just Dance exercise would increase your heart rate more than the Wii Fitness. We decided to do this project because of all of the advertisements talking about how much better the Wii Fitness and the Just Dance were than jogging. We chose three test subjects from different age groups to jog for four minutes, play Wii Fitness, and Just dance twice each , with rest in between each exercise. Then we averaged the two heart rates together. Our data supported our hypothesis that the Wii Dance increased your heart rate 3 bpm more than the Wii Fitness. We discovered that the Wii Dancing hearrt rate is almost equivalent to the jogging for four minutes heart rate.

SILVER NANOPARTICLES: A POTENTIAL CURE FOR HUMAN BREAST CANCER
Samia Nawaz, Lillian Tong, Shanshan Hu
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Breast cancer is a formidable and common disease, and current cures such as radiation are harmful and costly. Nanotechnology, a growing field that involves the use of extremely small materials and has been used in the healthcare field, is a potential alternative to existing cures. Due to their size, nanoparticles are able to enter cells and tissues through methods such as inhalation or ingestion, which could be therapeutically beneficial. This project examined the effects of silver nanoparticles in different concentrations and time intervals on the morphology of MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cells. It is suggested that silver nanoparticles will negatively affect MCF-7 cells and their morphology, which could lead to new cancer treatments. After culturing, the cells were exposed to 5 or 10 μg/mL of silver nanoparticles for 24 or 48 hours. Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and light microscopy were then performed on all of the samples. These images were viewed in correlation to evaluate the nanoparticles’ effect on the cells. Under 24 hour conditions, the number of cell extensions and their length decreased with increasing concentrations with statistical significance, but cell area was unaffected. In contrast to 24 hours conditions, cell growth increased with no apparent correlation to increased concentration for any aspect under 48 hour conditions. Further analysis using light microscopy showed significant amounts of cell death in the 48 hour concentration as compared to the 24 hour group. This validates our hypothesis: with higher concentrations of silver nanoparticles comes more cell damage. Furthermore, SEM was better for observing individual cells, however, overall effects on cell colonies were best determined with the light microscope.

ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGUS METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE (ASCOMYCOTA: HYPOCREOMYCETIDAE) AS A TOOL FOR THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THE AEDES AEGYPTI (DIPTERA: CULICIDAE) MOSQUITO
Franklin Chacon-Huete, Dylan Andres Bartels-Mora, Juan Carlos Cambronero-Heinrichs
Colegio Cientifico - sede San Pedro, San Jose, COSTA RICA

The entomopathogenic properties of the M. anisopliae fungus were used on Ae. aegypti mosquito eggs (Rockefeller strain) as a strategy for the biological control of the organism. Several solutions containing different concentrations of the fungus were prepared for their implementation in bioassays. After performing three bioassays, the effect of the control agent solutions on the mosquito eggs was confirmed at two different temperatures. Reduced efficiency was observed in eclosion events in eggs in concentrations of 3,2 x 10^8 propagules/mL and 1 x 10^7 propagules/mL. Therefore, the use of an entomopathogenic fungus, particularly M. anisopliae, as a biological control, is an effective alternative to be taken into account among the strategies to control the mosquito. Other advantages are that it has a minimal impact on the environment and it is easily prepared at a low cost.

MEG STUDY OF THE DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
Xiao Zhu, Lawrence Kim, 
Troy High School, Troy, MI

The purpose of this study is to determine if the Default-mode Network, the network of the brain in resting state when not focused on a task, is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia based on the detection of magnetic signals in the brain by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging. <br><br> Ten patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and ten control subjects were studied. A ten minute resting state MEG brain scan was previously performed with eyes open for every patient. Data was now filtered at 3-50Hz. Then MEG Coherence analysis was performed to determine the cortical areas that interacted strongly within each frequency bin of 2Hz from 3-50Hz.<br><br> In the comparison between control and schizophrenia patients, our results showed statistically significant differences in several brain regions, specifically in the right and left sides of Brodmann’s Area (BA) 47, BA 9, BA 10 and the right side of BA 46 and BA 24. These areas of the brain are involved in language, memory, decision making, empathy, executive functions, and higher cognitive functions in humans.<br><br> Through these results, we discovered that several regions of interest were activated dissimiarly between schizophrenia patients and controls that are directly related to common symptoms of schizophrenia such as obsessive delusions, disordered thinking, and atypical emotional responses. The detection of these abnormalities in the DMN using MEG imaging analysis can provide a basis to quantitatively diagnose patients with schizophrenia. In addition, DMN MEG imaging can be implemented as a means to assess the effectiveness of schizophrenia treatment methods (drugs, transcrannial stimulation, surgery, etc.), thus providing an invaluable clinical tool for the evaluation of patient treatment progress.

3-DIMENSIONAL BIO-IMPRINTING OF PROTEINS AND VIRUSES
Kelsey Skyler McKenna, Alan Czemerinski, Tom Wang
South Side High School, Rockville Centre, NY

Rapid and accurate detection of proteins and pathogens is critical in medicine, allowing quick response and treatment. Current techniques require prolonged incubation and excessive laboratory equipment. Our research utilizes an easier method of detection, called molecular imprinting (MI). Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) coating gold-plated silicon wafers enable detection of macromolecules that are first imprinted onto the surface. The sensors are analyzed using a potentiometer.<br><br>This study optimizes biosensor selectivity. We facilitated differentiation between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, yielding a difference in potential change of 40-60 mV. Selectivity was partially accomplished with different PEGylated hemoglobins, exhibiting a 30-50 mV potential change. We successfully imprinted Influenza virus, establishing the first time MI has been successfully applied to virology.<br><br> Atomic Force Microscopy scans of the SAM on the wafer reveal it to be rough, with cavities measuring 23.5 nm compared to the 5.5 nm hemoglobin molecules. Rough silicon wafers prove to be as efficient as smooth silicon wafers for detection. This disproves the current 2-dimensional model of MI, in which the monolayer is flat and much shorter than the bio-macromolecules. We therefore propose a novel 3-dimensional SAM model, in which the monolayer surrounds the macromolecule.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF MICRORNAS IN THE REPAIR MECHANISMS OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS AFTER HEART ATTACK
Karthikeyan Ardhanareeswaran, Arjun Bhattacharya, 
William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, NC

Heart attack is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Loss of blood flow to the heart prevents oxygen and other nutrients from reaching it. The delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the heart after a infarction can reverse tissue damage and improve heart function. Furthermore, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt1) has been shown to repair the infarcted myocardium and normalize cardiac performance when overexpressed in MSCs. We examined the involvement of miRNAs, short regulatory oligonucleotides, in these MSCs. We tested whether cardiac-related miRNAs are differentially expressed in the presence of the Akt1 gene and/or hypoxia. We also considered if the transcripts coding for the novel paracrine factors secreted by Akt-MSCs either encode or are regulated by miRNAs. We found that miR-206 and miR-208a expression both increased under the presence of the Akt1 gene but decreased under hypoxia, whereas hypoxia resulted in downregulation of miR-206, miR-208a, miR-1, and miR-1-2-as. Finally, we noticed that miR-1 is a potential regulator of novel hypoxia-driven paracrine Factor 12. A complete understanding of the role of miRNAs in MSCs could lead to new possibilities in the development of effective therapies for heart repair.

A SEARCH FOR RELIABLE MOLECULAR CYTOGENETIC MARKERS OF PROSTATE CANCER PROGNOSIS
Alison Nicole Tradonsky, Tammy Rubin, 
San Diego Jewish Academy, San Diego, CA

There is no reliable test of prostate cancer prognosis. Most cases are treated even though more than 80% remain clinically insignificant and less than 3% are fatal. Screening PSA results in detection and overtreatment of millions of indolent cases. In 2010 in the USA 48 men were treated for each life saved at a cost of over $600 million. This study was designed to find a reliable test of prostate cancer prognosis at diagnosis to limit treatment, side effects and costs to aggressive cases. It is a retrospective evaluation of 240 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and comprehensive follow up. For each case paired cancer and benign tissue samples were made into tissue microarrays and stained with antibodies against protein products of 20 gene sequences. All traditional clinical and pathologic prognostic indicators and all antibody stains were assessed, recorded and correlated with patient outcomes in univariable analysis. Statistically significant prognosticators evaluable on biopsy and significant antibodies were evaluated for independently significant outcome predictability in multivariate analysis. Antibodies targeting Stathmin 1, E-Cadhedrin, Cytochrome p450-4z1 and Hey2 were significant by univariable analysis. By multivariable analysis Gleason score, Hey2 and Cytochrome p450-4z1 were independently predictive of outcome. Stathmin 1 and E-Cadherin were not independent of Gleason score but remain clinically useful as antibody interpretation is objective while Gleason score is subjective, and Gleason score on biopsy often differs from prostatectomy Gleason score. Stathmin 1, Cytochrome p450-4z1, E-Cadhedrin and Hey2 hold promise for a future reliable test of prostate cancer prognosis and therapeutic response.

Adiba Maisha Matin, Maira Malik, Rabab Iqbal
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

The effects of caloric restriction on oxidative stress were measured in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, muscle, brain, small intestines, and kidney from Rattus norvegicus. Tissues from three groups: control, food-restricted, and food restricted with Hind-Limb suspension were given to students for analysis. Then tissues were harvested and processed for the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker for oxidative stress in organs of subjects that had, in a previous experiment, been put on food restriction and food restriction with Hind-Limb Suspension. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford Assay. Results showed that oxidative stress (MDA/per milligram protein) was highest (P-value < 0.05) with food restricted and HLS rats in the heart, small intestines, liver, testis, and brain. In lungs and kidneys, oxidative stress per milligram protein was highest in the control. This data was significant between control and diet restricted and Hind-Limb Suspended animals. On most of the organs, data indicated that Hind-Limb Suspension induced more oxidative stress than normally experienced. Caloric restriction proved beneficial in the lungs, pancreas, testis, and brain. The hypothesis that caloric restriction will result in less oxidative stress during Hind-Limb Suspension was not supported. The tissues of food restricted and Hind-Limb Suspended subjects showed the most oxidative stress per milligram protein in seven of the nine organs tested. The study will have an impact on the role of dietary control on body weight regulation and oxidative stress and the decrease in the rate of denaturing of proteins caused by oxidative stress.

EFFICIENT GENERATION OF DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS FROM SKIN-DERIVED PRECURSORS: NOVEL AND AUTOLOGOUS TREATMENT FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Alexandre Lemieux, Mohamed Reda Bensaidane, 
Cegep de Sainte-Foy, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, CANADA

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 4 million people worldwide. It is characterized by movement disorders such as tremors and slowness of movement. These effects are caused by a lack of dopamine in the striatum, resulting from the death of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Since current treatments, such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), are inefficient, a new approach would be the replacement of these neurons via transplantation. Skin-derived precursors cells (SKPs) are multipotent stem cells that are found in hair follicle dermal cells. SKPs were extracted from human biopsy and were proliferated and differentiated into dopaminergic neurons with a differentiation medium. The differentiation lasted 21 days and results were taken at regular intervals. Cells were analysed by immunocytochemistry (IC), flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent essay (ELISA). The results confirmed the differentiation of the SKPs, given the presence of Neurofilament-M in the IC results and an increase in the presence of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) in flow cytometry results. Flow cytometry results also demonstrated a statistically significant presence of tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme that is necessary to the synthesis of dopamine. RT-PCR results showed that Nurr-1 was largely expressed from day 1 to day 14 of the differentiation. ELISA results revealed an increase in the concentration of dopamine and an increase in the presence of survival factors GDNF and BDNF. These results show promise in using the differentiation of SKPs as an autologous treatment for Parkinson’s disease.

ASSOCIATION OF ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA), ACID ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE (GAA), NOTCH2 AND LACTASE GENOTYPES OR SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) IN ADULT OBESITY
Angela Chen, Alexander Wong, 
Hunter College High School, New York, NY

Obesity is a health burden that affects 7% of the international adult population. Recently, studies have shown that genetics may play a role in determining whether a person is prone to becoming obese. Genetic variants such as Adenosine Deaminase (ADA), Acid Alpha Glucosidase (GAA), Notch2 and Lactase have the potential to be correlated to obesity because they have been previously associated with obesity-related health issues, such as diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether genotypes, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for genes ADA2, GAA2, Notch2 and Lac -22kb have higher frequency in adult obese patients. We genotyped approximately 300 patients for each of the four genetic variants, using polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme digest, and agarose gel electrophoresis to determine these genotypes. With the data obtained, we performed a chi square test to verify that the experimental versus the normal populations were significantly different. Based on our results, we concluded that because the two-tailed p-values for three genetic variants were less than 0.05, ADA, Notch2, and Lactase genotypes are correlated to obesity. The two-tailed p-value for GAA was greater than 0.05; this discrepancy can be attributed to a small sample size. To further discussion, the coding SNPs in this experiment are necessary for obesity research because of the fact that they can alter enzyme structure and enzymatic function in cleaving polysaccharides. We can potentially use the results obtained from this experiment in personalized medicine, detailing a proper method to combat obesity for each susceptible individual.

TREATMENT OF SIMULATED CANCER CELLS WITH COMPTON SCATTERING-PRODUCED SECONDARY RADIATION
Blake Marggraff, Matthew Feddersen, 
Acalanes High School, Lafayette, CA

The purpose of the experiment is, using intermediate energies of x-rays in combination with tin particles in close proximity to cells, the simulated cancer (yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) will be more effectively killed, demonstrating a technique for inexpensive cancer treatment.<br><br> The procedure is designed to measure the amount of cells that die after treatment. The cultures are divided into four sets: one with radiation and tin (A), one with tin (B), one control with neither (C), and one with radiation (D). The masses of the living cells in each culture and run will be determined before and after incubation and treatment. The process works as dead (apoptosized and blebbed) cell bodies become the same density as the .25% agar solution and can be poured off with the supernatant, leaving only the live cells.<br><br> Our data and calculations have revealed that in four distinct trials, treatment of "cancer" cells with tin and radiation is 17.9% more effective than irradiation alone, and is 18.7% more effective than no treatment. The tin alone had no negative impact on the cellular health.<br><br> From this data, we can conclude that the technique involving production of secondary radiation is a more effective, less expensive way to localize damage to eukaryotic cells all without raising the total amount of absorbed radiation. In addition to the more effective treatment and less radiation needed for the patient's treatment, the entire experimental design costs less than $100, and can theoretically be implemented in current treatment setups to augment the efficacy of existing radiation therapies.

DEPLETION OF PROGRANULIN (PGRN-1) INCREASES PHOSPHORYLATION AND INSOLUBILITY OF EXOGENOUS HUMAN TDP-43 IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS.
Joseph West Paul
Ponte Vedra High School, Ponte Vedra, FL

Ubiquitinated TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a pathological hallmark of the neurodegenerative diseases frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the gene encoding the secreted growth factor progranulin cause familial FTLD-TDP. Reduction in the expression of the progranulin gene in cell culture has been shown to mediate proteolytic cleavage of TDP-43. I intended to model this phenomenon in the nematode C. elegans through RNAi knockdown of the homologous worm progranulin gene (pgrn-1) in a transgenic worm strain expressing human TDP-43 (hTDP-43). While knockdown of the pgrn-1 gene did not prompt fragmentation of hTDP-43, the decreased expression of pgrn-1 induced an increase in insoluble hTDP-43 phosphorylated at the serine 409/410 site. Concomitant to the increase in phosphorylated TDP-43, the worms exhibited an increased motor deficit. Immunoreactive hTDP-43 phosphorylated at the S409/410 site was detected in the transgenic worms, irrespective of the level of pgrn-1. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which pgrn-1 controls processing of hTDP-43.

QTL ANALYSIS OF A DIABETIC MOUSE BACKCROSS
Lauren Nicole Reagin
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

There are 25.8 million people that have diabetes within the United States (ADA, 2011). Previous studies have shown a genetic link to this devastating disease. The main purpose of this experiment was to identify QTLs(quantitative trait loci) that have an effect on the phenotypes of diabetes and to make graphical models using computational biology (which involves mathematical approaches using the computer with genetic data) and a mouse model. The model selected was a New Zealand Obese Mouse(NZO) x Nonobese/Nondiabetic Mouse (NON) backcross as the dataset included a variety of phenotypes. The dataset was analyzed with a program called r/QTL to help establish the links between the genetics of the phenotypes. It was hypothesized that a correlation that could found between the phenotypes and QTLs found in the data set and a graphical model could be made. Using the results from the analysis, graphical models were made. One model is over the interaction between the fat pad traits, leptin, and the QTLs that are located on the specified chromosome. The second model is over body weight and the fat pad traits with their interactions with glucose and the QTLs that are located on the specified chromosomes. The third model combines both the first and second model to establish a relationship between obesity and diabetes, as well as 3 different QTLs. The last part was when candidate genes were found using the QTLs from the combined model. There was a total of 6 candidate genes found and 2 pre-existing diabesity QTLs.

IDENTIFYING NOVEL INHIBITORS OF DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 AS A TREATMENT FOR DNMT1 OVEREXPRESSION CAUSED TUMORS
Alexander William Forsyth
Episcopal School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

DNMT1 catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to cytosine, primarily on newly replicated DNA strands. However, DNMT1 overexpression has been shown to lead to hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene promoter regions which can thus silence tumor suppressing genes, allowing carcinogenesis. DNMT1 inhibition has been shown to impede this process and can even lead to re-expression of the aberrantly silenced genes. DNMT1 inhibitors currently in clinical use, like doxorubicin, are extremely toxic however. Using computer data about DNMT1 and over 67,000 small molecules, all designated as possible drug candidates, a molecular docking program was run to theoretically predict binding affinities for these molecules, lower being a more effective inhibitor; lowest from this experimentation was -9.7 kcal/mol. In order to substantiate the computational predictions, a laboratory DNMT inhibition assay was conducted, comparing eight predicted inhibitors to the currently used doxorubicin. The most effective inhibitor exhibited 3.05 times greater DNMT1 inhibition percent than doxorubicin, and in all, 5 experimental inhibitors were more effective than doxorubicin. This data strongly suggests that these inhibitors could be far more effective DNMT inhibitors, than doxorubicin, especially as a treatment because available toxicity data suggests that the experimental inhibitors are far less toxic than doxorubicin. In order to substantiate this, and develop these inhibitors as potential cancer treatments, further testing is needed; IC50 curves for the inhibitors need to generated, and experimentation in DNMT1 overexpression caused cancer tissue needs to be conducted, as the immediate next step in exploring these novel inhibitors.

AN ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT RESEARCH ON PROTECTION OF DUNG BEETLES IN CONTROLLING EPIDEMIC DISEASE IN AFFECTED AREAS OF SCHISTOSOME OF THE DONGTING LAKE OF CHINA
Lingwei Xu
Changjun Middle School, Changsha, Hu'nan, CHINA

China Dongting Lake wetland is a seriously infected area of schistosomiasis, which threatens the health of people and domestic animals, schistosome ovum is transmitted through excrement. The preventive methods used now are concentrated on eradicating oncomelania which can cut the transmition rate, potentially damaging the environment. So using ecological methods to manage excrement could be a new way of prevention.<br><br> My research explored the local dung beetle (Catharsius molossus Linnaeus) and its favorite food, the influence on the schistosome ovum when beetles eat or bury the infected excrement, whether beetles spread the ovum, the daily amount of food consumed by beetles, the number of beetles and amount of excrement in the wetland, and the influence on the beetle’s survival when the medicine used to eradicate the oncomelania is used. Here are the conclusions:<br><br> The dung beetle prefers fresh human and bovine infected humid excrement. After digestion the mortality rate of ovum is 96.6%. When the infected excrement is buried, this reduces the growth of schistosome. The surface of the beetle won’t support the ovum. It can eat and bury 300g of excrement a day, the number of beetles currently is not sufficient to consume all the excrement. The oncomelania eradicating medicine can kill the mature worm of the beetle.<br><br> My project provides an ecological and safe method, which utilizes beetles in controlling epidemic disease without harming the beetle population. Because by increasing the number of beetles, it reduces the transmition rate by managing the infected excrement.

MITOCHONDRIA & ALZHEIMER'S: MODULATING THE GCLC GENE TO MITIGATE REDOX STRESS AND ETC COMPLEX DYSFUNCTION
Lisa P. Michaels
Shepton High School, Plano, TX

Effective therapies have eluded Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for over a century. This novel multi-phased research project integrates the mitochondrial cascade theory with the amyloid cascade and oxidative stress theories of AD, and investigates the effectiveness of the<br><br>GCLc-Glutathione pathway in prevention and treatment of the disease.<br><br>A new Drosophila melanogaster model with pan-neuronal over-expression of GCLc gene in Alzheimer's model flies was created at the Home Lab. This Abeta42-GCLc Drosophila group was subjected to redox stress through sleep deprivation and compared with Abeta42 group. Natural yellow-white Drosophila was used as the positive control. The mitochondrial enzymatic activity of the Electron Transport Chains of the Drosophila groups were analyzed at a Genetics Lab using colorimetric enzymatic assays.<br><br>The results showed that the lifespans of Abeta42-GCLc Drosophila were significantly higher than Abeta42 flies, especially under redox stress. The Electron Transport Chain assays indicated that Abeta42-GCLc groups had improved mitochondrial enzyme activities in all<br><br>complexes, especially I, III and IV which are encoded by mtDNA. This suggests increased in vivo Glutathione synthesis in the Abeta42-GCLc Drosophila, and enhanced antioxidant protection of neuronal mitochondria from amyloid toxicity and neurodegeneration.<br><br>Affordable diagnostic tools could be developed using enzymatic levels in select mitochondrial complexes as biomarkers of AD. GCLc gene modulation through targeted gene therapies or epigenetic treatments to increase in vivo synthesis of Glutathione in neurons are potent research avenues.<br><br>These integrative efforts can contribute to the National Alzheimer’s Project and improve the lives of the 15 million Americans who are at risk of AD.

ALL CLEAR OF NUCLEAR? THE USE OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN COMBATING THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR RADIATION
Ahneesh Jayant Mohanty
R.C. Clark High School, Plano, TX

Can antioxidants be used to combat Nuclear Radiation?<br><br>In this experiment, starfish (Protoreastor nodosus) were used as their immune systems are very similar to a human’s and contain a large portion of the human genome. Four antioxidants were used: Curcumin, Astaxanthin, Vitamin C, and Glutathione. The starfish were exposed to 12 cGy of radiation by a proton therapy machine three times consecutively. A hydrophobic and hydrophilic antioxidant were injected into shrimp and fed to the starfish. After the last radiation dose, hemal samples were taken and coelomocyte counts were conducted. Next the starfish were dissected and the gonads were massed. Upon reviewing the data, a multi antioxidant formula was created by combining Astaxanthin, Glutathione, and Vitamin C, and tested against Potassium Iodide following the same procedure as before.<br><br>The results showed that the starfish with antioxidants had almost 7x more coelomocytes and their gonads massed 4x more than the starfish without antioxidants. In addition, the starfish with the multi antioxidant formula had almost 4x more coelomocytes and had gonads massing almost 5x more than the starfish with Potassium Iodide. As a result antioxidants can combat and heal potential damage to two main targets of nuclear radiation: white blood cells, reproductive cells and reproductive organs, unlike Potassium Iodide. Antioxidants offered a more complete barrier against nuclear radiation, possibly saving countless lives in the process.<br><br>The results clearly show that antioxidants have the ability to protect against Nuclear Radiation- even better than Potassium Iodide- the current safety measure against Nuclear Radiation.

CELLULAR THERAPY OF OVARIAN CANCER, YEAR TWO: IMPAIRED CYTOKINE-INDUCED CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF MONONUCLEAR CELLS FROM OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS AND UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD
Collin Randall Edwards
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Ovarian cancer usually presents at an advanced stage and is only transiently controlled by <br><br>surgery and chemotherapy in most women. Defective immune surveillance mechanisms <br><br>are thought to play a role in disease recurrence. We hypothesize that an <br><br>immunotherapeutic approach may be beneficial. Here, we use an established in vitro <br><br>model to measure cytotoxic killing of ovarian cancer cell lines by peripheral blood <br><br>mononuclear cells (PBMC) in combination with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and/or Interferon α- <br><br>2b (IFN α-2b). Using immunomagnetic bead selection, we demonstrated that purified T <br><br>cells are a significant component of the observed cytotoxic activity. However, allogeneic <br><br>transplantation of normal immune cells can cause a potentially fatal reaction. To <br><br>determine if active immune effector cells are present in alternative, potentially safer <br><br>sources, we tested PBMC from ovarian cancer patients and from umbilical cord blood for <br><br>cytotoxic activity under similar conditions. In the presence of IL-2 and IFN α-2b, neither <br><br>umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells nor ovarian cancer patients’ PBMC demonstrated <br><br>cytotoxic activity against the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3-AF2. Determining whether <br><br>there is an absence of effector cells or a presence of suppressor cells may allow for the <br><br>development of an effective immunotherapy against ovarian cancer.

GETTING CLOSER TO TREATING CANCER: USING FE-C NANOPARTICLES AND RF TO DELIVER ERLOTINIB AND DOX TO PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS
Maliha Bhatti
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

With the increasing number of cancer patients, more attention is directed to finding an effective and less harmful treatment; nanotechnology is advancing towards such a treatment. Iron-carbon (Fe-C) nanoparticles can perform two functions—carry drugs and induce heat. These functions are exercised when the Fe-C nanoparticles act as a drug delivery system to transport chemotherapy drugs, DOX and erlotinib, to the pancreatic cancer cells, and RF induces heat to the nanoparticles releasing the drugs and killing the cells. The amount of drug released by the nanoparticles and then the effect of the treatment on the cancer cells was found, DOX and the RF treatment were predicted to yield increased drug release and decreased pancreatic cancer cell viability compared to the use of Erlotinib and no RF treatment. To find the percent drug release, Fe-C nanoparticles were synthesized and the concentration of the drug released every hour from inside the dialysis bag was compared to the initial concentration. To analyze the effect of the drugs, nanoparticles, and RF treatment on the pancreatic cancer cells, twelve samples were prepared with the different conditions and then confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to observe the cell death. Because the DOX drug seemed to be the most effective in conjunction with the Fe-C nanoparticles and the RF treatment to kill the pancreatic cancer cells, this method could be applicable to treating cancer, although there is still more research and testing to be done before it can be used on humans.

VALIDATION OF A CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY SIMULATION; EVALUATING THE FIDELITY OF A MAGNETICALLY-GUIDED CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE
Francinie Zura Miranda
Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, FL

Medical simulations have come a long way in our generation. Surgeons and Medical doctors have used these simulations to help them get a real-life feel of what they are going to be getting into. It helps them practice and reproduce an actual surgery or procedure without actually performing it on a patient. Developing these simulations is not a very easy task. In fact, producing a simulation is not the only thing that goes into it. During the production phase, the simulation needs to go through a validation stage; which tests the simulation to see if the finished product will do what it’s designed for. In this paper I will layout the steps that I did to validate the simulation of the Capsule Endoscopy; that will potentially be used for training doctors to use the magnetically guided capsule endoscopy. My validation test will compare the qualitative and quantitative variables, as well as the capabilities of the simulation and see how accurate it is to the actual capsule endoscopy procedure. If the simulation passes the test, then it will meet my hypothesis that the simulation was well developed to potentially be used to give physicians a feel of the actual procedure.

ARTERIAL HEMODYNAMICS IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS PATIENTS, A MATHEMATICAL MODEL
Aprotim Cory Bhowmik
Parkview High School, Lilburn, GA

Being the leading cause of death in the United States, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) affects over sixteen million people, and over half a million people die from CAD every year. Most often, CAD begins with atherosclerosis, which is the build-up of plaque inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Atherosclerosis, which is also known as stenosis, reduces the effective diameter of the artery, increases blood pressure, and reduces blood flow. This condition often results in myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack) and/or death. In this research, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the dynamics of blood flow in coronary arteries affected by stenosis. The blood flow velocity (v) versus pressure gradient (dp) relationships simulated by the model exhibit excellent agreement with measured v-dp data in human coronary arteries with and without stenosis. Using this model, the flow rate (q) versus pressure gradient (dp) relationship can be determined by knowing the percent stenosis from an angiogram. This q-dp relationship can then be compared with that of a normal artery to assess the severity of the stenosis. The model can also be used to determine the percent diameter stenosis based on measured q-dp data. Results of model simulation indicate that the effectiveness of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stent implantation can be improved significantly by redesigning the commonly used stent configuration. Based on these results, the researcher has developed a novel stent design that has the potential to reduce the number of cases of post-stenting myocardial infarction.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CEREBELLAR PHENOTYPE IN MICE WITH MUTATED RREB1
Danielle Lyn Keahi
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

This research focused on a mutation in the Rreb1 (Ras-responsive element binding protein 1) gene in the NM3888 mouse strain that causes progressive Purkinje neuron loss and results in ataxia, the loss of coordination of movement. RREB1 in humans has been reported to be a transcription factor that binds to Ras-responsive elements (Thiagalingam, 1996). However, little is known about the function of Rreb1 in mice. A characterization of the phenotype caused by mutated Rreb1 may shed light on mechanisms for neurodegeneration. This mutation was studied through immunostaining of cerebellum tissue sections, northern blotting to detect mRNA transcripts, and western blotting for Rreb1 protein in wild type and mutant mice. The results of this study show that this mutation is novel in NM3888 mice, that there is a significant reduction of Rreb1 mRNA in mutant mice, that ubiquitin positive protein aggregates, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, are present in the dendrites of mutant Purkinje cells, that neuron death is possibly not caused by apoptosis, and that axon degeneration may begin as early as one month of age in mutant mice. These results collectively help to define the effects of the Rreb1 mutation and its implications in neurodegeneration.

CHEMOTAXIS IN PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM: A MODEL FOR THE EFFECTS OF CANCER PROGRESSION
Teisha Maree Coffield
Lone Star High School, Otis, CO

Antioxidants have been suggested as a weapon for the fight against cancer. However a recent study found an increased risk of prostate cancer for those who took vitamin E supplements (Klein, 2011). The purpose of this research was to examine the possible effects of the antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene on cell signaling using the slime mold Physarum polycelphalum as a cancer cell model. It was hypothesized Physaurm polycephalum will show a chemotactic response when exposed to vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta- carotene when in a supplement form and in a food form, because antioxidants interfere with the reactions of free radicals and cellular reproduction. P. polycephalum were cultured on a 1 by 1 cm filter paper square and placed in the middle of a petri dish. The right side of the petri dish had a 1 by 1 cm filter paper square that was soaked in distilled water and the left side had a piece of filter paper soaked in the test substance. These plates were observed approximately every hour for 63 hours. Growth rates were calculated. P. polycephalum grew towards the vitamin E at higher rates than the control. Blueberry at lower rates than the control. There was no growth for the cantaloupe, strawberry, or beta-carotene. On the control plates P. polycephalum grew towards the test side of the plate, and on the vitamin C plates moved along the mid line. The hypothesis was supported.<br><br>

CHANGES IN THE SIGNALING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF-1) AND THE INSULIN RECEPTOR (IR) IN THE STAGES OF PRE-DIABETES TO TYPE II DIABETES IN THE MOUSE KIDNEY TISSUE
Tiana Woods
North Point High School for Science, Technology, and Industry, Waldorf, MD

Receptor expression of the Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1) and the Insulin Receptor (IR) in the mouse kidney tissue was measured by measuring the signaling significance of active enzymes- in this case, PeNOS- through the process of thick ascending cell suspensions, western blotting, and electrophoresis.<br><br> A in vivo model has been created in which the IR is knocked out from the renal tubule (IRKO mice tissue). This is a genetic maneuver that leaves expression of the IGF-1 normal. It was determined whether or not there were changes in the signaling significance of IGF-1 and IR receptor expression to gain a better understanding of when the effectiveness of signaling of the IR began to fail in type II diabetes. This progression was modeled with environments of low, medium, and high levels of glucose: 0nM, 0.5nM, 5.0nM, and 50.0nM.<br><br> Based on tissue analysis, IGF-1 signaling decreased as expected and increased in the wild-type littermate mouse kidney tissue. In both tissues, IGF-1 signaling did decrease in the diabetic level of glucose (50.0 nm). These results were expected except the IGF-1 signaling was predicted to decrease in IRKO mice kidney tissue. Insulin signaling slightly increased in both kidney tissue and decreased in the diabetic level of glucose. Insulin signaling shouldn’t have increased IRKO mice kidney tissue as the insulin receptor is knocked out. Perhaps this was due to slight loading inconsistency. The decrease of IGF-1 signaling in IRKO mice and increase in the WT kindey showed that IGF-1 does have a relationship with the insulin receptor.

HOW INFLAMMATION IS LINKED TO PROSTATE CANCER (II): NOVEL MECHANISM AND SOLUTION TARGETING CANCER STEM CELLS
Diana T. Ruan
Bellaire High School, Bellaire, TX

Understanding the target molecules and cells involved in mediating inflammation linked to prostate cancer growth, recurrence, and metastasis is a key step toward developing novel treatment against prostate cancer, a leading killer in U.S. In this study, a single “seed” human prostate cancer cell was successfully isolated from the cancer mass and cultured into a monoclonal cell line. The cell line, identified as a prostate cancer stem cell (CSC), expressed all three stem cell markers, CD133, CD44, and alpha2beta1 integrin. That inflammatory PGE2-producing enzymes and receptors were expressed differently in the CSCs compared to other cancer cells was further identified. The excessive PGE2 up-regulating the CSC growth and increasing CSC marker expression (implying an increase in the malignancy of the tumor and subsequent drug resistance, cancer recurrence, and metastasis of the cancer) were first found by a quantitative PGE2 assay and a unique mimicked endogenous inflammatory environment assay. Furthermore, one (EP1) of the four subtype PGE2 receptors (EP1~4) was shown to dominate the inflammatory PGE2 signaling in the CSCs. This is the first clear demonstration of how inflammatory PGE2 is involved in up-regulating prostate CSC growth and malignancy. In addition, the generated prostate CSC line and identified PGE2-synthesizing enzymes and EP1 receptor could be the target molecules for finding novel anti-prostate CSC drugs to block the inflammation linked to prostate cancer and/or to reduce the cancer malignancy, lowering the risk of prostate cancer recurrence and metastasis.

If Real-Time Neurofeedback fMRI of the primary motor cortex (M1), is compared to Standard fMRI, then mean activation will be greater and the coefficient of variation lower among subjects in Standard fMRI comparatively.<br><br>Ten de-identified volunteers underwent a Standard fMRI and Real-Time fMRI with an alternating finger tapping task focusing on the primary motor cortex. Standard fMRI required tapping the fingers of the right hand followed by rest. Neurofeedback required a short training period, followed by "visualization" of tapping the fingers without executing the task, while subjects viewed a graph of their progress of raising and lowering their activation levels in the primary motor cortex. Data sets were accessed and calculated for brain activation. Data was assigned to a standard space for anatomic standardization. MATLAB was used to create a new computer program allowing a standard deviation image to be produced. The mean was obtained and processed. Sample standard deviation was calculated. These steps were performed first for Standard fMRI then repeated for Real-Time Neurofeedback fMRI data. The maximum mean voxel was located for the primary motor cortex for each data set. Coefficient of variation for Standard fMRI versus Real-Time Neurofeedback fMRI data was calculated. Data was inserted into Excel, and graphs were generated.<br><br>The hypothesis was correct. Coefficient of variation was lower and mean activation was greater in Standard fMRI comparatively. The primary motor cortex demonstrated robust activation in the Standard fMRI group, but significantly less in Real-Time Neurofeedback fMRI.<br><br>This project may benefit society by advancing insight into Real-Time Neurofeedback fMRI and applying it to train subjects to modulate and control abnormal brain regions.

THE EFFECT OF ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE ON FEMALE KNEE LAXITY
Grace Elizabeth Mammarella
Columbia River High School, Vancouver, WA

Knee injuries in women have recently become a major topic of research. Research has been found to support that an increase in progesterone and estrogen can possibly weaken the collagen that makes up knee ligaments to increase knee laxity. An increase in knee laxity leads to a greater likelihood of stretched or torn ligaments. In this investigation, I will test the effect of progesterone and estrogen on four of the major ligaments in the knee. I tested the knee ligament laxity of 10 female subjects with similar athletic activities during four critical times throughout their menstrual cycle. Data was received through a manual test of each patient’s knee mobility range, which tests the laxity of each of the four main ligaments. These measurements were quantified with a homemade device. Surveys were used to find what day of their menstrual cycle each subject was on. Hormone level was estimated by day of menstrual cycle based off a chart depicting the average hormone level throughout the menstrual cycle. The ACL and PCL laxity proved to be most affected by female sex hormone levels, but other ligaments showed slightly less significant directly proportional relationships between hormone level and knee laxity. Almost all testing reveals an overall increase in knee ligament laxity during ovulation. Although not statistically significant, these data trends can be used to inform female athletes to be more aware of increased risk of injury and even to take precautions when participating in athletic activity during ovulation.

CAN CHITOSAN EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GENES TO ORGANS FOR GENE THERAPY?
Rachita Das
C. Leon King High School, Tampa, FL

Gene therapy is a technique for correcting abnormal genes responsible for disease development. In this process a "normal" gene is inserted into the genome (transfection) to replace an "abnormal" disease-causing gene. The challenge lies in finding an effective method of delivering the normal gene to the organs of the body where the abnormal genes are present. Most commonly used and traditional gene delivery agents are deactivated viruses or non-viral materials such as lipid substances able to bind DNA and cross the cell membranes. Lipofectamine (a non-viral agent) is the most widely used commercially available gene delivery vehicle, especially for in vitro studies. However, the toxicity of this compound limits its use in the in vivo gene delivery. <br><br> In this research, I have tested a non-viral, non-toxic gene carriers, named Chitosan, obtained from the shells of shrimps and other sea crustaceans, which is a non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide. I also tested a combination of chitosan and lipofectamine, named Chlipid, as a carrier. <br><br> Though my in-vitro experiments showed chitosan to be an effective gene carrier, in-vivo experimental results did not corroborate that. Chitosan alone was not able to deliver the td tomato plasmid gene to a noticeable extent. However, chlipid (chitosan when combined with lipofectamine) was able to attain a significant amount of transfection. In chlipid, the chitosan molecules shrouds the toxic lipofectamine molecules, making it somewhat nontoxic. My future in-vivo research will explore gene delivery efficiency of chlipid to other organs of the body and assess the level of toxicity, if any, in the body from prolonged use of chlipid in gene therapy.

THE EFFECTS OF GANODERMA LUCIDUM AND SPIRULINA PLATENSIS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF RAT ADRENAL PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA CELLS
Kayla Elizabeth Sherman
Sterling High School, Sterling, CO

The purpose of the research project was to test the effect of Ganoderma lucidum and Spirulina platensis on the growth of PC12 rat cells. The cells were grown in culture medium and washed with a surfactant to detach cells from the flask. Three solutions were prepared. Based on average human and rat mass, 0.033 g of Ganoderma lucidum was added to 100 mL of distilled water. For the same reason 0.133 g of Spirulina platensis was added to 100 mL of distilled water. 1 mL of each of these solutions was added to a solution of PC12 cells. The last solution was the control. The solutions were incubated at 37° C for 24 hours and then the concentration of cells per millimeter was found using a hemocytometer. The researcher cannot link either Ganoderma lucidum or Spirulina platensis to significantly affect the proliferation of the PC12 cells. The average concentration of PC12 cells in the control was 150,000 cells/mL. The average concentration of cells in the solution which was treated with Ganoderma lucidum was 289,166.67 cells/mL which was higher than the control. The average concentration of cells in the solution treated with Spirulina platensis was slightly less than the control, at 149,166.67 cells/mL. However, analyzing the data collected from the three trials, the researcher found that the cell concentration varied greatly in each different trial regardless of the treatment used. Additional research needs to be done to determine the effects of Ganoderma lucidum and Spirulina platensis.

CURCUMIN AS A CANDIDATE THERAPY FOR HIV-1 INFECTION, YEAR II
Anand Shahi Ahuja
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Curcumin is the active anti-inflammatory ingredient in turmeric, an Indian spice. Inflammation is a key mediator of HIV-AIDS. CCR5 is the major HIV co-receptor and is expressed mainly on T-cells. CCR5 expression increases upon inflammation and high levels of CCR5 associates with increased HIV-AIDS susceptibility. It was hypothesized that curcumin will decrease CCR5 expression levels through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: by decreasing NF-kB, a family of transcription factors for many proteins/receptors including CCR5, decreasing inflammation (T-cell activation), inducing CCR5 gene silencing via increased DNA methylation of its regulatory regions, or by increasing levels of CCR5 ligands. To test this hypothesis, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were subjected to in vitro T-cell activation in the presence/absence of curcumin. Levels of T-cell activation, DNA methylation of CCR5, CCR5 expression, and cytokines/chemokines were analyzed. Preliminary studies in Year 1 suggested that curcumin decreased CCR5 levels. These were confirmed in this year. Analyses of 8 donors showed that curcumin profoundly reduced CCR5 expression on T-cells. Curcumin also decreased levels of T-cell activation. Curcumin had minimal effects on the DNA methylation of CCR5. Also, it decreases NF-kB levels, as observed this year by the decrease in proteins associated with NF-kB. However, curcumin increased levels of CCR5 ligands (RANTES and MIP-1a) that are known to downregulate CCR5 expression and suppress HIV replication. In conclusion, this year’s studies showed by reducing inflammation, reducing NF-kB and inducing secretion of CCR5 ligands, curcumin downregulates CCR5 surface expression. Consequently, curcumin, a natural substance, may have utility in anti-HIV treatment.

TARGETING PELP1 SIGNALING IN GLIOBLASTOMAS
Peyton Elizabeth Bluhm
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

The goal of this study was to determine the role and mechanism of PELP1 in glioblastomas. The drug TK11 (synthesized to mimic the amino acids that PELP1 uses to bind to various nuclear receptors) was expected to block PELP1 signaling and inhibit cell proliferation. Glioblastomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors, affecting more than 22,500 people every year in the US population. Despite tremendous improvements in standard therapies (surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy), the maximum survival of glioblastoma patients remains to be ~12-14 months. There is an urgent need to find new therapies for this very deadly tumor. PELP1 (Proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1) is a proto-oncogene, whose expression is up regulated in hormonal driven cancers, including breast and ovary. In breast cancer cells, PELP1 increases cell proliferation by acting as co-activator for nuclear receptors such as Estrogen Receptor α (ERα). However, the role of PELP1 in glioblastomas is unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis of glioblastoma tissue arrays showed that PELP1 is up regulated in glioblastomas and correlated with the glioblastoma malignancy. Knockdown of PELP1 in glioblastoma cells reduced the proliferation. MTT based proliferation assays revealed that TK11 inhibited the proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Reporter gene assays showed that TK11 reduces the reporter gene activation of PR and NR1D1 by blocking PELP1 interaction. In conclusion, completion of these studies established the significance of PELP1 in glioblastomas and its possible target TK11 can be used for treating glioblastomas.

West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

Cell apoptosis, caused by oxidative stress, is an important step leading to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema are forms of COPD. This project explores natural antioxidants that can help inhibit apoptosis, preventing oxidative lung damage that leads to COPD.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to find out which of the Ocimum genus species - Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum gratissimum, and Ocimum tenuiflorum - exhibits the most antioxidant properties by inhibiting apoptosis, due to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 in MRC-5 cells.<br><br>Copper reducing equivalents (CRE) of the Ocimum genus species were determined. CRE is directly proportional to the total antioxidant capacity. The average CRE of O.tenuiflorum (16,229 µM) was the highest, the second highest was that of O.basilicum (15,207µM) and the least was that of O.gratissimum (14,876 µM).<br><br>MRC-5 cell lines treated with various concentrations of H2O2, ranging from 450 µM to 0 µM, were incubated for 45 hours. Trypan Blue staining and microscopic counting of dead cells led to the median lethal dose of H2O2 as 100 µM. MRC-5 cells were pre-treated with the individual Ocimum genus infusions, incubated for 60 hours, then treated with 100 µM H2O2 concentration, and incubated for 22 hours. <br><br>The ANOVA test showed that the average percentage of viable cells was significantly different among the herbal groups: O.tenuiflorum (90.25%), O.gratissimum (75.49%), and O.basilicum (74.28%). <br><br>The two tailed p-value tests showed that O.tenuiflorum inhibited apoptosis significantly more than the other two species. O.gratissimum and O.basilicum inhibited apoptosis in similar measure.

A NOVEL IMMUNOSTIMULATING (1,4)-ALPHA-D-GLUCAN FROM TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA FOR CANCER THERAPY
Renuka Ramchandran
John A. Ferguson Senior High School, Miami, FL

Immunostimulating natural products, especially those activating T cytotoxic cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages would be highly useful for biodefense and therapeutic management of pathogenic infections and cancer. Tinospora cordifolia is an immunostimulating herb commonly used in ayurvedic preparations for enhancing the immune system and the body’s resistance against infections. Based on this ethnobotanical data, a novel polysaccharide, (1,4)-alpha-D-glucan, was isolated and characterized from the T.cordifolia stem. In the present study, the effect of this novel compound on the activation of innate immune system was evaluated in human lymphocyte subsets. (1,4)-alpha-D-glucan is not cytotoxic to normal lymphoyctes and tumor cells and activates T-cytotoxic cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages which in turn contribute to the enhanced killing of cancer cells in vitro. This novel polysaccharide signals through the toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) leading to the activation of NF-kB pathway for the synthesis of cytokines. The cytokine profile showed an increase in the ratio of anti-inflammatory cytokines versus pro-inflammatory cytokines in the treated lymphocytes compared to untreated cells. These results suggest that (1,4)-alpha-D glucan isolated from Tinospora cordifolia has immunotherapeutic properties and could be used for therapeutic management of human cancers which works through the activation of the immune system.

SYNTHETIC NANOPARTICLE-BASED NANOZYMES FOR PANCREATIC CANCER THERAPY
David D. Liu
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US. Survivin is a cellular protein that is overexpressed in cancer cells. This is because survivin protects cancer cells from apoptosis.<br><br> The objective of my experiment was to degrade survivin mRNA in pancreatic cancer cells. In human cells, RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) locates and degrades specific mRNA sequences—it is a major component of gene regulation. I used RISC as a blueprint to design a nanozyme, which is a survivin mRNA anti-codon sequence and RNase attached to a gold nanoparticle. The anticodon sequence targets survivin mRNA, while the RNase cleaves the mRNA sequence at that site, thereby inhibiting survivin expression.<br><br> Overall, my project involved:<br><br>1. Synthesizing nanoyzmes by attaching cDNA and RNase to a 5µm gold nanoparticle.<br><br>2. Assessing the therapeutic effects of nanozymes in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 by using MTT assays, Western Blotting, and Hoescht staining.<br><br>3. Developing a model with differential equations to predict the effect of nanozymes in vivio. <br><br> Quantitatively, the MTT assay showed about a 50% reduction in cell number, with a p-value of 0 by an ANOVA test. The Western blot showed caspase (an apoptotic protein) expression, and the Hoescht stain showed visual proof of apoptotic cells.<br><br> My model (which was developed using my own data and nanoparticle filtration data from literature) predicted that a tumor could be reduced by half in 2.7 years by using 0.0125mL of 2.5µM nanozymne daily. Toxicity effects would be minimal, with only 1g accumulated in this time period. Gold’s inertness further reduces toxicity concerns. <br><br> Nanozymes have huge potential—I could construct them to treat any disease caused by gene overexpression. They could be used as drugs or in combination therapy.

DIABETES: A RISING EPIDEMIC? OR CAN IT BE CONTROLLED? TO STUDY THE HYPOGLYCEMIC, HYPOTENSIVE, AND HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIC EFFECTS OF GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE CAPSULES ON NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC HUMAN SUBJECTS AND ITS ROLE IN THE PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Soiba Khalid Mansoor

Millions of people around the world suffer from diabetes. In this disease, the body does not produce or properly use insulin and is marked by high blood sugars. Diabetes leads to high blood pressure and cholesterol, which further leads to complications like cardiovascular disease. Gymnema Sylvestre has long been used as folk remedy to treat diabetes. It contains several anti diabetic compounds, which help in controlling the disease. It contains gymnemic acid, which suppresses sweet taste receptors and stimulate insulin secretion in the pancreas. Gymnema Sylvestre is also rich in special amino acid called citrulline, which is found to lower blood pressure. Its high fiber content and other active compounds like triterpenoids help in lowering blood cholesterol.<br><br>Data was obtained from my mentor's study, which was conducted to see if 400 mg (200 mg/ twice a day) of Gymnema Sylvestre capsules would help in lowering blood sugar, blood pressure and blood cholesterol. <br><br>Data was statistically analyzed. The readings were tabulated according to the Gymnema Sylvestre supplemented group, the placebo group, and the control group. The average mean readings for blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol was calculated. Percentage drop or rise in readings was noted.<br><br>It was concluded that the oral ingestion of Gymnema Sylvestre showed a hypoglycemic, hypotensive and hypocholestremic effect on diabetic subjects and could safely be used as a dietary supplement for type II diabetes. Its regular consumption can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.

A SCREEN FOR GENES THAT MAY PLAY A ROLE IN MOTOR AXON GUIDANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Sarah Christine Forcier
Hathaway Brown, Shaker Heights, OH

The mechanisms of motor axon guidance are an important question in neurobiology because they contribute to the knowledge of the nervous system and can have applications in therapeutic approaches to developmental disorders and nerve regeneration. To investigate genes that may play roles motor axon guidance, Drosophila melanogaster were used because they are small, reproduce quickly and abundantly, have only four chromosomes, and are incredibly genetically amenable. For this study, a library of 206 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic Drosophila lines were crossed to flies carrying a neuronal driver, sca-GAL4, and UAS-Dicer. In the RNAi pathway, Dicer cleaves the double-stranded RNA, creating interfering RNA that bind and cleave target mRNA, rendering it incapable of performing its normal function. Thus, it is hypothesized that the knockdown of gene expression through RNAi may identify genes that may play a role in motor axon guidance by variations from the wild-type phenotype. The embryonic progeny were fixed in formaldehyde, stained with an antibody specific to motor neurons, and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Of the 206 fly lines screened, 19 fly lines, representing previously uncharacterized genes, had mutant phenotypes in the intersegmental nerve, thus indicating that these genes most likely play a role in guidance.

A NOVEL PAPER SENSOR FOR THE DETECTION OF PANCREATIC CANCER
Jack Thomas Andraka
North County High School, Glen Burnie, MD

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate of 5.5%. One reason for this is the lack of a rapid, sensitive, inexpensive screening method.<br><br>A novel paper sensor is described that simply, rapidly and inexpensively screens for pancreatic cancer.<br><br>Mia Paca cells overexpressing mesothelin, a biomarker for pancreatic cancer, were cultured; mesothelin was isolated, concentrated and quantified with ELISA. After optimization with the Western Blot assay, the antibody to human mesothelin was dispersed with single walled carbon nanotubes. This dispersion was used to dip-coat strips of filter paper, rendering the paper conductive. Optimal layering was determined using a scanning electron microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was applied to the paper biosensor. Change in electrical potential was measured before and after application and a dose-response curve was constructed with an R2 value of 99.92%. In vivo tests on human blood serum obtained from healthy people and patients with chronic pancreatitis, PanIn, pancreatic cancer revealed the same trends..<br><br>The sensor’s limit of detection was found to be 0.156 ng/mL, satisfying the limit of 10 ng/mL, the level considered an overexpression of mesothelin consistent with pancreatic cancer. <br><br>The sensor costs $3.00; 10 tests can be performed per strip. A test takes 5 minutes and is 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than ELISA, 25% to 50% more accurate than the CA10-9 test and is a sensitive, accurate, inexpensive, and rapid screening tool to detect mesothelin, a biomarker for pancreatic cancer.<br><br>

MUSTARD SEEDS: A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO COLON CANCER
Shivani Bafna
Solon High School, Solon, OH

Epidemiological evidence indicates that Brassica vegetables protect against colorectal cancer. Brassicas contain glucosinolates whose breakdown products exert antiproliferative effects against cancer cells. Allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), a major breakdown product of the glucosinolate sinigrin, is a constituent of mustard seeds and certain vegetables found in human diet. AITC was tested for antitumorigenic effects in HT29-19A and HCT116 human colon cancer cells in vitro. HT29-19A and HCT116 colorectal cells were exposed to AITC for 24 hours, and the number of adherent and detached cells was determined. Both cell lines were analyzed for cell-cycle characteristics by light and electron microscopy and were found to have features of apoptosis and mitosis. Evidence of apoptosis was also determined by crystal-violet staining in the detached population of cells. The effects on the proliferation and death of colorectal cancer cells were also examined from the MTS assays. DNA assays were also performed to determine the effects of various doses of AITC. The LD50, or most ideal dose, was determined to be a concentration of 0.0625 mM AITC. Given the results of increased sensitivity of the cells to AITC, it appears that this compound may protect against the development of colorectal cancer by selectively inhibiting the growth of the transformed cells.

KILLCAPS IV: CAPSAICIN AS A DEACTIVATOR OF CANCER CELL ACTIVITY
Randy Lee Baca
Taos High School, Taos, NM

According to the American Cancer Society, over 550,000 Americans die per year of different cancers. Four years ago, this project began with the intent to discover which chile peppers had the most capsaicin, and if there were ways to stress the chiles to produce a higher capsaicin level. In theory the higher amount of capsaicin has a significant impact on cellular structures of cancer. Also, the capsaicin would deactivate lung carcinoma rather than destroying or leaving cells open for propagation. The purpose of this project was to determine if increasing capsaicin concentrations would deactivate the cell activity of Lung Carcinoma cells and tumors. <br><br> The Capsaicin was obtained from different chiles including Bhut Jolokia that were subjected to different temperature stresses to induce capsaicin concentration increase. The alcohol was evaporated from these solutions. The Carcinoma cells were then flooded and injected with the differing capsaicin solutions and monitored with an inverted microscope. The cells were re-incubated to determine if cell doubling or activity would resume once placed back in a 37oC environment.<br><br> The highest capsaicin concentrations had the most significant and immediate impact on the cells and tumors. Once capsaicin was flooded onto the cell and tumors, they were disintegrated by lower level capsaicin, indicating apoptosis and anti-tumorigenic activity. There was minimal impact to healthy cells, although there was evidence of disruption to the cell wall. Lower capsaicin concentrations deactivated cancer cell activity, though the time of disintegration increased.

DISCOVERY OF A MOLECULAR TARGET OF VITAMIN E DELTA-TOCOTRIENOL IN HUMAN PANCREATIC CANCER
Samra Kazim
Tampa Bay Technical High School, Tampa, FL

a) Purpose of the experiment: The purpose of the experiment is to investigate the molecular target of vitamin E delta-tocotrienol in human pancreatic cancer. <br><br>b) Procedure: Human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2 and human pancreatic normal epithelial cells HPNE were grown in DMEM and M3F base culture media. The cells were treated with delta-tocotrienol and delta-tocopherol (10-100 µM), incubated, harvested and counted using trypan blue, cell growth by MTT and soft agar assay. Mia PaCa-2 cell lysate in RIPA buffer was prepared and given to Proteomics Core for protein binding. Binding of biotin-labeled delta-tocotrienol to human cellular apoptosis susceptibility (hCAS) protein was confirmed using streptavidin-beads. Mia PaCa-2 cells were transfected with hCAS SiRNA/control SiRNA and analyzed for cell growth and apoptosis. Proteins separated by electrophoresis and bands on membranes were treated with primary antibodies followed by secondary HRP conjugated antibody. Membrane was treated with luminol and hydrogen peroxide, exposed to film, developed and scanned. <br><br>c) Data: Delta-tocotrienol but not delta-tocopherol inhibited cell growth and induced cell death in human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells without affecting normal HPNE cells. Affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry and Western data show that delta-tocotrienol specifically binds to hCAS protein. hCAS knock down using SiRNA in MiaPaCa-2 cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth, and induction of cell death compared to control SiRNA. <br><br>d) Conclusions: Vitamin E delta-tocotrienol targets human cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (hCAS) leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells and warrants its use in the clinic.

DO NOVEL PROTEIN KINASE C ISOFORMS MEDIATE LIPID-INDUCED BETA CELL DYSFUNCTION?
Sachith Gullapalli
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, VA

This experiment explored the model of lipotoxicity, which holds that the symptoms of diabetes result from excess levels of fatty acids. It was hypothesized that lipid-induced beta cell dysfunction is a manifestation of insulin resistance in the pancreas, caused by the activation of novel protein kinase C isoforms. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the signaling protein Epac regulates cross-talk between the cAMP and PKC pathways. It was thought that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which potentiates insulin secretion in beta cells, might also trigger a pathway eventually leading to the activation of novel PKC isoforms. Mouse insulinoma cells were cultured in normal or palmitic acid enriched media. Cells were treated with a pan-PKC inhibitor (BIS-2), an insulin mimetic (INS-2), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), or an Epac inhibitor (BFA). The cells were challenged with exposure to either sub-stimulatory or stimulatory concentrations of glucose. An ELISA quantified insulin production, relative to total protein concentration (measured with a Bradford assay). BIS-2 significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in palmitic acid treated cells, indicating that PKC plays a significant role in mediating beta cell dysfunction. INS-2 dramatically increased insulin secretion in both normal and palmitic acid treated cells, suggesting that a positive feedback loop exists for insulin secretion. Additionally, Epac appears to down-regulate insulin secretion, this effect being more marked at sub-stimulatory concentrations of glucose. This suggests that Epac may play a role in preventing hypoglycemia by preventing insulin from being secreted when glucose levels are low. GLP-1 data had to be discarded because of degraded stock.

THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF MOBILE PHONE RADIATION ON THE REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Alyssa Benavides
J.W. Nixon High School, Laredo, TX

Electromagnetic Radiation from common GSM (Global System for Mobile Telecommunications) mobile phones with a carrier frequency of 850-1900MHz has been reported to cause many biological effects on whole organisms. The aim of this project would be to confirm if a non-modulated GSM field from an iPhone 3GS will affect the reproductive capacity, of the Drosophila melanogaster? My hypothesis was that by using an ANOVA two factor with replication test, it will show that the probability of the mean oviposition differs between the exposed and the non-exposed group in relation to its distance from the antenna.<br><br>Drosophila melanogaster is the test subject of this experiment, due to the fact that it is a well-studied organism in science. To test the hypothesis the Drosophila melanogaster was radiated/non radiated at eight different distances in order to collect the mean number of pupae in each test vial. The mean deviation from non-radiated group at 0 cm distance from the antenna was -36.34% and this difference decreased as the distance increased. According to the two factor ANOVA test, my results showed that the interaction between radiated/non radiated in relation to its distance did significantly differ (p‹10-29), meaning that the effects on reproductive capacity is not due to random variations. The statistical analysis also shows the probability that the reproductive capacity differs between radiated/non radiated, due to random variations was negligible (p‹2X10-61).The contributions of this project are twofold. First, the mobile phone radiation does have a significant effect on the Drosophila melanogaster reproductive capacity. Secondly, the distances of the mobile phone also play a significant role on the impact the radiation has on reproductive capacity.

4-1BBL: A POTENT ADJUVANT FOR THERAPEUTIC CANCER VACCINES
Jenci Lyn Hawthorne
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Although, current treatments such as radiation, surgery, and drugs have shown some effects, they fail to effectively eradicate the tumors, and are associated with adverse side effects. This leads to the requirement of an alternate treatment. In this context, therapeutic cancer vaccine serves as an alternative due to its specificity, ease of administration, safety, and ability to induce long-lasting immunological memory which safeguards against recurrences. A successful therapeutic vaccine is not only expected to generate potent effector CD8+ T cells, but also overcome regulatory T cells induced by tumors. In this regard, potent adjuvants/immunomodulators as a component of vaccine that can efficiently stimulate innate and adaptive effector immune responses as well as reverse/inhibit tumor-mediated regulatory mechanisms without toxic side effects. Therefore, a utilized costimulatory 4-1BBL adjuvant based vaccine and examined its effect on the status of effector CD8+ T cells and Tregs in a cervical cancer mice tumor model. The status of both effector CD8+ T cells and Tregs was examined in spleen by utilizing anti-CD3 stimulation assay to examine the potency of the vaccine. The detection of Anti-SVN antibody and auto-Abs in treated mice using ELISA was utilized to examine the possible harmful effects of the vaccine. The results show 4-1BBL vaccination was able to increase the number of CD8+ T effector cells while decreasing the number of Tregs in both spleen and tumor tissues with potency and little negative side effects. As elevated levels of CD8+ T effector cells with decline in Tregs is associated with a clinically favorable prognosis of cancer patients, this result will help in designing a new vaccine strategies with significant clinical potential.

Patients who undergo chemotherapy lose some of their learning and memory function from a condition known as “chemobrain”. With almost twenty million cancer survivors living in the U.S. alone, it is important that we work to understand and negate chemotherapy induced learning and memory loss. I hypothesized that one reason for this memory loss could be white matter damage due to demyelination of axons in the Central Nervous System (CNS). To test my hypothesis, I focused on the effects of a cancer chemotherapy drug on cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Oligodendrocytes allow for increased speed of signal transmission by neurons by providing a myelin sheath for the axons in the CNS. It became immediately apparent that in the presence of a chemotherapy drug called 5-FL (5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine), immature oligidendrocyte progenitor cells were dying at a greater rate than mature oligodendrocytes. Additionally, I found that the cells treated with 5-FL died via apoptosis (programmed cell death) and could be rescued from 5-FL-induced death using an apoptosis inhibitor. Alltogether, this data supports the idea that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis than mature oligodendrocytes, and suggests that the death of these progenitors may influence myelination and cognitive function in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

IDENTIFICATION OF IKB KINASE BETA INHIBITORS THROUGH STRUCTURE BASED VIRTUAL SCREENING
Radha Madhuri Venkatesan
Grafton High School, Yorktown, VA

Inflammation is a short term friend, long term foe. While short-term inflammation protects the body from infections, injuries and other harmful stimuli, prolonged inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes, and heart attack. IkappaB kinase beta (IKKb) enzyme acts as a central coordinator of inflammatory responses. It activates the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. Overexpression of IKKb has been found in many chronic diseases and hence, inhibition of aberrant activation of IKKb is a promising therapeutic target. Unlike the traditional drug discovery process, structure based virtual screening help speed up drug development, making more efficient use of time and money. This method relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the protein. As there has been no experimental structure reported for the IKKb, this study was focused to model the three-dimensional structure of IKKb protein kinase domain and identify suitable inhibitors. Twenty models of IKKb were generated using Swiss PDB Viewer and fold recognition servers and validated using PROCHECK, ERRAT and VERIFY3D software. Top three structures were chosen based on validation scores. Ten potential inhibitors were selected from Pubchem database. Docking studies were carried out using HEX software. I found that the model constructed with the template 2HAK and the natural product dihydrobetulinic acid docked with higher affinity and with lower docking energy. The positive experimental results suggest that the modeled IKKb protein kinase domain structure is of high quality and dihydrobetulinic acid is a potential lead candidate against diseases related to elevated IKKb activity.

THE COMBINED EFFECT OF CURCUMIN AND PACLITAXEL ON A MODEL OF IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS
Erin Lynn Fischer
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal lung disease that affects roughly five million people worldwide. In these people, excessive fibrotic activity decreases gas exchange. The goal of this research is to determine whether two drugs, paclitaxel and curcumin, used together can decrease fibrotic cell growth while encouraging epithelial cell growth. 5000 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate. To each well, either media with no drugs, with paclitaxel, with curcumin, or both, was added. Plates incubated for 48 hours, and a phosphatase assay was performed. With a p-value of 0.00016, the 99% purity curcumin significantly increased the growth of the epithelial cells. 99% curcumin on fibrotic cells, with a p-value of 0.76586 shows insignificant increase in growth. The p-value for the effect of paclitaxel against the epithelial cell line was 0.18711, showing an insignificant effect. With a p-value of 2.04E-10, the paclitaxel had a significant effect against the growth of the fibrotic cells, decreasing their numbers by nearly 50% in 48 hours. The computed p-value of 3.66E-08 for the effects of the combination drugs on the epithelial cell line points to a strong increase in growth. A p-value of 0.02702 for the effects of the combination drug treatment against fibrotic cells points to a significant decrease in fibrotic cell growth. It can be confidently said that the combination of curcumin and paclitaxel is a viable treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

EXOGENOUS RETINOIC ACID SUPPLEMENTS AS A NOVEL APPROACH TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE PHENOTYPES OF FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME USING A ZEBRAFISH MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT
Ayana Jamal
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

In this investigation, an animal model of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was used to test out a potential rescue treatment. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if exogenous retinoic acid supplements could be used as a rescue treatment to restore embryogenesis and reduce the negative FAS phenotypes observed in transgenic zebrafish exposed to ethanol. It was predicted that the supplements should have been able to compensate for the lack of retinoic acid production in development caused by ethanol’s enzymatic competition with retinol and the inhibition of crucial molecular pathways involved in growth. <br><br>Untreated (positive control), ethanol treated (negative control), rescue treated (ethanol and retinoic acid), and retinoic acid treated transgenic embryos were imaged at 48 hours post fertilization under a confocal microscope for real-time visualization. The four groups were also treated early and late in development to determine if time had an effect on the treatments or extent of rescue. Somites were counted and analyzed as a source of quantifiable data, and statistical analysis was conducted to determine if the supplements assisted in the revival of embryonic development.<br><br>The results concluded that the retinoic acid supplements effectively rescued the FAS embryos and decreased the negative phenotypes associated with FAS when treated early on in development, but was less successful when treated later. Currently, FAS is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation in the U.S. and it is essential for the scientific community to gain more insight into potential rescue treatments in order to reduce the harmful effects that arise. As this study shows, retinoic acid appears to be a promising treatment method for rescuing the negative effects of FAS.

A NOVEL USE OF AMD3100 AS A TREATMENT FOR METASTATIC LUNG CANCER
Brianna Pereira
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack, NJ

An issue with lung cancer treatment is that once the cancer metastasizes, most therapeutics become ineffective, necessitating novel treatments. One potential treatment involves perturbing pathways promoting cell migration, such as the CXCR4/SDF-1a pathway. In leukocyte trafficking, the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4(CXCR4) promotes migration toward stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha(SDF-1a), the ligand of CXCR4. Some non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC) such as A549 express functional CXCR4 which in vivo, contribute to metastases. This research investigated whether A549 migration toward SDF-1a could be inhibited by the immunostimulant AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Immunostaining verified CXCR4 in A549. A migration assay against SDF-1a (0.1-100ng/mL) demonstrated positive chemotaxis (p<0.05) implying functional CXCR4. Migration against SDF-1a (100ng/mL) on AMD3100 treated A549 (1.25-320µg/mL) demonstrated inhibited migration (p<0.01) as hypothesized. Flow cytometry and immunostaining suggested receptor endocytosis may facilitate this inhibition. ELISAs for matrix metalloproteinases involved in cell migration demonstrated increased MMP12 (p<0.01) and decreased MMP9 in treated A549 (p<0.05). Increased MMP12 is reported to be a positive prognostic indicator, while decreased MMP9 reduces degradation of the extracellular matrix potentially abrogating tumor cell mobility. MTS and Caspase 3/7 activation assays showed reduced viability in treated A549 (p<0.05). pAKT, significant in cell viability, was reduced at ser473 and thr308 in treated A549 (p<0.05), suggesting mechanisms of antitumor potential. Reduced p-thr308 correlates with improved prognosis. CXCR4 expression was modulated by AMD3100. Results suggest AMD3100 is a potential novel treatment of metastatic NSCLC.

FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF THE PIK3CA MUTANT H1047R AND HER2 GENES WITH AND WITHOUT INHIBITORS IN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Shirley Zhang Wu
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

Scientific Problem: <br><br> The efficacy of treatment of breast cancer patients with the new drug Herceptin is compromised due to drug resistance.<br><br> Hypothesis: <br><br> Since Herceptin only targets the single gene HER2, the use of two inhibitors targeting both the HER2 and a related gene PIK3CA would be more effective than the use of one drug alone, provided that the two genes interact and cause an additive or synergistic oncogenic effect.<br><br>Methods: <br><br> Several functional assays were performed using breast cancer cells over expressing the HER2 gene, the PI3K mutant gene H1047R, or both, in the absence or presence of different doses of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), CP724714 (HER2 inhibitor), and both inhibitors.<br><br>Results: <br><br> Over expression of both the HER2 and the mutant H1047R genes significantly enhances cell growth, colony formation, and invasion of breast cancer cells, when compared to those of either single gene. A combination of the two inhibitors blocked cell growth and colony formation more effectively than treatment with one drug alone. Also, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) is a more potent inhibitor with less potential of developing resistance and generating cancer stem cells, than CP724714 (HER2 inhibitor).<br><br>Conclusions: <br><br> The data validates the hypothesis that there is an additive or synergistic oncogenic effect caused by the over expression of the HER2 and PIK3CA genes in breast cancer, and that the use of two inhibitors targeting both signaling pathways is more potent than using a single inhibitor alone. Future therapeutic agents should be designed to target the PIK3CA gene instead of the HER2 gene in order to improve the treatment of patients with Herceptin-resistant breast cancer.

THE ROLE OF THE MIR-106B-25 MIRNAS IN PREDICTING BREAST CANCER OUTCOMES IN DIFFERENTIAL SUBTYPES
Nicolette Marie Laird
Monarch High School, Louisville, CO

This study observed how the expressions of the miR-106b-25 miRNAs could be used to predict breast cancer patient outcomes. Based on previous work showing that the miR-106b-25 miRNAs are downstream of Six1 and induce breast cancer phenotypes, the hypothesis is that these miRNAs will be predictive of breast cancer patient outcome in human data sets. In addition, this study predicts that the miR-106b-25 miRNAs will have differential expression and outcome results in different breast cancer subtypes, and will specifically be enriched in Luminal B breast cancers, where Six1 is enriched and predictive of breast cancer outcome. I analyzed publicly available data-sets for relapse and survival rates based on the miRNA expressions. In order to simulate the results found in actual human tumors, I used real-time PCR to find the miRNA expressions of different cell-line subtypes. It was found that the expressions of the miR-106b-25 miRNAs are predictive of breast cancer patient outcomes. The highest expressions of the miRNAs are in Luminal B tumors. The expressions between cell-lines and human tumors are inconclusive. More study and more trials need to be performed in order to make definite conclusions.

REGULATION AND ROLE OF REGULATOR OF G-PROTEIN SIGNALING-1 IN CELIAC DISEASE PATHOGENESIS
Yiyun Cao
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by oversensitivity to gluten. A recent genome wide association study has linked regulator of G-protein signaling-1 (RGS1) to CD, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which collectively represent either a celiac susceptibility or protective haplotype have been identified. This investigation focused on how these SNPs affect RGS1 expression at the promoter, transcriptional, and translational levels in response to interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, and interleukin-15, which are highly expressed in CD. The functional significance of RGS1 was also studied in lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. At the promoter level, IFN-beta significantly upregulated expression in the protective SNP, but not in the susceptibility SNP. IFN-beta also increased transcriptional and translational levels of RGS1. In cytotoxicity assays, IFN-beta increased cytotoxicity, likely through upregulation of RGS1. These results suggest a new framework for the role of RGS1 in CD pathogenesis. Although it increases cytotoxicity, higher levels of expression in the protective SNP imply that RGS1 has beneficial effects, potentially through prevention of viral infections which can trigger CD or by reduction of autoantibody production. Further investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the diverse effects of RGS1.

IMPROVING CANCER THERAPY: A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT UTILIZING CORDYCEPIN SYNERGY TO DECREASE ADVERSE TREATMENT EFFECTS
Jason Shao Cui
Langley High School, McLean, VA

Modern methods of cancer treatment like chemotherapy are effective in eradicating cancer cells; however, the following immunosuppression and cellular damage that occur are often strenuous on the human body. This study sought to design a novel therapeutic treatment model that could reduce adverse effects experienced by patients, and also be applied to multiple forms of cancer and their respective treatment regimes. Studies with the adenosine analog Cordycepin (3’-deoxyadenosine) extract from Cordyceps sinensis have proven its ability to induce cancer cell apoptosis through polyadenylation interference while preventing damage to healthy cells. However, Cordycepin meets intrinsic resistance in the body from adenosine deaminase (ADA). Therefore, Cordycepin coupled with an ADA inhibitor can potentially form a novel therapy that expresses a decrease in cytotoxicity toward healthy cells. The chemo-drug/ADA inhibitor Cladribine used in synergy was hypothesized to work in two ways: 1) Cladribine, as an ADA inhibitor, induces synergism in its apoptotic anti-cancer effect on cancer cells, and 2) the enhanced efficacy of the combinative treatment allows for the reduction of the toxic chemo-drug, alleviating Cladribine’s toxicity on healthy cells while maintaining treatment efficacy. The novel treatment was assessed through morphological observation and flow cytometric analysis and confirmed through proliferative assays. Results indicated that Cordycepin/Cladribine synergy experienced similar levels of cancer cell inhibition as Cladribine alone, but exhibited a significant increase in healthy cells left unharmed. The combinative treatment also effectively models the potential to expand Cordycepin to additional chemo-drugs/ADA inhibitors and better patient outlooks for respective treatments.

THE EFFECT OF ASAFOETIDA AND SALVIA HISPANICA WITH CARBON NANOTUBE ON THE GROWTH OF MCF-7, MDA-MB 231, AND HT29 HUMAN CANCER CELL LINES
Soniya Pateriya
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

The purpose of this project, The Effect of Asafoetida and Salvia hispanica in Carbon Nanotube (CNT) on the Growth of HT29 Human Colon Cancer Cells, MDA-MB 231 Human Breast Cancer Cells, and MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines was to help prevent cancer. In simple words, this project was testing the effect of two herbs on breast and colon cancer cells.<br><br> Asafoetida, native to India, is used as a food flavoring or digestive aid. Salvia hispanica or commonly known as Chia, native to Southern Mexico and Guatemala, is promoted for its high Omega content. In this experiment, homemade solutions of Asafoetida, Chia, and Asafoetida and Chia combined with and without CNT were placed onto cancer cells. The CNT was utilized to help deliver the herbs more efficiently to the cancer cells. Through this experimentation and data collection of cell growth it was understood how effective each substance was individually, combined, and with or without CNT.<br><br> The hypothesis was that, If Asafoetida and Salvia hispanica combined with Carbon Nanotube are spread over cancer cells, then the growth of cancer cells would decrease. The data supported the hypothesis because the lowest cell survival percent control in all three types of cancer cells resulted when the herbs and CNT were combined.<br><br> Overall, the results showed that the Asafoetida and Salvia hispanica, and CNT combined were the most effective in limiting cancer cell growth than the substances were individually. This shows how the future of medicine can truly be enhanced with cancer fighting herbs.<br><br>

BETA-CATENIN AND E-CADHERIN: NOVEL PROTEIN BIOMARKERS FOR IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS OF PRECANCEROUS LESIONS OF THE CERVIX
Ruchi Jayesh Shah
Sachem High School North, Lake Ronkonkoma, NY

Cervical cancer impacts the global population with millions of new cases each year. The Pap test, used to screen for cervical cancer, has limited sensitivity and specificity for underlying high grade disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the expression of two proteins, beta-catenin and E-cadherin, in the malignant transformation of cervical mucosa. Immunohistochemistry, to evaluate the intensity and location of the staining, was performed using optimized antibody dilutions of both proteins on tissue microarrays of each diagnostic category: normal mucosa, low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1), high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The marked difference in localization of beta-catenin from the plasma membrane in normal cervix to the cytoplasm in CIN1 has been previously un-documented and shows great diagnostic potential for CIN1 (p < 0.05). This translocation represents the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in malignant transformation. Conversely, the decrease in the intensity of staining for E-cadherin in SCC confirms the loss of expression of this adherence protein as cervical cancer progresses (p = 0.019). The deregulation of membranous expression of E-cadherin from CIN2/3 to SCC suggests the role of the protein in malignant transformation. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between SCC grade and E-cadherin expression may serve as a more accurate predictive tool for progression and treatment (r = -0.639, p = 0.003). Overall the findings of this study show potential for the use of both beta-catenin and E-cadherin in a clinical setting for more accurate diagnosis of precancerous lesions of the cervix.

DIETARY ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ENHANCES OVERGROWTH PHENOTYPES RESULTING FROM DISRUPTION OF THE HIPPO PATHWAY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Anoj Ilanges
Oceanside High School, Oceanside, NY

Chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver cancer by 20% and breast cancer by 31%. Despite this connection, how alcohol promotes cancer remains unknown. Using a screen, I looked to identify interactions between alcohol and disruption of well characterized signaling pathways in D. melanogaster to find possible mechanisms. One interaction I found was with loss of Hippo, a key tumor suppressor that has also been shown to be downregulated in nearly 30% of liver cancers. Gal4/UAS targeted reduction of hippo in the wing via RNA-interference (RNAi) produced an overgrowth phenotype that was enhanced by alcohol. Next to evaluate if this was a global interaction for Hippo or if this was an artifact, I created mosaic eye models. When these mosaics were exposed to alcohol, there was an increase in mutant tissue, indicating that alcohol enhances mutant tissue growth. Then I individually knocked down the other Hippo Pathway tumor suppressors —merlin(upstream), expanded (upstream), and warts(downstream)— using RNAi and overexpressed the downstream target—yorkie— in the wing . Each manipulation produced wing overgrowth and upon alcohol exposure there was a phenotypic enhancement seen only with expanded knockdown. Thus this interaction occurred at or after Hippo but before Warts and was a novel Yorkie-independent interaction. Finally using the Gal4/UAS system I created mutant, GFP+ fat body (the larval liver analog). By visualizing GFP, I saw that both hippo and expanded RNAi produced overgrowth while yorkie mutants had normal looking fat bodies. Now with characterized models of the Hippo Pathway in the fat body, I will analyze the interaction between alcohol and the pathway more specifically for the liver and look for a novel downstream target for this interaction.

SPICING UP THE CASPASE PATHWAYS: NOVEL TARGETED CURCUMIN-LOADED NANOPARTICLES IN ALZHEIMER’S TREATMENT
Aishwarya Raja
Academy for Medical Science Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulations of amyloid beta protein (AB) in the brain and the activation of apoptotic pathways facilitated by caspase proteins. Curcumin is a component of a common Indian spice, turmeric, and has been shown to inhibit AB oligomer formation in AD cells. However, the bioavailability of orally administered curcumin is relatively low because it breaks down into metabolites that do not penetrate the blood brain barrier as well as free curcumin can. Therefore, curcumin drugs against AD are rendered ineffective over time. In this project, novel curcumin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were constructed as vehicles for free curcumin delivery to in vitro AD cell models. To further study the role of the NPs, the treatment will be administered to an in vivo AD model, Caenorhabditis elegans. The results of this in vivo study are currently pending. A nanoprecipitation technique was used to prepare the curcumin-loaded NPs with a 95% yield and 60% entrapment efficiency after membrane filtration. The surface morphology and intracellular structure of the curcumin-loaded NPs was imaged with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The protective role of the curcumin-loaded NPs versus free curcumin alone on AB oligomer formation, caspase activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear fragmentation was investigated with specific staining reagents and imaged with fluorescent microscopy. Overall, the project demonstrated that curcumin-loaded NPs more significantly protected against AB-induced cytotoxicity and inhibited caspase-mediated apoptosis than did free curcumin alone. The project indicated that curcumin-loaded NPs may be a viable treatment against AD and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases.

EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANTS ON METAL ION INHIBITED CATALASE: SIGNIFICANCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Karthik Balaji Chakravarthy
Beavercreek High School, Beavercreek, OH

Catalase, the antioxidant enzyme present in living organisms, decomposes hydrogen peroxide, a toxic byproduct of cell metabolism, into oxygen and water. Malfunction of catalase leads to the buildup of reactive oxygen species. This impacts the biological system’s ability to protect cells from oxidative damage, leading to Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Results of research conducted in last year’s science project confirmed that one of the factors inhibiting the performance of catalase is the presence of metal ions. The purpose of the current research is to experiment and infer whether the inhibitory effects of metal ions on catalase can be reduced by antioxidants namely: vitamins A, B, C, E, and Curcumin. It was hypothesized that vitamins which are by nature antioxidants would mitigate the effect of the metal ions, and that vitamin C would perform the best due to its immune boosting qualities. The Floating Disc Method was used to assay the performance of catalase in the presence of the metal ions and various antioxidants. This method involves soaking a filter paper disc in the catalase test solution, dropping it in hydrogen peroxide, and noting the time taken for the disc to rise. 3 of the worst inhibiting metal salts namely: iron chloride, copper chloride and aluminum chloride, were tested, and the results indicated that vitamin C inhibited catalase even more, while all the other vitamins improved catalase performance, with curcumin enhancing catalase performance the best. The results have clearly revealed a preventative measure and a possible cure for neurodegenerative diseases.

EARLY STUDIES ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NOVEL PROTEINS FOUND IN A MACROMOLECULAR METABOLIC COMPLEX IN LEUKEMIA CELLS
Mahati Pidaparti
Wayzata High School, Plymouth, MN

The key to effective novel cancer therapies may be found through a better understanding of the binding interactions of proteins. The objective of my project was to investigate binding interactions involving two members of the Bcl-2 family, regulators of cell survival and death. These two proteins, Noxa and Mcl-1L were determined to be components of a large complex along with PSMa3 (or HC8), GAPDH (a glycolytic enzyme), EF1Gamma; (a glutathione transferase), and PHLPP2 (a phosphatase) in T-leukemia cells. This complex appears to promote glucose uptake and metabolism. HC8 is a carrier protein to the proteasome, where proteins are degraded, and I hypothesize that it may interact with and regulate the stability of Mcl-1L and/or Noxa in response to stress. I suggest that GAPDH also interacts with Mcl-1L and is recruited to the complex to prevent the activation of glycolysis, thus diverting glucose metabolism to pathways that promote cell division. I tested for interactions between these proteins using in vitro translated products and fractionated cellular extracts. An understanding of the interactions between HC8, Noxa, Mcl-1L and GAPDH will lead to a better understanding of the role of these proteins in the complex and their contribution to cancer growth and survival. This research could potentially contribute to the development of new drugs targeted at this complex in leukemia and lymphoma patients.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO INHIBITING BREAST CANCER PROGRESSION: OVEREXPRESSION OF THE PROLINE-RICH DOMAIN OF CDGAP
Meagan Helen Henderson
Marianopolis College, Westmount, Quebec, CANADA

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide, accounting for 23% of the total new cancer cases and 14% of the total cancer deaths in 2008. The development of metastatic breast tumors is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in breast cancer patients. Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP), a serine- and proline-rich RhoGAP, shows GAP activity against Cdc42 and Rac1. CdGAP is required for transforming growth factor ß- (TGFß) and Neu/ErbB-2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion, promoting metastasis. It has been demonstrated through rescue analysis that the proline-rich domain (PRD) of CdGAP is essential to the mediation of TGFß-induced cell motility and invasion. This study aims to determine if the PRD of CdGAP acts as a dominant negative form of CdGAP. Through transfection of the GFP control vector and the GFP-PRD plasmid into Neu-NT-expressing mammary tumor explants, the GFP-PRD localized in the perinuclear region and in the cell membrane. Transfection efficiency was confirmed via Western blotting. In response to TGFß stimulation for 24 hours, the cell motility of the cells transfected with GFP-PRD was reduced compared with the control cells. The results were statistically significant. In addition, the overexpression of PRD in CdGAP significantly increased cell adhesion of Neu-NT-expressing cells treated with TGFß. This study therefore identifies the PRD as a dominant negative form of CdGAP and as a novel potential therapy target for preventing early stage breast cancer metastasis.

A STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIMICROBIAL SCRUBS WHEN USED AS AN AID IN THE PREVENTION OF NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS
Megan Elizabeth Moody
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL

The purpose of this project was to test multiple scrub fabrics in order to determine which one effectively protected against pathogens which may cause nosocomial infections. If a fabric has been treated to offer antimicrobial protection, then bacteria should be less likely to survive on this fabric and of these I thought the silver ion infused scrubs would offer the most protection. I selected four fabrics (a polyester/cotton blend, a polyester/cotton blend that I treated with an antimicrobial solution, scrubs labeled and sold as antimicrobial, and silver ion infused scrubs) and then exposed them to bacteria in a lab. I put the bacteria directly on the fabric and then set up 24 hour growth cultures. I also performed a real world test so I had three phlebotomist wear armbands made from each type of fabric and then set up cultures from these fabrics. <br><br>The fabric made with the silver infused ions offered the most protection from bacteria. However, the other treated fabrics offered some degree of protection in comparison to the control fabric. The effectiveness of the silver infused fabric in preventing bacterial growth was again displayed when I conducted my real world experiment. This served as a confirmation of my original lab-based results. In conclusion, I discovered my hypothesis was correct. <br><br>It is critical for hospitals to take steps to prevent nosocomial infections and I hope that the results of my experiment can be used by healthcare workers to provide better patient care.

DIAGNOSING PREMATURE CANCER MATHEMATICALLY UTILIZING MINKOWSKI DIMENSION
Daniel David White
Somerset Berkley Regional High School, Somerset, MA

The objective of this experiment was to detect if a cell is cancerous based on the Minkowski dimension of its membrane. Minkowski dimension models the behavior of a fractal. A fractal is an irregular geometry demonstrating recursion (repetition on smaller or larger scales). Minkowski dimension characterizes the structure of the membrane to differentiate between normal and cancerous cells.<br><br>Cancer is defined as uncontrolled growth and division of cells due to the failure of apoptosis, the ability of a cell to kill itself when it malfunctions. Uncontrolled growth results in structural irregularities in the cell membrane, detectable by differences in the Minkowski dimension.<br><br>An original computer program was designed to determine relative Minkowski dimensions of cells. A digital microscope captured images from two different views of the same slide. Two slides were analyzed: one of normal skin cells and the other of basal cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer). The program mapped two-dimensional cell images to three-dimensional space, and calculated their relative Minkowski dimensions.<br><br>Comparing relative Minkowski dimensions of normal skin cells yielded a maximum percent difference of 1.8%. The minimum percent difference between normal and cancerous skin cells was 7.3%. It is appropriate to conclude that a skin cell is normal if its relative Minkowski dimension is less than or equal to the median percentage of 4.6%, otherwise it is cancerous.<br><br>Possible applications of this material include the use of biological agents and/or nanobots to provide for diagnosis of cancerous cells and their eradication at a premature state.

The purpose of this research was to identify possible explanations as to why the U.S. has such high teenage obesity rates. This study focused on comparing the differences in lifestyle (time spent on internet and physical activities) and food consumption (grains, vegetables, dairy, protein, other) of teenagers in the United States and China by carrying out carefully designed surveys and subsequent statistics analysis. Surveying was performed on high school students in the US and China. The total sample size was 320 students with ages of between 15 through 17. It was found that 13.4% of the teenagers in US were obese, whereas only 4.2% of the teenagers in China were obese. The statistical analysis revealed that the amount of time spent on exercising, time spent on the internet, and the consumption of milk, rice, cheese, fast food, bread, and meat was significantly different among the teenagers in the U.S. and China. These eight factors were then tested for strong correlation with the BMI. From the t-scores and p-values of each, it was concluded that the significant differences in the amount of time spent on the internet and the differences in the consumption of milk and cheese between the two countries contributed greatly to the large difference in teenage obesity rates.

MIND OVER MUSCLE
Jessica Danielle Tobin
Success Academy, Cedar City, UT

Does the ‘average’ keep people from pushing it to the limit? Does the perception of what is average keep people from doing their best? The goal of this experiment was to test the effect that the known average can have on athletic performance. Sixty 16 to 18 year old high school physical education students were tested. Students were individually taken aside and asked to do pushups. Before doing pushups an electrocardiogram, set up to work like an electromyogram (EMG), was hooked up to the dominant arm of the student. Prior to being tested each student was informed that a certain number of pushups was average for his or her age and sex. Students were given either the actual average (males: 47, females: 28), a 25% lower average (males: 35, females: 21), or a 25% higher average (males: 59, females: 35), but were also told to do their best. After testing if the student was originally told a false average, the real average was revealed. During data evaluation an effort value was calculated for each participant by subtracting the EMG’s lowest reading from its highest reading. According to an ANOVA test the averages that participants were told were the same as the actual amount of pushups that they did. Correlation was found between effort values and told averages.

TARGETED MDA2 IRON OXIDE PARTICLES FOR IN VIVO MNCL2 ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE DETECTION OF OXIDATIVE EPITOPES IN THE RETINA
Hannah Zoe Street
Hastings High School, Hastings on Hudson, NY

The retina of the eye is extremely susceptible to lipid peroxidation, a process which creates dangerous oxygen specific epitopes (OSE) that trigger the degradation of the retina. This study tested antibodies against MDA (a specific type of OSE) to target accumulations of MDA on retinal tissue and hypothesized that iron loaded MDA2 antibodies would create significant signal loss and allow for imaging of MDA by MRI. Previous studies led us to hypothesize that topical administration of MnCl2 would allow for greater signal enhancement and in turn high contrast compared with the signal loss created by the iron particles. Using a retinal tissue study via histological and MRI data, the student investigator analyzed signal loss created by targeted MDA2 antibodies accumulated on the mouse retina that were previously treated by the qualified scientist. The scan results presented a significant nonspecific increase (p=0.000044) in signal due to MnCl2 and a significant loss in signal (%NENH value of -52+/-6%) from areas high in MDA concentration (making them high in targeted iron concentration). Data from this tissue analysis support a novel non-invasive method of imaging accumulations of OSE in the retina.

THE DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION OF AUTOPHAGY VS. APOPTOSIS AS A POTENTIALLY UNIQUE MECHANISM FOR CANCER CELL SPECIFIC RADIOSENSITIZATION WITH FLUOXETINE
Nicci Patricia Moran-Guiati
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

Introduction: Prior data demonstrate that selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are cytotoxic to cancer cells and that fluoxetine can sensitize cells to radiotherapy (XRT) potentially through induction of autophagy; however, there is limited information on the effects of serotonergic receptor modulation and mechanisms of other SSRIs on cytotoxicity with radiotherapy.Methods: Human lung cancer lines (A549 and H460) and oropharyngeal cancer cells (FaDu) were treated with dose escalated SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine), serotonergic receptor (5-HTR) agonists (CP809101, S14506), or 5-HTR antagonists (agomelatine, spiroxatrine) alone or in combination with dose escalated XRT to evaluate the effects of on cell survival using clonogenic survival assays. 5-HTR expression, apoptosis, and autophagy were evaluated as potential mechanisms of the effects of SSRIs on XRT. Results: Fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline alone had a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells in a concentration dependent manner. Fluoxetine had a sensitizing effect in combination with XRT in a cell specific manor; however, sertraline and paroxetine had an additive cytotoxic effect on XRT. 5-HTR agonists and antagonists did not demonstrate any significantsensitizing effects, but agonists were cytotoxic at 10-50 uM with no apparent cytotoxicity from antagonists. Western blot analysis demonstrated that fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline decreased apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP) and increased autophagy (LC3B-II) in H460 cells associated with the sensitizing effect of fluoxetine on XRT. In contrast, the additive cytotoxicity of sertraline or paroxetine was not associated with a differential regulation of apoptosis vs. autophagy in A549 cells. Conclusions: SSRIs appear to have a cytotoxic effect alone or in combination with XRT potentially through a non 5-HTRbased mechanism. The cell specific differential regulation of apoptosis vs. autophagy associated with fluoxetine warrants further examination of a potentially unique mechanism of radiosensitization.

DOES THE AMOUNT OF TIME A SINGLE UNIT OF BLOOD STORED IN A BLOOD BANK AFFECT THE POTASSIUM CONTENT?
Renira Michelle Rugnath
Madison Central High School, Madison, MS

My experimented that I conducted was to see if the amount of time a single unit of blood stored in a blood bank affects the Potassium content. I predicted that if the blood in the blood bank were exposed to longer periods of storage, then the potassium content in those units of blood would increase exponentially. I had to go to the University of Mississippi, go to the Operating Room, collect the blood sample slips measured by a blood gas measurement machine, and analyze the data. After completing six trails- each trail including three units of blood stored for four days, six days, and eight days- I noticed that there was a noteworthy increase in the Potassium levels from four days to six days and then to eight days. My prediction turned out to be correct and I concluded that my experiment did support the idea that time does affect the potassium content of a single unit of blood that had been stored in a blood bank. My experiment will benefit children and infants who are undergoing procedures for potassium levels in donated blood plays a significant role in the probability of a cardiac arrest.

ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL OF SKIN DERIVED SCHWANN CELLS FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE REMYELINATION
Sarthak Sinha
Henry Wise Wood High School, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

The discovery of Skin Derived Precursor Schwann Cells (SKP-SCs) is considered a hallmark in stem cell research as it introduces the possibility of treating severe Peripheral Nervous System disorders and traumas using dermal stem cells. Skin Derived Precursor (SKPs) are multipotent stem cells which reside at the base of hair follicles and can be cultured in-vitro to enrich their Schwann cell progeny through exposure in glial media. SKPs are characterized to take the phenotype of Schwann cells, a population of myelinating glial cells of the Peripheral Nervous System. This study aimed to uncover the therapeutic potential of SKP-SCs by analyzing the expression of myelinating markers, Oct-6 and Krox-20, in comparison to Schwann cells derived from the nerve and embryonic stage. To answer whether dermal precursors would serve as a viable source of myelinating Schwann cells, all different cells groups were cultured in-vitro and immunostained to localize the expression of the selected genes. With three repetitions from different cell lines, experimentations concluded that SKPs hold the potential to yield Schwann cells expressing a significantly higher percentage of Oct-6 and Krox-20 positive cells than nerve derived, suggesting a population with superior myelination capacity. Furthermore, it was also evident that SKP-SCs exhibit a similar phenotype as Schwann cells in their embryonic stage. Results form this study clearly indicate that Schwann cells derived from the skin serve as an optimal population of cells for transplantations following peripheral nerve injuries and trauma.

EFFECTS OF NOVEL HISTONE DEACETYLASE (HDAC) INHIBITORS ON BREAST CANCER CELL LINES
Camille Champigny
Ecole L'Odyssee, Moncton, New-Brunswick, CANADA

Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer, which has created a need for the development of treatments that are cancer-cell specific. Potent histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are of growing interest because, through histone hyperacetylation, they express pro-apoptotic genes of cancerous cells and have little effect on non-cancerous cells. This study focused on 13 novely synthesized hydroxamic acids and imidazolyl derivative HDACi. Their growth inhibitory action was measured on two cancerous breast cell lines, MCF7 and MBA-MB-231, and a non-cancerous breast cell line, MCF10A, using a fluorometric viability assay. The HDACi were separated in two groups defined by their hydrophobic linker configuration. The results demonstrated that HDACi, with the longest hydrophobic linker, caused a pronounced growth inhibition on the cancerous MCF7 cell line, while HDACi, in the other group, had little effect on the cell line. Also, the proliferation of the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cell line was not affected by any HDACi. However, the group of HDACi with the longest hydrophobic linker tested on the cancerous MDA-MB-231 cell line did not have a growth inhibitory effect. This raises questions about the cause of this irregularity. A previous group demonstrated that a particular HDACi in the longest hydrophobic linker length group was more efficient at inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 in vitro. This may suggest that the HDACi-sensitive MCF7 cell line over expresses HDAC 6. Furthermore, in addition of inhibiting cancerous cell growth, the compounds may have migration arrest properties due to this enzyme’s interaction with alpha-tubulin, potentially preventing cancer metastasis.

CITRACIL: THE ANTI-COLORECTAL CANCER ACTIVITY OF AN ESSENTIAL OIL FROM LEMONGRASS
Yichen Zhang
Richmond Secondary School, Richmond, British Columbia, CANADA

Previously, my project investigated lemongrass oil’s effect on colorectal cancer correlated bacteria, and also showed that it was killing cancer cells with PI staining, although the type of cell death was not differentiated. The purpose of this year’s project is to investigate the ability for an essential oil from the lemongrass variety of Cymbopogon citratus to induce apoptosis in the colorectal cancer cell lines HCT 116 and HT-29. Tests that were used to evaluate the method of cytotoxicity include flow cytometry using Annexin V and PI, DAPI and lamin B labelling, western blot analysis for cleaved lamin A/C, and DNA laddering assays. Cells were collected after 6 hours of treatment at concentrations of 10 and 30 µg/ml with crude lemongrass oil or pure lemongrass oil from Sigma Aldrich. Results from the flow cytometry demonstrated that treated cultures with lemongrass oil are 99% late and early apoptotic in both cell lines. With regards to the labeling, lamin B degradation, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic bodies were observed, which demonstrated as markers of apoptosis. The western blot analysis for lamin A/C also showed an increased amount of cleaved lamin A/C in the treated samples, indicating the activation of caspases 6, a protease that is exclusively activated during apoptosis. Finally, DNA laddering using agarose gel electrophoresis has shown signs of DNA degradation in treated samples. More trials will be done to confirm the findings and a major chemical constituent of the oil will also be tested on the cell lines as a comparison.

THE EFFECTS OF LYCIUM BARBARUM OF THE FORMATION OF CATARACTS
Christina Ding
Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School, Waterloo, ON, CANADA

Cataracts are opacities of the crystalline lens that reduce the optical quality of the lens and can result in blindness. Experimental studies show that exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) light induces cataract formation by increasing the number of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), which leads to oxidative damage to lens proteins. Antioxidants can prevent cataractogenesis by preventing the production of or eliminating ROSs. Lycium barbarum (goji berry; GB) is an edible fruit that contains high amounts of the antioxidant, zeaxanthin. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Lycium barbarum can prevent UV light-induced cataractogenesis. Lenses from bovine eyes were cultured in medium with or without GB extract, and were exposed to UV light or were placed in the UV incubator in a light-proof container. Assessments of the optical quality of the lens were made using the variability in the back vertex distances (BVDs) of the lens, which were measured by a scanning laser monitor system. UV-irradiated lenses cultured in medium (UV-med) showed significant increases in BVD variability at 11 and 14 days post-irradiation compared to the values obtained prior to UV-irradiation (both time points p<0.0001). No time-dependent changes in BVD variability were detected in UV-irradiated lenses cultured with GB (UV-GB) nor in lenses that were not irradiated (all p>0.05). The BVD variability observed for the UV-med lenses were significantly greater than those of the UV-GB and the non-irradiated groups (all p<0.0049). The results indicate that goji berries can prevent or delay UV light-induced damage to bovine lenses.

EXTRACELLULAR HISTONES ENHANCE LPS-INDUCED CYTOKINE PRODUCTION
Peter Zhou
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Over the last twenty years, the debilitating clinical condition known as sepsis has tripled in frequency to become the tenth leading cause of death in the United States. Extracellular histones were previously reported to mediate cell damage and organ dysfunction during hyper-inflammatory response. This presented study evaluated the histone-to-LPS relationship and investigated molecular mechanisms responsible for histone-mediated hyper-inflammation. Cytokine levels of histone plus LPS stimulation were compared via ELISA assays. Histone classes (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4) and kinase inhibitors (SB202190, U0126, LY294002) were tested. Western blotting and Coomassie blue staining were used to detect possible protein receptors. Histone plus LPS stimulation synergistically yielded cytokine levels up to 1641% and 325% greater than separate histone or LPS stimulation, respectively (P < 0.05). Cells given H2A and H2B on average contained cytokine levels 1830% and 1180% higher, respectively, when compared to LPS treatment (P < 0.05). ERK1/2 and p38 were determined to be associated with histone signaling. Two target proteins were indicated with MW 37 kD and 90 kD. The roles of ERK1/2 and p38 in inflammatory signaling need further clarification to detail molecular mechanisms responsible for histone-mediated hyper-inflammatory responses in septic patients and ultimately to develop therapeutic interventions for sepsis.

Computer modeling has the potential to predict clinical outcomes based on a variety of factors. This two-year study utilized such innovation to develop a non-invasive, cost-effective procedure to diagnose cardiovascular disease and redesign medical devices to better manage current healthcare practices.<br><br>This study developed a ‘CT to FSI’ methodology, which reconstructed MicroCTs/CTs via Mimics and Gambit to generate Finite Element Models in Adina. Simulated Von-Mises stress, combined with MATLAB analysis of clinical symptoms, determined the patient specific Rupture Potential Index (RPI) of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) and Vulnerable Plaques (VP).<br><br>Previous year’s data indicated that in ruptured AAAs, the ‘RPI’ assessed region and risk of rupture with 100% accuracy. FSI methodologies were applied to address the current study’s objectives to analyze VP microCa presence as a risk factor for fibrous cap rupture denoted by a 2-fold increase in applied stress resultant of advanced VP progression (p<0.002). In both data sets, the new diagnostic methods demonstrated the benefits of combining current clinical assessment with bioengineered structural analysis to eliminate unnecessary surgeries, potentially reducing hospital system deficits by 970 million dollars/yr.<br><br>The study extension uses SolidWorks and Adina ‘FSI’ models to simulate the interaction between platelets and Polymer Heart Valves (PHV) to measure Shear Stress for comparative analysis. This modified methodology optimized the composition and design of PHVs for use in SynCardia’s Total Artificial Heart (TAH). The tapered xSIB (Styrene Isoprene Butadiene) PHV indicated reduced platelet stress accumulation (p<.001) and uniform ‘FSI’ stress distributions, thus reducing TAH thrombogenicity while improving durability.

THE EFFECT OF DEER ANTLER ON THE PROLIFERATION OF ENDOTHELIAL CELLS IN VITRO
Christina Ren
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA

Deer antler is an intriguing substance, and was shown in my last year’s project using the segment regeneration of California worms to have cell regeneration enhancing property. Given wound healing's clinical significance and its relationship to cell regeneration, the present research focuses on examining the effect of deer antler on wound healing, particularly, cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which is one of the four key steps in wound healing. Towards this end, deer antler powder was first homogenized to obtain a water-soluble extract. A Bradford assay was used to determine the protein concentration, and SDS-PAGE was used to determine the molecular weight range of the extract. Two assays were designed and carried out to assess the cell proliferation and angiogenesis, respectively, on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). For the cell proliferation assay, HUVEC were exposed to various concentrations of deer antler extract. After incubation, cell viability and proliferation were determined by means of the MTT assay. It was found that the deer antler extract supplementation yielded over 40% more cell proliferation than the controls. For angiogenesis, the endothelial cell tube formation assay was employed, and it was observed that deer antler extract supplementation yielded more complex tube formation, compared with controls, suggesting that deer antler may contain angiogenic factors. Protein sequencing showed the presence of two protein sequences, one of which was identified as beta-hemoglobin, while the second did not match anything in the database used, and therefore deserves further studies. Overall, this research is an encouraging step towards the possibility of developing deer antler into a novel wound healing agent.

AN IN VITRO STUDY OF THE USE OF CURCUMIN TO INHIBIT THE PROLIFERATION OF MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMOR CELLS
Julia Marie Michels
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

In recent years the use of traditional, medicine has drastically increased worldwide, with more than 80% of the world using these practices as their primary medical practices. Traditional medicine is the knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health. Curcumin is an extract from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has become very prevalent in the study of both the prevention and treatment of many types of cancers. Previous research has shown curcumin to inhibit the vascular epithelial growth to tumors, which cuts off the blood supply and therefore halts growth. With brain tumors being the second highest cancer related death in men and women under the age of 20, a treatment solution is needed. This project aims to use curcumin to inhibit the proliferation of brain tumor cells using the glioblastoma cell line SNB19. The curcumin is tested in 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250µmol/L dosages on the SNB19 cell line in a 96-well plate. A high dosage range was used to determine the IC50, or dosage in which 50% of the cells are viable. The cells are treated with a high dosage range from 0-250µmol/L for an incubation period of 4h, and compared to a control of a DMSO solution.

NOISE EXPOSURE OF TEENAGERS FROM MP3 PLAYERS
Sam Quintrell Wood
Mt. Ararat High School, Topsham, ME

This experiment examined whether teenagers are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss from listening to music on their MP3 players. Thirty teenagers listened to the same song on a MP3 player and asked to adjust the volume to their preferred level. This provided a time-weighted average sound level of the music. To determine the length of exposure, each subject completed a survey about the number of hours per week they listen to their MP3 players. Subjects were also asked about whether they liked or disliked the chosen song to determine if that affected volume levels. The results were compared with the exposure rating allowed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).<br><br> The results showed that according to the OSHA standards, 5 out of the 30 teenagers (16.6%) are listening to music for longer and at higher noise intensity than recommended. However, when compared to the NIOSH standards, 16 out of the 30 teenagers (53.3%) are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss. Song preference did not seem to influence the results.

YOU SAY TO‘MA-TO, I SAY TO-‘MÄ-TO: THE EFFECT OF DIALECT ON SPEECH DISABILITIES
Emily Frances Venner
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, MO

Speech disabilities affect a significant number of today’s youth. Students are expected to meet the national standards of communication. However, throughout the United States people communicate using different dialects which vary by pronunciation, grammar, and other variations within a single language. This project has been designed to determine if dialect has a measurable effect on a person’s likelihood to develop a speech disability. <br><br>The hypothesis states that the dialect regions from the southern portion of the United States would have a higher percentage of speech disabilities than other regions. A map was composed of the 17 main dialect regions. In each region five schools were selected at random and contacted for their number of third grade students receiving services for speech disabilities. This information was utilized to calculate the percentage for the school and an average percentage for each region.<br><br> A Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test determined there was no statistically significant difference between the 17 different dialect regions as a whole. However, a Mann-Whitney pairwise comparison revealed four of the regions showed statistically significant results when compared individually with other single regions. There is not enough of a variance in the data to declare a statistical difference between the dialect regions of the United States as a whole and my hypothesis was indicated to be invalid. The data did show the Upper North/Midwest region at 12.5% with speech disabilities, which indicated a higher percentage of speech disabilities when compared to the New England Eastern regions at 4.54%.

HYPERTENSION AND ENDOTHELIN-1 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UTERINE LEIOMYOMA PROLIFERATION
Justin Deion Porter
William B. Murrah High School, Jackson, MS

Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are benign tumors of the female reproductive tract and are a major cause of infertility in women of reproductive age. Fifty percent of UMC patients undergoing hysterectomy for uterine fibroids have underlying hypertension. Hypoxia, decreased oxygen, is implicated in the transformation and aberrant cell growth of normal myometrial cells into leiomyomas. We and others have shown a potent vasoconstrictor peptide Endothelin-1 (ET-1) to be associated with fibroid growth. We hypothesize that hypoxia stimulated ET-1 is a link between the development of uterine leiomyoma and hypertension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia stimulated ET-1 in the human myometrium similar to that seen in fibroids. Immediately following hysterectomy, fibroids and myometrium are excised and cultured in a modular incubator chamber programmed for hypoxia cycles (final 1%pO2). Intermittent hypoxia (IMH) for 6 hours was followed by 18hours normoxia (6%pO2). ET-1 was measured from culture supernatants by ET-1 ELISA and mRNA was measured via real-time PCR. ET-1 increased in fibroid media compared to myometrium (9.69+2.72 vs 6.81+1.41pg/mg/mL). ET-1 mRNA was significantly increased in fibroid tissue (14.37 + 0.11ΔCT) compared to myometrium (10.28+.56 ΔCT; p<0.002). Hypoxia stimulated myometrial ET-1 secretion (8.10+2.38pg/mg/mL) and mRNA to levels comparable to ET-1 secretion and mRNA from normoxic fibroid cultures(13.27 vs 8.42 ΔCT). These data indicate that ET-1 is increased in the fibroid and further stimulated by hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia stimulated myometrium ET-1 secretion, similarly to that of uterine leiomyomas, thereby supporting a link between hypoxic-stimulated ET-1, hypertension and uterine fibroids.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE BEST METHOD FOR STORING AUTOPSY BLOOD FOR DNA FORENSIC INVESTIGATION
Dominique Helen Tlomak
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, U.S.A.

DNA is often used in forensic cases for identity testing and, more recently, to obtain information that might help explain cause of death. The ability to properly collect specimens for DNA isolation and analysis is important to preserving forensic evidence. However, there remain questions regarding the optimal way to collect postmortem blood specimens for DNA analysis in forensic cases in order to obtain the most stable DNA for Forensic Investigation. Specifically I wanted to identify the best preservative for storing blood and isolating high quality DNA, and to determine how DNA quality changes over time when blood is stored for up to 4 weeks. I then wanted to determine whether this DNA was suitable for application in downstream PGx forensic assays. Ten samples were collected at the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office in three preservatives: EDTA, Sodium Fluoride, and Sodium Citrate. De-identified samples were then taken to the molecular lab in Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin. The post-mortem blood samples were stored and at each interval DNA was isolated and eluted in TE buffer. Analysis of the samples was composed of quantifying A260/A280 in order to determine quantity and quality of DNA. My analysis of these results showed that all the preservatives yield good quality DNA up to four weeks, which is functional for PGx forensic analysis. Some subtle differences hinted at which preservative was most appropriate for different timeframes, however there is no distinguishable difference in DNA quality at weekly intervals for up to four weeks.

JAK INHIBITION INCREASES ERBB SIGNALING, ENHANCING SENSITIVITY TO COMBINATION THERAPY OF JAK/ERBB BLOCKADE IN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Shu Hui Liu
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

Cancer is characterized as uncontrolled and irregular cell growth. Stat3 has been found to be activated in a number of cancers. JAK inhibitor (AZD1480), a known inhibitor of the JAK/Stat3 pathway was found to be an effective treatment initially, but over time, cells soon became resistant to this treatment. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the mechanism of this resistance. The first step was to look at which proteins were activated with JAK inhibition. Western Blot analysis revealed that JAK inhibitor increased erbB/Her family (EGFR, erbB2/Her2, erbB3/Her3) receptor phosphorylation and well as ERK phosphorylation. This suggests that the erbB family members and its downstream oncogenic pathway Ras/MEK/ERK may play a key role in this resistance. However, the specific erbB/Her family receptor responsible for this resistance is still unknown. After cell proliferation and flow cytometry assays were conducted, it was revealed that Lapatinib and JAKi were the best treatments to Her2 overexpressing cell lines. This is because combination therapy largely increased the percentage of dead cells manifested by sub-G1 level with the addition of Lapatinib, instead of creating a G2/M blockade. This suggests that Her2 may be responsible for the resistance to JAK inhibition. Finally, through duolinks assay, it was confirmed that this resistance may be mainly due to interaction between JAK1/2 and Her2. This significantly impacts current treatments because it establishes the mechanism of resistance (Her2 receptor phosphorylation), which leads to better treatment. However, further studies are warranted to test these effects in in vivo, pre-clinical experiments.

BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR TRANSCRIPT EXPRESSION IN HIPPOCAMPUS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SUBJECTS
Camilla Ann Michalski
Bishop Ryan High School, Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor critical for the development, function and survival of neurons, is decreased in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain and contributes to memory loss. Numerous transcripts of the BDNF gene allow for differential and specific regulation. In the AD human cortex, the decrease in total BDNF is a cumulative effect of the down regulation of several transcripts.<br><br> The aim of this study was to determine if BDNF transcripts are differently regulated in the AD human hippocampus, as transcript expression levels in this region of the brain have never before been analysed. Using real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, total BDNF and BDNF transcripts I, II, IV and V expression levels were compared between 10 AD and 10 control samples. <br><br> Total BDNF expression and the most highly expressed BDNF transcript (IV) were significantly decreased in the AD hippocampus compared to controls. There was a decrease of transcript I expression levels in the AD hippocampus which was not statistically significant. Transcripts II and V expression levels were below the detection level. Therefore, the total BDNF decrease in the AD human hippocampus compared to controls is similar to the effect seen in the cortex and is an effect of the down regulation of transcripts IV and possibly I. However, analysis of the remaining transcripts is needed. <br><br> Expanding our knowledge about transcript regulation in AD in different areas of the brain can lead to finding a means of increasing BDNF expression levels, therefore improving cognitive function.

TERATROGENICITY OF ALUMINUM COMPOUNDS ON ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA
Anjali Chandra
Girls Preparatory School, Chattanooga, TN

This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of aluminum compounds on the development and survival of Artemia franciscana oocytes. To study this, 20 Artemia franciscana oocytes were placed in petri dishes filled with 20 mL of solution of 20, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1% concentrations of the aluminum compounds, Aluminum Chloride, Ammonium Aluminum Sulfate and a combination of the two chemicals. In addition, the same process was conducted with Artemia franciscana nauplii of less than 5 hours of age. The controls for the experiment were nauplii and eggs in pure saline solution. The oocytes were checked daily for indication of hatching and the nauplii were counted for the number surviving. The results revealed that in concentrations 20%-2.5%, the nauplii died after 7 hours of exposure and 0 of the eggs hatched. In the 1% concentrations, 10 nauplii hatched in the combination solution(50%) and reached 100% mortality at day 6. 2 nauplii hatched in the ammonium aluminum sulfate, dying after 1 day, and 3 hatched in the Aluminum Chloride, dying after 2 days. These results supported the comparative hypothesis for the higher concentrations, but did not support the ranking of teratrogenicity, the hatching ratio or the duration of survival for the lower concentrations of the aluminum compounds. From this experiment it can be determined that aluminum compounds are equally and highly teratrogenic and concentrations > than 1% and begin to differentiate in their teratrogenicity at concentrations lower than 1%.

MIXING DRINKS WITH MEDICATIONS
Tristan Lee Lim
DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

This study examined effects of apple juice, beer, Coca Cola, cranberry juice, Gatorade, grapefruit juice, and wine on drug dissolution rates of Nifedipine and Procardia®. Per FDA, simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) were used as control media to compare with different drinks. A tablet of 90 mg Nifedipine or Procardia® was placed in each 900-mL dissolution vessel with one type of drink at 37 degrees Celsius and spun at 100 rpm. A 1-ml sample was removed every 15 minutes for 4 hours, and HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) assay was used to measure percent drug releases in each drink medium. Nifedipine and Procardia® had similar percent drug releases in 4 hours (7.83% vs 7.36% in SGF and 5.72% vs 5.72% in SIF). Student t-tests showed statistically significant differences in the percent drug releases for both drugs at four hours for five media: beer, Coca Cola, cranberry and grapefruit juices, and wine. Beer (9.28%) and wine (11.6%) significantly increased Nifedipine’s percent drug releases, while cranberry (2.84%) and grapefruit (3.75%) juices decreased them. All four drinks, grapefruit juice (0.92%), Coca Cola (1.08%), wine (1.54%), and cranberry juice (3.30%), significantly decreased Procardia®’s percent drug releases. FDA requires drug manufacturers to perform dissolution studies using either the SGF or SIF. In the real world, drug dissolution could happen in different types of drink media. This co-administration changes the percent drug releases from the standard, tested by drug manufacturers, and can lead to adverse effects similar to overdosing or underdosing.

THE EFFECTS OF KEFIR
Savannah Cay Phifer
Mansfield R-IV High School, Mansfield, MO

Kefir is a fermented milk product with purported/anecdotal beneficial health qualities. Used by nomads in the Caucus Mountains, kefir is a traditional ethnic food. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate some of the properties of kefir and test its anti-bacterial effects on Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and increasing the longevity of Drosophilia melanogaster.<br><br> Kefir liquid was examined by producing batches of the finished product, comparing it to plain milk and by testing its physical properties. Effects on bacteria were examined by inoculating cultures of bacteria with known antibiotics and kefir, incubating, and measuring the zones of inhibition. The longevity of Drosophilia melanogaster was measured by comparing the lifespan of colonies raised on standard yeast feed (control) and the experimental group exposed to kefir.<br><br> Kefir demonstrated positive inhibition properties similar to conventional antibiotics on gram positive and gram negative bacteria and increased the lifespan of Drosophilia compared to the control. Kefir cultures produced the expected preservative effect on milk via the fermentation process. <br><br> The Drosophilia results proved interesting, however more factors need to be investigated to document the longevity results. Future studies measuring kefir’s effects on the bacteria/fungi load in the culture/habitat medium of the specimens may explain part of the longevity results.

THE EFFECT OF THE CHELATOR EDTA ON THE ENZYMATIC DECOMPOSITION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE: A POSSIBLE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Lauren Elizabeth Hargus
Thayer High School, Thayer, MO

Studies have shown that the cause of Alzheimer’s disease may be the abundance of certain metal ions in the brain. These metal ions have been found to interfere with the enzymatic action of catalase, leaving a build of up hydrogen peroxide in the brain and causing damage to the nerve cells. Chelation therapy is an FDA approved treatment commonly used on patients with lead poisoning or heavy toxin build-up in the body. Its function is to bind to the metal ions and remove them through the urinary tract. This study was performed to determine whether the chelator EDTA would reverse the effect of metal ions on catalase activity, thereby, decreasing the reaction rates, indicating an increase in the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. <br><br>This experiment was conducted by creating four different solutions: one, 20ml of hydrogen peroxide; two, 20ml of hydrogen peroxide and 5ml of EDTA; three, 20ml of aluminum chloride and 5ml of EDTA; four, 20ml of aluminum chloride and 2.5ml of EDTA. A filter paper disc soaked in catalase was placed in each of the solutions for twenty-one trials. The reaction rate was measured by timing the rate at which the disc rose to the surface or the specified height on the test tube. <br><br>The mean reaction rates of the solution were as follows: control (hydrogen peroxide)- 3.74 sec, hydrogen peroxide (20ml)/EDTA (5ml)- 3.30 sec, aluminum chloride (20ml)/EDTA (5ml)- 5.67 sec, aluminum chloride (20ml)/EDTA (2.5ml)- 4.58 sec. The results supported my hypothesis; the chelator was able to bind with the metal and reverse the effect the aluminum ion held on the catalase, thereby, allowing for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen to occur.

THE EFFECT OF CURCUMIN ON THE MITOTIC DIVISION OF CELLS: A POSSIBLE TREATMENT OF CANCER
Meghan Retha Hedden
Thayer High School, Thayer, MO

Curcumin is a compound found in the common household spice turmeric, which is believed to have adverse effects on the developing and spreading of cancer cells. It is also believed to be able to decipher between the cells that are infected with the disease and which cells are healthy.<br><br> This study was to determine if the curcumin would negative effects on the mitotic division of onion cells. The onions were planted and labeled based on the concentration of curcumin solution they received. Their heights were measured every time they were watered. At the end of two months of growth they were dug up and their final heights, bulb diameters, root lengths, and masses were measured. Each onion bulb was then taken and three microscope slides were made from it. The number of cells that were in the resting phases of mitosis and the number that were undergoing division were counted, in each slide. <br><br> My data showed that as my concentrations increased that mean bulb mass of the onions decreased. It also showed that the number of resting cells, and the number of dividing cells decreased as the concentrations increased. The mean bulb diameters were observed to be 1.3cm for the control group, 1.405cm for the 0.20% solution, 1.444cm for the 0.40% solution, and 1.289cm for the 0.80% solution. The mean final stem heights for the onions was, 33.356cm for the control group, 32.621cm for the 0.20% solution, 31.316cm for the 0.40% solution, and 26.221cm for the 0.80% solution. The mean root length of the onions was observed to be 22.738cm for the control group, 13.180cm for the 0.20% solution, 17.033cm for the 0.40% solution, and 15.532cm for the 0.80% solution. In general all of my results show that there was a slight decrease in the measurements as the solution was increased.<br><br> My hypothesis was supported by these results; however, the spice should be tested further. Further testing would include the ability of curcumin to enter the infected cells and cause them to go through apoptosis, while leaving the healthy cells alone. I would also like to test my hypothesis in a lab using animal cells.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN MALARIA CONTROL AND THE IMPACTS OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANT VECTORS
Shashwat Kishore
Unionville High School, Kennett Square, PA

This project is a study of preventive measures in malaria control, looking specifically at Nigeria. The most common preventive measure is the insecticide-treated bednet (ITN). Standard malaria models often do not account for reduction in ITN effectiveness as mosquitoes (sometimes called “vectors”) develop resistance to insecticides. The goals of this project were to quantify ITN effects and to determine whether insecticide resistance has a significant effect on the disease incidence rate (number of cases per year, abbreviated DI). <br><br> A standard malaria model was programmed, and current data was plugged in. The coverage levels were varied and the 5 year and 10 year DIs were recorded for each level. The DI rates (where x is the coverage level) were:<br><br> 5 year DI = 2,861,799 * e^(-0.841x)<br><br> 10 year DI = 2,715,563 * e^(-1.82x)<br><br> Then, the effects of mosquito-resistance were approximated using exponential regressions and programmed into the model. The model was run for the same initial conditions as before, and the new DIs were:<br><br> 5 year DI = 3,065,345 * e^(-0.852x)<br><br> 10 year DI = 3,686,108 * e^(-1.829x)<br><br> Thus, the 10 year DI is 35.7% higher when taking into account mosquito-resistance. <br><br> The implications of this model are two-fold. First, if the WHO goal of 80% coverage is achieved, in five years the DI in Nigeria would decline from 2,969,950 cases per year to 1,550,473 cases per year. Second, failure to regularly boost insecticide effectiveness could result in a significant rise in DI (approximately 35.7% according to the model).

THE EFFECTS OF DIFERULOYLMETHANE ON AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASES: THE EFFECT OF CURCUMIN ON TYPE 1 DIABETES
Dishant Yogendra Chhabra
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

In my project I tested the effect of Curcumin on dendritic cells and t cells. Curcumin is said to be effective as an anti-inflammatory and I wanted to see if it had the same effect of autoimmune diseases. I cultured dendritic cells, and treated it with different concentrations of curcumin. I measured the production of pro inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, TNF- alpha, and NFKB. I wanted to see if the curcumin could inhibit the production of these cytokines causing the T cells not to activate causing the NFKB to not cause diabetes. I treated the cells with 4 different concentrations of curcumin: 0ul, 10ul, 25ul, and 50ul. I treated them for 2 hours in the first experiment and 18 hours for the rest. I saw that all pro inflammatory cytokines had a dose dependent inhibition when treated with curcumin. All cytokines showed slight inhibition which supported my hypothesis that curcumin could be effective in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes.

MODULATION OF ERK1/2 ACTIVITY IN TRABECULAR MESHWORK CELLS: A SIGNALING PATHWAY THAT REGULATES INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN GLAUCOMA
Mahvash Husain
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

Glaucoma affects over 70 million people worldwide. In a normal eye, there is a homeostasis between the production of aqueous humor and its outflow from the eye. This homeostasis is disturbed in glaucoma due to an obstruction in the outflow pathway through the trabecular meshwork resulting in high intraocular pressure. The hypothesis is: “changes in the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase -1 (MKP-1) expression and signaling pathways associated within the trabecular meshwork influence the IOP in the development of glaucoma.” The experimental design was comprised of: primary culture of human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, dose response of IL-1Beta on ERK1/2, and MMP-2 secretion from human TM cells by Western blot analysis. Results presented show that IL-1Beta increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation in a time dependent manner with maximum activation occurring at 15 minutes. IL-1Beta; also increases the secretion of MMP-2 from human TM cells in a concentration dependent manner with maximum secretion occurring at 25 ng/ml. Both IL-1Beta-induced ERK1/2 activation and MMP-2 secretion were completely inhibited when human TM cells were pre-incubated with ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, suggesting that the ERK1/2 pathway regulates the secretion of MMP-2 from human TM cells. Studies were also performed to determine the effects of a corticosteroid, dexamethasone (Dex) on ERK1/2 activation and MMP-2 secretion. These data suggest that Dex treatment up-regulated MKP-1 expression in human TM cells which negatively regulates the activation of ERK1/2 and subsequently the secretion of MMP-2. These findings may be useful to develop better therapeutic agents to control IOP in glaucoma patients.

CCL2 DEFICIENCY, BETA-AMYLOIDOSIS ACCELERATION AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN A MOUSE MODEL OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Mohit Jain
Millard North High School, Omaha, NE

Collecting evidence in the literature connects neuroinflammation to the pathobiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, BETA-amyloid (A-BETA) deposition leads to microglial activation and the subsequent production of proinflammatory neurotoxic factors. For disease control, microglia plasticity enables phenotypic transitions between activation states. One important control for cell activation is seen through the CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor the CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). Both affect monocyte-macrophage activation and ingress across the blood brain barrier. However, how CCL2-CCR2 signaling contributes to AD pathogenesis is not well understood. This study investigates the role that CCL2 deficiency has on the levels of microglia accumulation in the brain, the macrophages of the brain that are responsible for the immune defense of the central nervous system and the effect that this change has on Amyloid-BETA peptide (A-BETA) deposition in the brain. A-BETA is one of the primary markers of Alzheimer’s disease, in its specificity in neurodegeneration. The results show that CCL2 deficiency results in abnormalities and disease in A-BETA precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice. Increased A-BETA deposition in both the cortical and the hippocampal area was coincident with elevated A-BETA oligomers. These results suggest that CCL2 deficiency accelerates AD symptoms with down-regulation of A-BETA clearance by microglia, stimulating the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease more closely. These data, taken together, support a role of CCL2 and its resultant modification in innate immunity for AD pathogenesis.

COCOSUN
Jee Hui Hwang
Marianas Baptist Academy, Saipan, Saipan, NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

CNMI has tropical weather for 365 days. Ultraviolet rays from the sun are harmful to our skins so sunscreen is needed. but inorganic sunscreen also harms our skin. <br><br>Coconut oil which can easily be obtained in any Saipan stores can treat psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, and other skin diseases. " Can natural, organic sunscreen made out of coconut oil protect our skin just as the other brand of sunscreen?" My hypothesis was that homemade, natural, and organic coconut oil sunscreen can protect our skin just as other brand of sunscreen.<br><br>Materials used are coconut oil, Vaseline, ZnO, butter, water, spoon, pot, sausage, oven, and other sunscreen. After combining all these materials, boils, and refrigerate, CoCoSun is produced. CoCoSun was tested in sausages. <br><br>Results showed that CoCoSun can block the UV rays just as the other brand of sunscreen SPF rate foes higher if more zinc oxide and coconut oil are added to make the said sunscreen. "Dry skin CoCoSun" sunscreen, which had 25 SPF, got the lowest burning rate. "Oily skin CoCoSun" sunscreen, which had 15 SPF, had higher burning rate. "Complex skin CoCoSun" sunscreen had the highest burning rate.<br><br>I therefore conclude that CoCoSun could protect, moisturize, and refresh our skin. COCoSun will be available according to the types of your skin,-dry,oily,or complex. We do not need to buy inorganic and expensive sunscreen. coCoSun is the best substitute sunscreen that we can use in Saipan. The researcher highly recommends further improvements for this amazing and inexpensive CoCoSun.

TREATMENT OF B-RAF(V600E) COLORECTAL CANCER
Kay Yi Low
Raffles Institution, Singapore, SINGAPORE

B-RAF, a frequently mutated protein in cancer, is an attractive target for colorectal cancer (CRC) drug treatment. However, resistance to B-RAF inhibitor drugs has been a significant clinical challenge. Effective strategies to overcome B-RAF inhibitor drug resistance are therefore urgently needed. The findings in this project identify that drug resistance is perpetrated by the development of Inverse Regulation Cross-Talk between the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Further investigation shows that the cross-talk resistance mechanism can be intercepted by various combinatorial inhibitor-based therapies. This study not only establishes mechanisms of drug resistance in CRC cells, but also proposes robust strategies to overcome it, thus contributing to our concerted progress towards a cure for CRC.

A BIOINFORMATIC APPROACH TO HIV SEQUENCE DIVERSITY AND CHEMOKINE CO-RECEPTOR DIVERSITY IN GLOBAL POPULATIONS
Leroy M. Daniels
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Baltimore, MD

Background: Bioinformatics is the field of science in which biology and computer science merge. Bioinformatics can be used to study the biology of HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2); and predict how it enters T lymphocytes (CD4+ cells) via chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) in different populations around the world. Some chemokine receptor mutations are common to particular ethnic groups, such as CCR5 deletions in Europeans, which stops HIV from entering CD4+ cells. Our hypothesis states HIV entry efficiency varies in ethnic and regional populations according to the genetic diversity of HIV-1, HIV-2, and host chemokine receptors. <br><br>Methods: The Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database was used to determine HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-1 subtype, and HIV-2 subtype distributions in various regions around the world. The UCSC Genome Browser and 1000 Genomes Database were used to identify chemokine co-receptor variations in target groups. <br><br>Results: HIV-1 is more prevalent than HIV-2 worldwide. HIV-1 appears in ten regions compared to HIV-2 in six regions. HIV-1 subtype B is the most common globally (60.5%). HIV-2 subtype A is the most common globally (87.5%). There are 18 genetic variants for CCR5 and 1 genetic variant for CXCR4 found in 1197 people around the world. CCR5 variation is rare and CXCR4 variation is more common amongst the 5 populations chosen.<br><br>Conclusions: The more common HIV subtypes have better entry into the cell. HIV uses CCR5 to enter T lymphocytes more frequently than CXCR4. The 5 ethnic groups are changing their DNA to adapt to HIV’s high mutation rate.

UTILITY OF THE SPATIAL PEAKS QRS-T ANGLE IN DISTINGUISHING LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY FROM ATHLETIC HEART SYNDROME
Kevin K. Lee
University High School, Irvine, CA

This project proposes the spatial peaks QRS-T angle as a new method of distinguishing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) from athletic heart syndrome (AHS). LVH is a strong risk factor for heart failure and sudden death, while AHS is reflective of an athlete in good shape. These two very different conditions appear virtually identical on the standard 12-lead EKG, posing a significant problem. The Kors’ regression was applied to the 12-lead EKG to orthogonalize the leads and calculate the spatial peaks QRS-T angle. The angle and traditional parameters (Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell indices) were calculated for the LVH group (n=6) and athletes (n=4) and compared to normal limits in respective age groups. Diagnoses were made according to the respective criteria. The spatial peaks QRS-T angle correctly identified LVH 100% of the time and athletes 100% of the time, whereas Sokolow-Lyon identified 83% of LVH and 0% of athletes and Cornell identified 83% of LVH and 25% of athletes. The traditional methods failed to distinguish between the two groups, but the angle was much more precise and resolved ambiguous cases explicitly. Thus, the angle improves the accuracy and accessibility of screenings (by reducing the need for expensive subsequent testing). Implementing the angle in universal screenings would prevent numerous deaths, especially in athletes, and is an innovative and cost-effective way to diagnose LVH.

EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS ON ORAL FLORA
Farhat Alucozai
West Lafayette Junior/Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

Many drugs have gastrointestinal toxicity as a result of interfering with the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. Chemotherapeutic agents in particular are associated with significant toxicity. We evaluated the effects of various standard chemotherapies (melphalan, dexamethasone), novel biological agents (bortezomib, lenalidomide), and investigational agents (parthenolide, andrographolide) on oral flora toxicity. By having healthy donors swab their mouths and then having that bacteria expanded, treated and then analyzed, we were able to conclude whether or not the oral flora was destroyed. Based on OD reading from a spectrophotometer we were able to see that chemotherapeutic drugs have variable effect on different types of oral flora, different bacteria responded differently with the treatment.

ANCHORS AWAY, PART TWO: A CONTINUATION STUDY OF METALLIC VS. BIODEGRADABLE SUTURE ANCHORS
Connor Lewis Hines
Wasatch High School, Heber City, UT

As biodegradable orthopedic hardware becomes increasingly common, it is more important than ever than to fully understand the biomechanical characteristics of each polymer used in these implants. This includes not only the polymer's static pullout strength and the body's reaction to the polymer, but also the characteristics a polymer displays as it degrades over its advertised half-life. This project explores the latter of these characteristics. I studied the rate of degradation of two biodegradable polymers and a titanium alloy over a 6-month simulated in-vitro trial. The suture anchors I used in this study were constructed of PLLA/PGA (poly-L-lactic acid, poly-glycolic acid copolymer), PLLA/PLGA (poly-L-lactic acid, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid copolymer), and titanium alloy 318 (composed of titanium, surgical grade stainless steel, molybdenum, iron, aluminum, and vanadium). These anchors were submerged in a 0.9% medical-grade saline solution in an incubator set to 36.4 degrees Celsius for the duration of the study, conditions that effectively simulate an in-vitro environment. My results show very little change in polymer and titanium strength at the 0 and 3-month test intervals, but apparent degradation and loss of strength in both biodegradable polymers was very obvious at the 6-month interval. However, very little change was seen in the strength of the titanium anchors even after 6 months. In conclusion, I found the advertised half-life of a biodegradable polymer very accurately describes that anchor’s useful life, thereby determining the amount of time each implant can be expected to function safely in the body.

EXPLORING SEQUENCE SIMILARITY BETWEEN IMMUNE-REGULATING GENES, VIRUSES, AND MIRNAS: USING MIR21 AS A MODEL
Mary Olivia Richardson
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been associated with a number of viral triggers, including rotavirus (dsRNA), enterovirus B (ssRNA), rubella (ssRNA), and cytomegalovirus (dsDNA). However, the molecular mechanism of these associations is unknown. Separately, autoimmunity has been associated with a number of microRNAs. The possibility that viral RNA sequences, viral-encoded miRNAs, or endogenous miRNAs fulfill the requirements for targeting immune-regulating gene expression through RNAi mechanisms was investi-gated. The role of miR21 in regulation of PTPN2, PTPN22, and p-ERK1/2 in macrophages was examined through western blotting and real-time RT-PCR. Corresponding mouse gene sequences were compared through bioinformatic analysis. Additionally viruses, human target genes, and miRNAs were compared for sequence similarity. Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR revealed change in target gene protein and mRNA expression partially consistent with the identified bioinformatic matches for mouse genes. Addition-ally, bioinformatic analysis of human sequences identified seed sequence similarity of at least 75% between viruses, human target genes, and miRNAs. This warrants further research of the potential for RNAi to act as a common mechanism for both viral and miRNA involvement in autoimmunity.

WHY ORGANIC? ORGANIC VS. NON ORGANIC FRUIT'S EFFECT UPON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER FLIES REPRODUCTION WITH IMPLICATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH
Arwa Akram
Rutherford High School, Panama City, FL

Due to the recent boost in the organic food industry, it is necessary to understand whether organic or non-organic fruit have different effects upon human health. This was studied by performing an experiment on the Drosophila melanogaster, studying how different experimental media will cause the differences in the levels of reproductions. Organic vegetables, fruits and meat are produced without the use of antibiotics, chemical fertilizers, hormones, pesticides, germ-killing radiation or genetic modification.<br><br>Since human studies are difficult to perform due to ethical and safety issues, Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were chosen to serve as a study group. It would be reasoned that levels of pesticides would correlate with reproductive rates since flies would likely be sensitive to the presence of residual pesticides. Flies would also show a result in a more advantageous time period. <br><br>To do so, 3 categorical experiments were performed. The first experiment monitored any differences in the reproduction of flies when provided with unwashed organic and unwashed non organic food. In the second experiment, both of the fruits were washed. And in the third experiment, only the non organic fruit was washed. The experiment was done over a complete life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster, and consisted of 4 trials for each category. <br><br>It was found that Drosophila melanogaster provided with washed organic fruit had the highest reproduction rate. The non organic fruit, even after being washed for 20 seconds had a far lower reproduction rate. The lowest reproduction occurred in non organic, unwashed fruit vials.

CELLULAR PATHWAYS OF OXIDATION AND INSULIN PRODUCTION IN TYPE I DIABETIC BETA CELLS: WHAT MECHANISMS DOES RB2 ACT THROUGH TO ENHANCE BETA CELL FUNCTION?
Wyatt Brody Horan
The Wheeler School, Providence, RI

The auto-immune disorder, Diabetes (type I and type II), has emerged in recent decades as one of the most pervasive chronic diseases in developing countries today. As the numbers of diabetic patients increase in nations unable to pay for their healthcare, new forms of preventative treatment must be found to ensure the livelihood of millions. Type I diabetes is the result of damaged pancreatic beta cells that are too weak to produce insulin, a vital hormone that regulates metabolism. Oxidation is a leading component of Type I diabetes. It is known that oxidation damages cells so that they are unable to produce insulin. Ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, is an herbal remedy that has been used for millennia to treat the symptoms of Type I diabetes. In particular Rb2, a saponin of ginseng, was used to reverse the effects of diabetes (including decreased oxidation and increased insulin production) in vitro in beta cells. The experiment sought to reaffirm ginseng’s ability to reverse the effects of Type I diabetes and demonstrate which cellular pathway Rb2 works through to decrease oxidation in beta cells and therefore increase insulin production. Using immunohistochemistry, 8 groups containing varying reagents were stained and fluoresced. The results showed Rb2‘s remarkable ability to reverse the effects of Type I diabetes at a most effective concentration of Rb2 of 100uL/mL. The research also determined that Rb2 works through SOD-1 to decrease oxidation and increase insulin production. The experiment yields promising results and furthers the understanding of how ginseng exactly reduces the effects of Type I diabetes in pancreatic beta cells. The findings will help produce a more viable treatment for millions of patients suffering from Type I diabetes throughout the world.

PHYLLANTHUS NIRURI: A HEALING HERB
Kagiso Malar Samuel
South Pacific Academy, Pago Pago, American Samoa, AMERICAN SAMOA

Phyllanthus niruri, commonly called the ‘stone-breaker,’ is known to have antioxidant properties. Hence, this project was undertaken to test and see if Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, is present in P. niruri and to verify its effect on E.coli, a common food-borne bacteria. Further tests for pH value in P. niruri were done to confirm the presence of Ascorbic acid. As preparation for the experiment, the plant extract of P. niruri was made. At the outset, test for Ascorbic acid was done using an indicator (starch solution and iodine). The indicator and plant extract were poured into a test tube in measured volumes and the changes were recorded. Subsequently, the pH test for P. niruri was done using a red cabbage indicator, and the color change was marked. The tests for Ascorbic acid were repeated with orange juice as positive control and water as negative control, and the changes were noted. The loss of the indicator’s original dark purple-blue color showed that P. niruri does indeed contain Ascorbic acid. The color change was different from its water control, which did not show any change in color and similar to that of the orange juice control - almost colorless. The pH of the P. niruri was also found to be acidic, further supporting the presence of Ascorbic acid. Lastly, the strength of Ascorbic acid as an antioxidant in P.niruri was tested by checking its inhibitory effect on E.coli, a gram-negative bacteria. It was found that the whole plant, leaves, stems, and roots included, has an inhibitory effect on E.coli. The resulting petri dishes with the plant extract had an inhibited area in a circle with an average of 12 mm diameter. Subsequent research with related literature proves that Phyllanthus niruri indeed contains antioxidant properties that make it a healing herb.

ALMOND EXTRACT INDUCES DEATH AND MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN HUMAN LEUKEMIC CELLS
Ashley Nicolle Gutierrez
Academia Maria Reina, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Currently there is an alarming increase in the number of people suffering from cancer, in the United States and Puerto Rico, cancer is the second leading cause of death. Treatment for cancer patients involve surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, however, newer interventions are needed for cancer treatment. Recent evidence shows an association between nut consumption and cancer prevention, yet the data are limited to a small set of cancers that do not include cancer of the blood or leukemia. Therefore, it was decided to test the hypothesis that almond extract induces death of acute lymphoblastic leukemia human cells by affecting the function of the mitochondria, the organelles responsible for the generation of cellular energy. To test the hypothesis the human CEM lymphoblastoid cells were exposed to increasing volumes of almond extract and cell concentration and cell viability determined 24, 40, and 72 hours after treatment using the trypan blue exclusion method. It was found that almond extract induced a statistically significant time and dose-dependent decrease in cell number and cell viability compared to control/vehicle treated cells. Next the effects of almond on oxygen consumption of CEM cells were investigated using an oxygen biosensor system. It was found that almond extract significantly delays the oxygen consumption rate of mitochondria without affecting their maximal respiratory rate. The results suggest that mitochondrial function may be important for almond extract-induced leukemic lymphoid cell death.

This study focuses on nuclear medicine and especially on PET-scanning (Positron Emissions Tomography). The study investigates the medical use of radioactive isotopes and the half-life of the three isotopes: flour-18, technetium-99m and gallium-68, which are calculated and measured with a dose calibrator at Nuclear Medicinal Section, Aalborg Hospital. The half life is important when using radioactive isotopes for PET-scanning because the scan must be completed before the isotope has decayed, but at the same time ensuring that the patient is exposed to the least possible radiation. The use of radioactive isotopes and their half-life is discussed in the paper.<br><br>The study investigates PET-scanning using Gallium-68-DOTA-TOC as a trace element. This trace element is used for diagnosing cancer tumors due to its ability to bind to cancer cells and the radiation of the radioactive isotope gallium-68, which is measured by the scan.<br><br>The production of the trace element Gallium-68-DOTA-TOC and the quality control of the product display the high requirements in nuclear medicine. The conclusion to be drawn is that the main function of PET-scanning is diagnosing cancer by means of a radioactive trace element. Gas chromatography (GC) and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used for quality control. These tests show that a synthesis of Ga68-DOTA-TOC can be produced automatically with high quality and the cleanness necessary for human use.

Gymnazium a Stredni Odborna Skola Prelouc, Prelouc, CZECH REPUBLIC

In the frame of our project, we decided to concentrate on the children at the age from six to fifteen. We were interested in the aspect when the major expansion of somatic growth (mid-growth spurt) begins and chosen somatic parameters (body height, body weight, biacromial width, bicristal width, estimate of body fatness based on the skin folds equations). Then we noticed intersexual differences between boys and girls and recognized the important moment, in which the changes in somatic growth between these two sexes occur. We compared our results with older researches and found out, how our population had changed. Our anthropologic research was supported by a simple questionnaire. The respondents were asked about their eating habits, practicing sports, obesity in the respondent´s family. We wanted so that our research pointed out unfortunate situation in the Czech Republic.<br><br> Our main hypothesis, which said that during the last ten years the number of overweight or obese children rose dramatically, and the development and the distribution of the amount of lipids are moving to younger generations, was confirmed. Opinions of many scientists, who say that the obesity of children is a problem of all the population, are right and obesity is not a problem of a few rare cases.

CARBONIC ANHYDRASE IX INHIBITORS: DISCOVERY OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC CANCER AGENTS
Vanna Nga Hovanky, Keyur Mehta, 
James Bowie High School, Austin, TX

Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an enzyme which increases the survival of cancer cells by regulating tumor pH. The purpose of the project was to discover novel inhibitors of CAIX by the means of virtual screening and wet lab methods. <br><br> 86,228 compounds from seven diverse libraries were screened using the binding scores from GOLD and Lipinski’s Rule of 5. Metoprolol, Pentamidine isethionate, and Chembridge compound #7653639 and #7633756 showed predicted binding strength to the active site through favorable interactions of Van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. They followed Lipinski’s Rule of 5 for drug-likeness. Ligation-independent-cloning allowed for the insertion of the CA9 gene into an expression vector. CAIX was expressed, purified, and characterized. Enzyme assays measured the effectiveness of the four compounds in vitro. A microplate reader was used to obtain data. Optical Density at 400 nm over time (mean velocity) showed the rate at which the enzyme functioned. Thus smaller mean velocities indicated CAIX inhibition. Different concentrations of each compound were tested. As the concentration of the four compounds increased from 0.5 µM to 100 µM, the average mean velocities decreased. The average mean velocity of the enzyme without any inhibitors was 2.184 mOD/min. At 100 µM, the top two inhibitors, Chembridge compound #7653639 and #7633756, had an average mean velocity of 1.519 mOD/min and 1.565 mOD/min, respectively. <br><br> Overall the compounds show great promise. Success in this study affirms the importance of virtual screening and may contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic cancer agents. <br><br>

NOVEL BIOACTIVITIES AND MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS OF THE MEDICINAL FUNGUS ANTRODIA CINNAMOMEA AGAINST HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Kuang-Ming Shang, Tzu-Hsuan Su, 
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a precious medicinal fungus endemic to Taiwan which has been used anecdotally as a folk remedy for cancer diseases, diarrhea, hypertension, and hepatoprotection in Asian countries. Breast cancer is one of the top life threatening diseases in women worldwide. The objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacological effect and mechanisms of action of fruiting body extracts of AC against breast cancer cell activity in vitro and in xenograft BALB/c nude mouse system. Three different growing stages of AC fruiting bodies at 3-month (AC-3), 6-month (AC-6) and 9-month (AC-9) were collected and subjected to a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effect against human breast cancer cells T47D(ER+) and MDA-MB-231(ER-), respectively. We observed that the total ethanolic extracts of AC fruiting bodies at different stages dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of T47D cancer cells, with magnitude as AC-3 > AC-6 > AC-9, whereas less effect was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. The AC-3 extract further exhibited inhibition on cell adhesion, migration and metastasis, and induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in T47D cancer cells. The chemical fingerprints of the AC extracts were established using HPLC and various spectral analyses. Two lanostane-type triterpenoids, namely dehydrosulfurenic acid (1) and dehydroeburicoic acid (2) were identified in the AC-3 extract with the content of 42.4% and 41.7%, respectively, which can serve as the index compounds for quality control of the extract. This study provides evidence-based data to support the popularly used traditional medicine A. cinnamomea for breast cancer treatment.

USING ZINC TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT PANCREATIC CANCER
Kelvin Niu, Daniel Park, 
Langley High School, McLean, VA

Pancreatic cancer, known as the “silent killer” because it does not exhibit symptoms in its early stages, is one of the deadliest cancers due to the lack of early detection methods. Recent studies suggested that zinc, an essential trace element and the only metal that is present in all enzyme classes, may play an important role in the development of pancreatic cancer, yet results were conflicting. The purpose of this project was to determine the 1) intracellular zinc levels and 2) the effect of external zinc levels on the growth of pancreatic cancer vs normal epithelial cells. AsPC-1 (cancer) and HEK (normal) cells were cultured in media of varying zinc concentrations and after 48 hours, the cells were stained using Trypan Blue and the numbers of live and dead cells were counted under a microscope. After adding nitric acid to release the intracellular zinc, the zinc concentrations were determined using an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The results showed that the intracellular zinc concentrations were consistently lower in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, pancreatic cancer cells demonstrated a strong resistance to zinc concentration changes in the culture medium. However, in the absence of external zinc, the death rate of cancer cells was significantly (2.5 times) (p = 0.027, alpha=0.05) higher than that of normal cells. These findings are consistent with the discovery of higher levels of zinc transporter proteins in pancreatic cancer cells. If these results are confirmed, zinc can be utilized in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

PARACELLULAR TRANSPORT OF VARIOUS SOLUTES THROUGH AN IN VITRO BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER
Lily Qingyang Cao, Frank Cao, 
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

The purposes of this study was to quantitatively measure and analyze the permeability of an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the bEnd3 cell monolayer consisting of immortalized mouse cerebral endothelial cells to the antibody Immunoglobulin G (IgG), and thus determine the transport pathway that IgG molecules most likely took through the bEnd3 cell monolayer. The bEnd3 cells were first cultured in standard conditions and then seeded into cell monolayers on Transwell inserts. Using an automated fluorometer system, the permeability of the bEnd3 cell monolayer to the IgG particles was measured. According to the findings, the average permeability of the bEnd3 cell monolayer to IgG was 2.20x10-7 ± 4.88x10-8 cm/s. In addition, paracellular transport was found to be the most likely taken transport pathway of IgG molecules. A secondary purpose of this study was to measure the permeability of the bEnd3 cell monolayer to the glucan dextran-70k and compare the measured in vitro data with previously published in vivo data. The in vitro data plotted well against the in vivo data, giving further support to the bEnd3 cell monolayer as a suitable in vitro model of the BBB. More research on the transport pathways of the BBB to IgG and dextran particles would help further elucidate the structure and mechanisms of the blood-brain barrier.

Marlborough High School, Marlborough, MA

The effects of Rhodiola Crenulata root extract on SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cancer cells, particularly in the metastatic ability of the cells, and their susceptibility to radiation is the focus of the research. Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common malignancy found in women, with a survival rate of about 90% for early stage and 30% for advanced cases. The genus Rhodiola has anti-tumorigenic properties and can inhibit metastasis inside cells. The purpose of this experimentation was to measure how much Rhodiola Crenulata changes the migration, proliferation, and death rate of cancer cells.<br><br> A scratch wound assay and a clonogenecity assay were conducted. In the scratch wound assay a micropipette tip was scratched in each of the individual wells in the well plate filled with designated amounts of cancer cells. Regrowth was timed, as to determine the metastatic ability of the cells. The clonogenecity assay consisted of 32 petri dishes that were filled with cells which were half adhered or half suspended within the dish. Sixteen of them were exposed to irradiation and the other 16 were not. The number of colonies per dish was counted. <br><br> It was determined that with the inclusion of Rhodiola Crenulata, the metastatic and proliferative ability of the cells decreased. There were 25-50% fewer colonies per dish in the clonogenecity assay when compared to the control, which was ethanol. Therefore, Rhodiola Crenulata decreases the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and increases the cellular vulnerability to irradiation.

GOING ANTIVIRAL: AN EVALUATION OF PI3 KINASE INHIBITOR LY294002 AS A NOVEL CLASS OF ANTIVIRAL DRUG
Alexander Zhang, David Chen, 
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Current antiviral drugs only target viral genes, which often results in rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral mutants that render the drugs ineffective. An alternative to targeting viral genes is to instead target cellular functions essential for viral replication. Compounds that inhibit such functions may have potential to become antiviral drugs. The cellular phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) family and its associated pathways are vital to many cellular functions, some of which are exploited by viruses for infection and replication. LY294002 is a powerful, specific inhibitor of PI3K. The goal of this project was to evaluate the potential of LY294002 as an antiviral drug. Three experiments were performed in this study. For an initial cytotoxicity assay, cells were treated with various concentrations of LY294002 (20, 40, 60, 80, 100µM) for 24 hours; no significant cytotoxicity was found at or under a concentration of 40µM. Based on this result, a range of 0-60µM was selected for determination of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) on replication of a model coronavirus. It was found that LY294002 was a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication with an IC50 of approximately 20µM. Finally a time course study was conducted, in which LY294002 was added at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post-infection. Results showed that adding the inhibitor earlier provided better inhibition. Thus, it can be concluded that LY294002, which targets a cellular pathway rather than viral genes, can be developed for a novel class of antiviral drugs that will not lead to emergence of drug-resistant viral mutations.

Carcinoma is the most commonly occurring type of cancer in humans. It’s a genetic disease often caused by the mutation of the patient’s p16INK4A gene, a tumor suppressor gene. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the replacement of a mutated p16 gene with the gene wild type will normalize the cell cycle, entirely employing the following virtual labs: PCR from the University of Utah, Electrophoresis from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Principles of Biotechnology from the National Repository of Online Courses Science The following simulation was conducted: Two cell lines were cultured in a tissue culture environment: one with a mutated P16 gene and one with a wild-type p16 gene. The cell lines were examined and compared. Then, the cell line with the mutated gene had the gene extracted using restriction enzymes. Later, the wild type was injected through a lytic virus. A meta-analysis was conducted assessing expected results of the experiment. The results of six researches studying p16 gene function and/or deletion were analyzed statistically using t-test and random effects models, which showed the data not homogenous. These virtual lab results indicate the probability is after injecting a healthy p16 gene, cells and patients have higher rates of survival, thus tumors will be suppressed. A program was constructed using algorithms to measure the amount of tumor formation by inserting certain attributes according to the hypothesis. Further studies can one day lead to the restoring of the p16 gene and the treatment of negative cell division.

LINKING BIOMARKERS TO BEHAVIORS FOR NOVEL EARLY DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, & PREVENTION OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS
Saleem Abdulfattah Aldajani, Majd Alabandi, 
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

Children around the world are currently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) at late ages, solely based on behaviors subsequently exhibited. 82% of autistic children are diagnosed after age three, when G zero phased neurons have ceased development. Therefore, research dictates the necessity of early intervention for the treatment of ASDs. The purpose of this data study research is to develop an early diagnosis method that initiates a strategy for intervention, with the novelty of linking biomarkers, the underlying precursors of any disease, to behaviors, which are currently used in autism diagnosis. Throughout data collection from 35 autistic patients, blood venipuncture, neurophysiological imaging, and behavioral evaluation, figures studied selected biomarkers, based on roles in neurotransmission, and selected behaviors, based on frequency of occurrence. Data analysis revealed correlations between abnormalities in biomarkers and behaviors through examining a stem-scatter plot. Further analysis exhibited a significant overall correlation percentage of 80.92%. Next, abnormality frequencies of biomarkers and behaviors were programmed to produce weighted sums. Ranges of biomarker and behavioral sums displayed no significant difference with a p-value of 0.953, which proves the similarity between both ranges and the efficiency of biomarker diagnosis in comparison to behavioral diagnostic methods. For the justification of both the biomarker approach in autism diagnosis and the biomarker grouping for targeted interventions, neurotransmitters were linked to correlated biomarkers and behaviors through institutional analysis. Thus, the direct application of this research signifies a procedural system that diagnoses autism before age three and implements targeted interventions for autism treatment and prevention.

EVALUATION OF GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN THE CELL-DEATH PATHWAY FOR CHEMOSENSITIVE VS. CHEMORESISTANT CELL LINES
Radhika Angeles Chunduru, Andrew Friedman, 
B Reed Henderson High School, West Chester, PA

The aim of this project was to determine the gene expression pattern that confers resistance to docetaxel, a standard chemotherapeutic agent. We used two cancer cell lines: WiDR and IGROV1. These two cell lines were initially tested for sensitivity to docetaxel in a 72-hr assay by crystal violet staining. Our data showed that WIDR exhibited sensitivity to Docetaxel while IGROV1 was completely resistant. Since the two cell lines exhibited differential sensitivity to docetaxel, we then evaluated the gene expression pattern by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Approximately, 50 genes that are part of the cell death pathway were tested. Our results clearly showed differences in the gene expression profile between the two cell lines. Such differential gene expression suggests that IGROV1 cell line developed resistance to docetaxel by blocking the cell death pathway. It is possible that tumors exhibiting WIDR phenotype may also develop resistance after treatment with docetaxel. To circumvent future resistance, new therapies need to be developed that target these resistant pathways or docetaxel needs to be combined with other drugs targeting this pathway. Data from our biomarker study, presented herein, could potentially aid in patient selection for docetaxel treatment.

INVESTIGATING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN BODY MASS INDEX AND BACTEROIDETES AND FIRMICUTES FREQUENCIES IN THE GUT
Shanawaj Khair, Daniel Arango, 
John Bowne High School, Flushing, NY

Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of obesity in the United States. More than 97 million American adults are either overweight or obese. Recent research suggests that differences in gut bacteria composition may play a role in obesity. Greater frequencies of some bacterial phyla may be associated with obesity because they allow for more efficient extraction of energy from consumed food. For example, differences the frequencies of the phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, have been associated with obesity among several mammalian species. Past research using genetically modified mice suggests that decreased frequencies of Bacteroidetes and increased frequencies of Firmicutes are correlated with increased weight. Our study assessed the correlations between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes frequencies using non-genetically modified lean and obese mice. Quantitative real-time PCR of mice fecal DNA was used to quantify Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes frequencies. Our results indicate that, as weight increased over time, the relative number of Firmicutes chromosomal copies decreased, while relative number of Bacteroidetes chromosomal copies remained constant as weight increased. Currently, fecal samples for two additional trials are being analyzed to verify our results. Although this study investigates the correlation between bacteria frequencies and BMI, it does not imply causation.<br><br><br>

Marine organisms have long been recognized as source of potent therapeutic compounds. In this study, the potential of ink secretion of Dolabella auricularia as novel source of bioactive compounds was examined. Allium cepa genotoxicity test and brine shrimp lethality assay were conducted to assess the toxicity of D. auricularia ink secretion. Thin-layer chromatography and colorimetric reaction tests were used to determine the bioactive compounds present in the secretions.<br><br>Scores for mitotic index (MI) and frequency of abnormal chromosomes peaked at 500 ppm concentration showed values of 59.92 and 7.41, respectively. Gradual decrease in MI scores and abnormal chromosome number were observed at higher concentrations. Genotoxic effect of ink secretion was found effective at concentrations ranging from 500 ppm to 5000 ppm since further cell division was inhibited using these treatments. Significant differences (α 0.01) among the treatments were noted for the MI scores, however, no significant differences (α 0.05) were observed for the frequency of abnormal chromosomes. Lethality assay showed treatment with 100 ppm was the effective lethal concentration (LC50) of the ink secretion with 50% mortality of the brine shrimp population. <br><br>Thin-layer chromatography and colorimetric analyses of the secretion revealed the presence of flavonoids, leucoanthocyanins, saponins, and tannins. These metabolites might be responsible for the observed increase in cell division and genotoxic activity of the ink secretion. Further characterization of D. auricularia secretion is recommended to explore its potential as source of bioactive compounds for the induction of cell division in Allium cepa.

EFFECTS OF CREATINE PHOSPHATE ON AORTIC SMOOTH VASCULAR TISSUE
Thuy-Duyen Cao Nguyen, Jasmine Chien, 
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

Because of creatine's acceptance as a body builder supplement and supposed ability to increase energy production, this experiment focuses on using creatine phosphate, a form of creatine, as a treatment toward aortic arterial aneurysms. This tests whether additional concentrations introduced to tissue will cause cell reorganization and an increase of ATP production. To measure the ATP output and identify cells’ internal reorganization, three major techniques were used: cell culture, cell imagery, and ATP assay. The cell culture introduced 2mM, 5mM, and 8mM concentrations of creatine phosphate to aortic smooth vascular tissue for a period of four days. Cell imagery was used to capture the cell internal structures—microtubules, actin, and DNA—while the ATP assay was utilized to properly measure the concentration of ATP produced by the cell samples. <br><br>From the experiment, it is concluded that the correlation between ATP production and amount of creatine phosphate introduced to the environment depended on the cell’s internal reorganization. The clearest evidence of the cells’ physical alteration lies at the microtubules where these internal structures went from dispersed to clumped and divided at the nucleus. At the 2mM and 5mM sample, the cells were more clumped together than the non-treated sample. Both samples resulted in an increased amount of ATP produced than the accepted average production by aortic cells, suggesting that the clumping of microtubules would contribute to a boost in ATP production. However, the 8mM, where the most microtubule buildup occurred, ATP production declined below the accepted average. Therefore, the 5mM sample was the best concentration that yielded the most ATP because of its optimal amount of conglomeration and dispersion of microtubules.

INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL ASSISTIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR COMPLETE QUADRIPLEGICS
Yaya Chenyue Lu
The Friends' School, Clemes, Hobart, AUSTRALIA

Complete quadriplegics have minimal control over their environment. This project proposed various inexpensive and language-independent methods by which complete quadriplegics could control a wheelchair. <br><br>Two wheelchair control headsets were built. The first detected facial movements; the second timed the length of vocal sounds, both being able to detect a sufficient variety of signals to individually control a wheelchair. To allow these methods to be tested, two wheelchair models were constructed. Initial tests with the components linked by cables proved clumsy, so adding local computing power to the components allowed forming radio links between the headsets and wheelchairs. This proved far more convenient in practice. <br><br>Movements of the nose, eyebrows, nostrils and ears proved measurable; suitable for conversion by the headset computer into radio signals that could be sent to the wheelchairs. Placement of the movement sensors proved critical, but preliminary work connecting these to spectacles seemed promising. Measuring the volume and duration of voice sounds proved straightforward (and relatively insensitive to background noise) when combined with a low-level inexpensive computing element attached to the headset. <br><br> <br><br>It was demonstrated that it was possible for a wheelchair to be controlled by a complete quadriplegic, using either movements of the face or the voice. Testing showed that these were language-independent control systems which used cheap computing elements, able to be used by speakers of any of the 7000 languages available on earth.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) or inflammation of the nasal mucosa is a condition that affects a significant part of the Puerto Rican population. Among some patients, the condition affects their daily routine by decreasing their productivity and overall quality of life. In some extreme cases, ear discomfort and sometimes hearing loss can be a complaint of patients with severe AR. This study was designed to evaluate if there is a relationship between AR and eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), a condition which causes significant ear related complaints. By using a questionnaire developed to measure AR severity of symptoms and a tympanometry test (as an indirect measure of ETD), subjects were evaluated at a local otolaryngology clinic. Both allergic and non-allergic patients were included in the study. Allergy scores and tympanic membrane compliance were tabulated and graphed. Environmental allergen counts were assessed at the time the study was conducted. It was found that as allergic symptoms increase there is a decrease in eardrum mobility. Future experimentation will require a higher population sample to further strengthen this study. This type of assessment can be of importance as treatment effectiveness can be measured by the use of tympanometry in severe cases of AR among the population of Puerto Rico.

THROMBOGENIC ASSESSMENT OF NITINOL ALLOYS AND THEIR HEMOCOMPATIBILITY
Ashwin Mahadev Bhat
John A. Ferguson Senior High School, Miami, FL

Implant devices serve various purposes and functions in the body. Some of the materials implant devices are currently built with can be detrimental to the human body, by way of forming clots or thrombus when in contact with blood.<br><br>Therefore, it is necessary to test the hemocompatibility, including the degree of thrombogenicity, of new materials that could be used in an implant device.<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to test whether nitinol tantalum and Nitinol chromium are better implant materials than what is currently used, which include Teflon and stainless steel. The hypothesis was that the two metal alloys would have a lower thrombogenicity than the materials in current use. Testing was done using a flow chamber setup to emulate the conditions of human intravenous blood flow. The fluorescent dye, mepacrine, was used to observe the adherence of<br><br>platelets to the surface of each material.<br><br>By observing the amount of fluorescent platelets on each of the materials, it could be seen that Nitinol tantalum and Nitinol chromium alloys both have significantly less platelets adhering to their surface than Teflon. Platelets adhesion on Teflon was 5 to 8 times greater than that on Nitinol tantalum and Nitinol chromium alloys, indicating a low thrombogenicity of the latter. Thus, it was concluded that Nitinol tantalum and Nitinol chromium would be more ideal for implants than currently used materials.

IDENTIFYING NOVEL DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (DNMT1) SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS FOR CANCER TREATMENT YEAR TWO: HYBRID STRUCTURE AND LIGAND-BASED VIRTUAL SCREENING
Alexander William Forsyth
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

When overexpressed, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) can silence tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), leading to carcinogenesis. Consequentially, DNMT1 inhibition has effectively treated multiple types of cancer, including prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers. To predict inhibitors, structure-based virtual screening is commonly used, but it is very resource and time consuming. Therefore, a new hybrid of structure and ligand-based virtual screening was developed for more efficient inhibitor identification. Structure-based screening was performed to predict top DNMT1 inhibitors; 2-D structural similarity searches were then performed on these to find analogous compounds. The similar compounds were scored in an identical structure-based screening, and the process was repeated. The top 3000 compounds of the 15806 hybrid-screened had binding affinities (lower affinities predict better inhibitors) between -11.6 and -8.1; average -8.81; median -8.7 kcal/mol. No current DNMT1 inhibitor had a binding affinity below -8.7 kcal/mol; thus, 1500 compounds were predicted to be more effective. Meanwhile, the top 3000 compounds from structure-based screenings of 67723 had range -9.7 to -6.3; average -6.84; median -6.7 kcal/mol. The new hybrid method was found to be up to 1450 times more efficient than structure-based screening at finding low energy compounds. The effectiveness of these compounds compared to current inhibitors warrants future investigation, including cell line testing, to assess the compounds’ potential as DNMT1 inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drug candidates. In addition, this new method of drug design can be used for more efficient drug development not only for DNMT1 and cancer, but for other targets and diseases including HIV, Alzheimer’s, and multiple others.

DEVELOPING A LIGAND-SPECIFIC HIGH DIELECTRIC STRENGTH DRUG MODEL FOR DEMYELINATION DISORDERS USING LUTJANUS BUCCANELLA IN SITU, YEAR III
Mohan Sai Ravi
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, FL

Demyelination disorders are prevalent in an aging society. Current theory suggests autoimmune responses cause myelin decay, reducing neurotransmission and hence mobility. The goal is to create a functional myelin substitute that accounts for electrical and chemical neurorehabilitation.<br><br>This experiment tested the efficacy of a) glycerol allyl ether formerly selected for both biocompatibility and dielectric strength that demonstrated increased neurotransmission, b) to test a proposed mechanism to anchor drug to myelin and reversibly to Calcium channel, and c) to verify that dielectric property wasn't compromised.<br><br>In phase I, using Lollingucula brevis (squid) nerve tissue in vitro, glycerol-2-allyl ether produced significant neurotransmission improvement within human tolerance of 20%. In phase II, glycerol was linked with T-cell protein (alpha m beta 2 integrin) and Kinase A using Manganese (II) Chloride, optimized at 1.0 micrograms per microliter. The alpha m beta 2 integrin and Kinase A are endogenous proteins that bind T-cells to myelin surface MBP protein and instigate chemical nuerotransmission via Ca2+ channels. In phase III, modified glycerol-alpha m beta 2 was introduced in situ to cadaveric L. buccanella nerve, bringing attached glycerol-2-allyl ether into myelin surface and localized charge to terminal calcium channels.<br><br>In conclusion, bound glycerol-1-kinase A-2-allyl ether-3-alpha m beta 2 complex created a 90% increase in electrical neurotransmission exceeding the 50% increase observed using glycerol-allyl ether only, and did so with specific surface attachment. This project yields potential palliative treatment for multiple sclerosis & PNS based demyelination. It also suggests a new approach to treatment by replacement of myelin with artificial materials.

GENETIC ANALYSIS OF ORAL PERIODONTAL PATHOGENS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC VASCULAR DISEASE
Niyanthesh A. Reddy
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

Periodontal Disease is a chronic oral infection which has a strong correlation with the development of Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease (ASVD) is secondary to buildup of plaque, blocking the blood flow leading to fatal heart attacks, stroke, and death. Plaque build-up can be aggravated by the endocytosis of oxidized LDL (ApoE receptor) by macrophages, within the sub-endothelial layer of the artery. This research aims to identify the genetic link between Periodontal Disease and the immune responses leading to the progression of Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease. The aortic tissues of mice infected with four periodontal pathogens and control ApoE knockout mice were isolated for their DNA and RNA, which was provided to the student for further genetic analysis. The DNA was used for 37-42 PCR reactions using primers from bacterial 16s rDNA and the amplified DNA was analyzed through Agarose Gel Electrophoresis. The isolated RNA is purified to mRNA and converted to cDNA through a reverse transcription protocol PCR and subsequent micro arrays are performed to understand the up-regulation and down-regulation of aortic genes in relevance to ASVD. The development of ASVD is due to the transcription of specific pro-atherogenic genes as shown in the up-regulation of genes for blood clotting, cholesterol buildup, inflammation, and endothelial malfunction. Results from DNA Gel Electrophoresis of ApoE-/-mice infected with T. Denticola and F. Nucleatum bacterial strains show significantly larger DNA size than DNA from control mice. This indicates there is underlying genetic recombination by the insertion of foreign transposable genetic material from the bacterial plasmid to host cell DNA where pro-atherogenic genes are up-regulated.

KILLER PRODUCE! YEAR TWO STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF GARLIC ON GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME
McKenzie Mayo Cameron
Martin County High School, Stuart, FL

Glioblastoma Multiforme is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor and has poor survival rates. The tumor is frequently resistant to conventional cancer therapies and is difficult to treat. Last year I evaluated a range of fruits and vegetables and found that there was an unknown compound in garlic that was highly effective at killing the U87 Glioblastoma Multiforme cell line. This year I wanted to start the process of determining the compound in garlic responsible for killing U87 cells. A fresh garlic extract was prepared which reproduced last year’s data, killing over 99% of the tumor cells within 48 hours. The chemicals within the garlic extract were bound to a solid phase chromatography column and sequentially eluted with water (to elute highly polar compounds) and solutions containing increasing amounts of methanol (to elute increasingly hydrophobic compounds). The fractions corresponding to polar compounds were capable of killing U87 cells. The compounds were also diluted to determine the dosage at which they were effective. Higher percentages of the compound were more effective, but lower dosages of highly polar compounds also proved to be effective

HEMODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS IN ARTERIAL NETWORKS WITH ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Aprotim Cory Bhowmik
Parkview High School, Lilburn, GA

Every seven seconds, someone in the United States suffers from myocardial infarction (heart attack). The most common cause of heart attack—and the leading cause of death in the United States—is Coronary Artery Disease, which usually results from atherosclerosis (plaque buildup). Atherosclerosis (or stenosis) reduces the effective diameter of an artery, thereby decreasing the blood flow rate and increasing the pressure gradient. The most common treatment for atherosclerosis is percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stent implantation, and over three million people worldwide undergo stent implantation every year. However, for the standard cylindrical stent, an abrupt diameter change occurs between the stent and the artery; this causes significant pressure gradient to develop at the two ends of the stent. By developing a mathematical model to simulate blood flow through arteries, the researcher designed a novel stent configuration that provides a gradual diameter transition between the stent and the artery and reduces the pressure gradient across the stent by over 50%. In addition, a novel concept of induced stenosis was developed based on modeling of the hemodynamic interactions between interconnected arteries. Results of this research indicate that in an arterial network, the flow rates in the arteries distal to an atherosclerosis can be enhanced by inducing controlled stenoses in selected branches of the network, thereby restoring and regulating blood flow in impaired patients. The novel stent configuration and the ‘flow regulator’ concept have the potential to significantly decrease the number of cases of myocardial infarction, thereby saving millions of lives.

COMBINATIONS OF IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE INHIBITORS AND LYMPHODEPLETION TO INDUCE MYELOMA REJECTION
Dominique Helen Tlomak
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, U.S.A.

Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm characterized by destructive bone lesions. Without treatment, patients rarely survive for more than 6-12 months. Current therapies are non-curative. Successful treatment will require a versatile approach incorporating drug therapy, immunotherapy and novel strategies explored in this study. T-cells are considered crucial immune cells in fighting cancer. When myeloma cells are present, T-cells express proteins called immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, TIM1, TIM3, LAG3, 2B4, BTLA) that are involved in normal immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. Cancers have found ways of co-opting these proteins to their advantage to turn off the T-cells. Mice and patients with multiple myeloma after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have an increased percentage of myeloma-reactive T-cells that express PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1). However, these cells are dysfunctional due to their encounter with myeloma cells that express the ligand for PD-1, PD-L1. In the first phase of this study it was determined that when low dose total body irradiation was combined with an antibody that blocks PD-1 from binding PD-L1, myeloma rejection was established with significant success. Next, an extensive phenotypic analysis (flow cytometry) of bone marrow and spleen from myeloma-bearing mice at several time points was done to examine the presence of immune checkpoint proteins and immune suppressive cells. Since PD-1, 2B4, LAG3, and TIM3 were the most prominent immune checkpoint proteins on the T-cells, myeloma bearing mice were treated with low dose total body irradiation and antibodies that block these proteins. It was found that a combination treatment blocking both PD-1 and TIM3 was most effective, as myeloma was rejected in 100% of these mice.

AUTISM IN FRUIT FLIES: BEHAVIOR OF DROSOPHILA WITH A MUTATED HOMER GENE
Elise Nicole Paietta
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH

An important area of autism research is the identification of genetic contributions to this brain disorder. Recently a new candidate human gene involved in autism, Homer1, has been identified from DNA analysis of glutamate signaling pathway genes in a population of autistic individuals. An approach to confirm or disprove the connection of a particular mutated gene to a neurological problem is to study a mutant version of the gene in Drosophila. The hypothesis that mutation of the Drosophila Homer gene would result in autistic behavior was tested. Initial testing showed that Homer mutant flies had essentially normal phototaxis and chemotaxis general behavioral responses. To look for the presence of autism-related behaviors, a test for social interaction was devised where two flies were separated in a chamber by a mesh screen and the behavior of the test subject fly was monitored. The time the test subject was nearby the other fly was scored and used as a measure of social interaction. Homer mutant flies showed substantial impairment in the social interaction test in that they performed at only 10% of the level seen in wild-type. This finding represented the first demonstration that mutating the Homer gene can result in an alteration in social interaction. R-baclofen, which is being tested in human autism clinical trials, was administered to Homer and wild-type flies. The social interaction test performance in R-baclofen-treated Homer flies improved to 73% of that seen in the wild-type, suggesting that it may be useful for comparable human applications.

THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF ROASTED VIGNA RADIATA, COFFEE ARABICA AND ORYZA SATIVA ON BLOOD COAGULATION IN VITRO
Bradley Tobillo Saunders
Holy Infant Academy, Calapan City, PHILIPPINES

Applying pressure as first-aid can stop bleeding of skin cuts and wounds in 2- 3 minutes. Any delay in clotting can increase blood loss and the rate of wound infection. This study sought to determine the synergistic effect of coffee bean (CB), mung bean (MB), and rice grain (RG) in blood clotting cascades of a normal human blood sample.<br><br> <br><br> Test plant materials were roasted in medium heat for five minutes and were ground to powder using a blender. Each test plant material was dissolved in 10mL of purified water heated at approximately 50゜C in proportions of 50%, 30% and 10% concentrations. Then, 50µL of individual extract and their combinations which are CBMB, CBRG, MBRG, all in 1:1 ratio and CBMBRG in 1:1:1 ratio, were added consecutively to cuvettes with a healthy plasma sample and were individually analyzed using a photo-optic coagulometer.<br><br> The test plant materials and their combinations at 30% and 10% concentrations displayed +++.+ result, which suggests that clotting was too long to detect. However at 50% concentration, the combinations of CBMB showed 167.7sec, MBRG showed 99.8sec and CBMBRG showed 16.7sec.<br><br> With 1.7sec difference to the standard coagulation time, the combination of CBMBRG at 50% concentration can initiate clotting cascades and therefore be an effective as first aid treatment to stop bleeding. This further implies that it can have the potential role in the treatment of dengue hemorrhagic fever and management of other coagulation disorders.

YEAR THREE: THE ROLE OF VARIOUS HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS AND AMYLOID-BETA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Meenakshi Bose
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses, resulting in gross atrophy of affected brain regions. AD is a protein-misfolding disease, caused by aggregation of abnormally folded Beta-Amyloid (ABeta). My goal is to figure out how to degrade ABeta and how this is applicable in treatments for AD. In Year One, I identified that monkey kidney (COS-1) cells have a mechanism for degrading ABeta that brain (SH-SY5Y) cells don’t. In Year Two, by Mass Spectrometric analysis of ABeta native complexes, I identified proteins Ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1), Heat Shock Protein 56 (HSP56), and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) associated with ABeta. Now, I hypothesize these 3 proteins identified may have a potential role in degrading ABeta and alongside chemicals Nicotine and Genistein, their expression should increase, in turn decreasing ABeta expression.<br><br>To test my hypothesis, I performed Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments targeting UBQLN1, HSP70, HSP56, and ABeta to understand protein associations. I then incubated SH-SY5Y cells with Nicotine/Genistein at various concentrations, and analyzed on western blot using ABeta, UBQLN1, and HSP70 as well as Acetylcholinesterase and Glutamate Receptor antibodies to better understand the activity of Acetylcholine and Glutamate, since it is thought that abnormal levels of these neurotransmitters are behind many symptoms of AD. <br><br>I observed that ABeta was associated with UBQLN1 and HSP70 and that HSP70 was associated with UBQLN1 and ABeta. With both sets of experiments with Nicotine and Genistein, I observed decreased expression of ABeta as well as increased expression of HSP56 and HSP70 with Nicotine, suggesting a possible role, while UBQLN1 expression also decreased, contrary to my original hypothesis of Genistein increasing expression. Nicotine and Genistein were able to regulate levels of Acetylcholine and Glutamate by inhibiting Acetylcholinesterase and Glutamate Receptors. Overall, Nicotine and Genistein, alongside Heat Shock Proteins 56&70, show great potential in treating AD.

DEFINING THE MECHANISMS OF ASPIRIN IN CANCER PREVENTION
Andrew Liu
Lakeridge High School, Lake Oswego, OR

Aspirin is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug whose effects are mediated through the inhibition of Cyclooxygenases (Cox). More recently, epidemiological studies have shown that it has the beneficial effect of preventing human cancers. Cox inhibition has been suggested as the mechanism for its tumor suppression effects. However, this stance has been refuted by the fact that Cox knock-out mice mice developed as many tumors as wild-type mice did in an inflammation-induced colon cancer model. This indicates that Cox inhibition is not the major factor foraspirin-mediated tumor suppression. <br><br>In an effort to identify potential targets of aspirin, I screened protein structure databases to identify aspirin-associated proteins in oncogenic signal transduction pathways using the molecular docking program Patchdock. I kappa B Kinase 2 (IKK2), an essential component in the NF-kappaB pathway, was identified as an aspirin-associated protein. This result was confirmed through evaluating the effect of aspirin on the kinase activity of IKK2 by measuring phosphorylated IkappaB in cells treated with TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule. Aspirin inhibited IkappaB phosphorylation in a dosage dependent manner. On the contrary, aspirin enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK, a pro-apoptotic protein that is also induced by TNF-alpha. Furthermore, aspirin induced cells undergoing apoptosis in conjunction with TNF-alpha treatment.<br><br>Given that TNF-alpha is a key inflammatory player essential for carcinogenesis, the results from this experiment show that aspirin acts like a molecular switch, which turns the carcinogenic effect of inflammation into a signal for tumor cell death, thus providing a novel mechanism for aspirin-mediated tumor suppression.

ALPHA-ALUMINA NANOPARTICLES ACTIVATE THE NALP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1B PRODUCTION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC CANCER VACCINATION
Amber Tang
Lakeridge High School, Lake Oswego, OR

Nanotherapeutics play an increasing role in cancer research and the development of an effective vaccine adjuvant. These adjuvants aim to increase the efficiency and ability of vaccines to induce an effective immune response within the body. There are currently no viable vaccine adjuvants capable of inducing both a humoral and cell-mediated response and the mechanisms by which vaccine adjuvants function are not well understood. a-Al2O3 nanoparticles have previously been shown to induce a T-cell response through autophagy dependent cross presentation while activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome has been identified as an adjuvant mechanism of aluminum compounds for an efficient antibody immune response. Here, a-Al2O3 NPs in DC2.4 cells in vitro were found to induce autophagy and activate the Nalp3 inflammasome with IL-1b signaling. a-Al2O3 NPs delivered antigens via the autophagosome and activated the Nalp3 inflammasome inducing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b, a proposed mechanism for antibody recruitment. These results suggest a-Al2O3 NPs to be a promising vaccine adjuvant capable of stimulating both a humoral and cell-mediated immune response for development of an effective therapeutic cancer vaccination.

PROGRAMMABLE MULTIPLEXED IMMUNOSENSOR FOR RAPID CARDIAC DIAGNOSTICS
Andy Tran
Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

Early detection and rapid diagnostic strategies are urgently needed to combat cardiovascular disease—the world’s leading killer. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods, specifically for acute myocardial infarction(AMI)—the most lethal cardiac event—are subject to misdiagnosis and severe delay. To combat this issue, I developed a microfluidic immunosensor that rapidly diagnoses AMI by detecting a multiplexed array of cardiac biomarkers (cTnI, CK-MB, Myo, and NT-proBNP). To form the sensor core of the sandwich-type immunoassay (cAb-Ag-dAb), 2% cross-linked agarose beads were synthesized to fluoresce upon attachment of AlexaFluor-488 conjugated detecting antibodies specific to each biomarker. Using 3D CAD software and xurography techniques, I subsequently designed and fabricated a microfluidic platform (made out of inexpensive plastic film Polyethylene terephthalate) that is able to process blood serum and house the sensor core—thereby integrating the entire diagnostic procedure in one device. Processing blood serum that contains a cocktail of cardiac biomarkers, immunosensor was shown to achieve ng/ml detection limits with only 100uL of sample in less than 20 minutes (compared to the milliliter sample requirement and several-hours long assay of conventional diagnosis). Limits of detection for cTnI, CK-MB, Myo, and NT-proBNP, are 0.51ng/mL, 0.40ng/mL, 0.48ng/mL, and 2.08ng/mL respectively—consistent with clinical cut-off values recommended by the American Heart Association. When compared to clinical analyzers, average R2 value was .993—demonstrating excellent correlation to the accuracy of commercial systems. This cheap, rapid, and simple-to-use immunosensor demonstrates great potential to bring unprecedented improvement to the paradigm of cardiac diagnostics.

THE SWEATY CANAL
Destin Samuel Stratton
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

The amputee of today has plenty of innovations available for state of the art prosthesis. From myoelectric arms for greater articulation to new blade leg prosthetics for enhanced running the choices in prosthetics has become great. But there are pieces of the prosthetic equation that have been over looked. One of these is the way the prosthesis sits against the skin. <br><br>When an amputee first puts on his prosthetic he must first slide on a silicone liner. This liner is used to help cushion the leg and cut down on friction. The problem is with the silicone liners. The liner itself acts as a backwards wet suit, trapping sweat and skin debris within the liner itself. This can cause several problems. Skin infections result from the excellent media the warmth and wet environment provides for bacterial growth. <br><br>So to combat this problem I have implemented two possible adaptations of the liners to alleviate the sweat build up. First I have created small canal like ridges in the interior of the liner itself. This acts as a wick for the sweat and guides the moisture to the opening at the bottom of the liner. Secondly, I provided a small vacuum pump to pull the moisture through the ridges and out the liner.

SOMATOSTATIN TYPE 3 RECEPTORS MEDIATE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST SEIZURES
Ari Shi Gao
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Worldwide, 65 million people are affected by epilepsy, a neurological disorder caused by hyperactive neurons and characterized by repeated seizures. 40% of these epilepsy cases will be completely resistant to all antiepileptic drugs, largely because current antiepileptics are limited to targeting Na+ channels, Ca2+ channels, and/or GABA receptors. This study aims to diversity the current antiepileptic drug target selection by evaluating the potential antiepileptic effects of the inhibitory somatostatin type 3 receptor (SSTR3) during seizure. I propose to test the hypothesis that SSTR3 receptors mediate strong anti-epileptic effects. The investigation will have three sequential phases. In Phase 1, I observed and compared previously collected video-recordings of behavioral convulsions after kainic acid administration in wildtype mice and genetically modified SSTR3 knockout mice. I showed that the presence of the SSTR3 receptor mitigates behavioral seizure severity. In Phase 2 and 3, I performed immunofluorescence microscopy on previously-collected brain tissue samples, and found that SSTR3 also reduced seizure-associated astrogliosis and neuron stress. Finally, by comparing seizure progression in Phases 1, 2, and 3, I showed that the SSTR3 receptor’s antiepileptic effect is normally dormant, activating in response to seizure onset. In sum, my data demonstrates that SSTR3 does indeed mediate an antiepileptic effect and likely does this by targeting the very neurons that are hyperactive and cause seizures. This study names the SSTR3 receptor as a promising candidate for an anti-epileptic drug target. If created, SSTR3-targeted antiepileptic drugs will constitute an entirely new class of antiepileptics, and may be able to eliminate previously untreatable seizures.

CLICK IT AND SAVE IT: COLORIMETRIC ANALYSIS OF RETINOBLASTOMA-LINKED LEUKOCORIA IN DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS
Linda Ren
Midway High School, Hewitt, TX

Every year, millions of preventable deaths result from a late diagnosis. The purpose of this experiment is to develop a photographic tool to verify the presence and severity of retinoblastoma in a subject through the analysis of leukocoric ("white-eye") pupils in terms of the concentration of hue, saturation, and value in order to lesson the number of these deaths. In order to achieve this purpose, a control group with donated photos of nine children diagnosed with retinoblastoma, totaling over 7,400 photos, was established. The control group's data determined and defined that leukocoric pupils had a saturation less than or equal to 0.60, a value greater than or equal to 0.50, and a hue of nearly equivalent quantities. Afterwards, over 10,000 photos with a sign of leukocoria were collected from the time period’s most popular search engines and social websites to test for actual leukocoria. The images were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS5 software, and then exported to a programmed Microsoft Excel file that converted the Red-Green-Blue color model to a Hue-Saturation-Value color model for data collection. The analysis of the data showed that the leukocoric pupils ranged within the boundaries set by the control group, which proved the hypothesis that a quantified scale of leukocoria would verify the presence and severity of retinoblastoma to be true. With this preliminary step, the development of a cheaper, more efficient, and extremely accessible disease detection software will follow in the near future.

SEEKING A CURE: NATURAL ESTROGEN RECEPTOR BETA IN THE TREATMENT OF THERAPY RESISTANT BREAST CANCER CELLS
Jocelyn Elizabeth Hernandez
Robert E. Lee High School, San Antonio, TX

The inability to efficiently combat metastasis makes breast cancer preclude homeostasis. Current cancer treatments such as Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), lead to cancerous cell resistance and human system weakening. A novel therapy for breast cancer includes natural compounds that have not induced cell resistance such as S-Equol. The purpose of this study was to determine the compound's capability of triggering tumor suppression. Therefore, it was hypothesized that upon different levels of S-Equol treatment the appearance of therapy resistant breast cancer cells would be inhibited and substantially decreased. The experiments involved MCF7, MCF7 PELP1, and MCF7 Tamoxifen resistant cell lines. The control cell lines did not receive S-Equol treatment and were cultured in the absence of estrogen/tamoxifen (negative control) as well as with estrogen/tamoxifen (positive control). The independent variable for this study was the S-Equol treatment, while the dependent variables centered around the percentage of surviving cells, apoptotic markers, potential inhibition of cell growth and proliferation rate. Each experiment had various trials of cell lines with different doses of S-Equol (100um, 200um, and 400um). Data was gathered by an MTT Assay and a Colony Formation Assay. Proliferation rates, as shown through the MTT Assay, were substantially decreased with the second highest dose treatment of S-Equol in all cell lines. Results from the Colony Formation Assay highlighted a decrease in survival rate of all the tested cell lines. In conclusion, the data supports that upon S-Equol treatment, the proliferation of cells and metastatic potential is mitigated.

LINKING CATARACTS TO CANCER: THE DIAGNOSIS OF A NOVEL ONCOPROTEIN TO SIGNAL BREAST CANCER, WITH SUPPRESSION USING RHODIOLA CRENULATA ROOT EXTRACT
Gregory John Konar
Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science, Worcester, MA

Alpha-basic crystallin and its associated gene CRYAB were studied for potential oncogenic activity in MDA-MB-231 basal-like breast cancer cells under conditions of elevated stress with the inclusion of Rhodiola crenulata root extract. It was hypothesized that the protein will exhibit oncogenic activity in the stressed breast cancer cells and not in the normal immortalized cell line control, and the Rhodiola crenulata extract will suppress the protein. Proteins were lysed from the cell lines, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred via Western Blot. An assay was performed to determine protein concentrations by blocking them with an initial anti ab-crystallin antibody followed by a secondary anti rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP. They were then exposed using a GBox exposure machine. The protein was shown to be specific to only the breast cancer cells, and it had a 386% lower concentration in the MDA-MB-231 cells than in the normal cells. Rhodiola crenulata root extract showed marginal suppressive abilities, with the proteins being suppressed approximately 17% in both cell lines. However, the Rhodiola induced phosphorylation in ab-crystallin, suggesting that the extract could induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The down regulation of the alpha-basic crystallin in basal-like breast cancer cells suggests that the protein is a feasible target for oncogenic activity in cancer, and that it should be investigated in poor clinical outcomes.

TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIPOSOMAL NANOPARTICLE DELIVERY OF OXYBUTYNIN TO REDUCE BLADDER SPASMS
Adrian Erik Haber
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

This project utilized a novel isolated pig bladder model to test the effectiveness of the delivery of liposomal nanoparticles directly into the bladder for the treatment of overactive bladder (bladder spasms), a disorder that effects over 39 million adults in the U.S. The current treatment of with oral medications is associated with distressing side effects. <br><br>For each bladder, a baseline pressure vs. volume curve was established. Next, Carbachol (a chemical that induces bladder contractions) was instilled and the pressure measured every minute for 10 minutes. After washing with saline and measuring the subsequent pressures, the bladder was instilled with Oxybutynin (a smooth muscle relaxant), either as the free drug or contained in liposomal nanoparticles and the pressures were again measured at 1-min intervals. The measurements with saline and Carbachol were repeated to determine the effectiveness of the Oxybutynin solutions. The same procedures were completed on separate bladders with saline (no Oxybutynin) as controls.<br><br>Isolated pig bladders harvested < 6 hours before testing demonstrated measurable contractile properties. Both free Oxybutynin and nanoparticle-bound drug were equally effective in reducing bladder pressures. One bladder with a pathologic outlet obstruction showed a hyperactive contractile response to Carbachol and was equally responsive to Oxybutynin.<br><br>Nanoparticle-bound Oxybutynin was as effective as the free drug in reducing bladder pressures. The free Oxybutynin solution used in this experiment is not approved for human use so formulating the drug in liposomal nanoparticles may allow the currently available Oxybutynin to diffuse into bladder tissue and more effectively reduce bladder spasms.<br><br>

PSEUDOMONAS A. INFECTIONS IN THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS LUNG: THE INHIBITION OF BIO-ENCAPSULATED PATHOGENS WITHIN SIMULATED CYSTIC FIBROSIS CONDITIONS
Jenna Pauline Hartley
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO

Microbial infections associated with biofilms, have over time become difficult to treat using conventional therapy. This has prompted researchers to identify alternatives, and plant products have gained widespread interest in this regard. Research on natural products as antimicrobial agents has almost exclusively focused on the effects of these agents against planktonic micro-organisms. However, the biofilm forms that are more resistant to antimicrobial agents, and therefore more difficult to control, remain largely unexplored. The effect of Terminalia Chebula, Echinacea dissolved in alcohol as well as in a non-alcoholic solution, and m. Piperita (Peppermint oil), on the development of microbial biofilms of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was researched in this study. The salient point of this project is to measure the inhibition of the biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed within extremely viscous conditions that mimic an environment of a cystic fibrosis lung using an artificial mucus. The anti-microbial properties of the herbal extracts will be investigated thoroughly to test the hypothesis that they inhibit the microbial and biofilm growth. The biofilm of Pseudomonas a. will be analyzed using a spectrophotometer to quantify the data. The agent demonstrating the highest inhibition of the biofilm was m. Piperita. This agent was able to surpass the antimicrobial capabilities of standard antibiotic treatment in a non-mucus environment and parallel effectiveness in a mucus environment. The reduction of biofilm biomass using plant extracts shows potential in the development of medicinal products that will prevent microbial adhesion thus reducing the incidence of infections associated with biofilm formation.

MICROGLIAL REACTION IN AD: FRIEND OR FOE? A STUDY OF TBI IN AD
Lena Jane Ransohoff
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TBI would induce inflammation and accelerate the development of AD pathology in transgenic mice. <br><br>Methods: We studied R1.40 transgenic mice, with a genomic copy of mutant human Amyloid Precursor Protein that results in AD-like brain pathology and cognitive deficits. Two-month old R1.40 and control non-transgenic (non-Tg) mice received fluid-percussion TBI. We evaluated lesion size, microglial reaction (to assess inflammation) and behavior, using motor function, memory and learning tests. <br><br>Results: Three days post-injury, all TBI mice showed motor deficits, which resolved over time. Lesion sizes were equal in non-Tg and R1.40 mice. Surprisingly, microglial reaction to TBI was greater in non-Tg mice both acutely and chronically. Also, R1.40 mice showed less learning deficit than did non-Tg mice 120 days post-injury. <br><br>Conclusions: We modeled the interaction between genetics (R1.40 mice) and TBI in AD pathogenesis. Two surprises emerged: microglia in R1.40 mice showed blunted response to TBI even at two months of age. Blunted microglial response produced less memory/learning deficit on water-maze testing. We propose that impaired microglia revealed in this TBI study contribute later on to AD pathogenesis.

SELECTIVE OLIGODENDROCYTE APOPTOSIS AS A MODEL FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Ingrid Nieves Zippe
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

A neurodegenerative disease involves the progressive degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) and results in irreparable functional deficits. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally been characterized as a disease of autoimmune origin because extensive T lymphocyte infiltration is observed in late-stage patient tissue. However, a growing body of evidence has emerged in support of an alternative theory that the original insult in MS is degenerative and is then followed by an autoimmune reaction. To study the CNS response to primary insult, a transgenic mouse model was engineered in which selective oligodendrocyte apoptosis was induced by a caspase 9 -mediated reaction. Oligodendrocytes expressing the transgenic caspase decreased by 70.6% in experimental animals when compared to control animals (p=0.0009). Myelination was reduced 46.8% and axonal prevalence was decreased 38.2% in experimental animals when compared to control animals (p=0.04; p=0.04). Two weeks after initial insult, full recovery of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and axons was observed. Though macrophages and interleukin 8, actors intimately involved in immune modulation, were both up-regulated in experimental tissue four days after insult, no adaptive T cell infiltration was found. The inducible caspase 9 mouse model for oligodendrocyte apoptosis holds promise for the study of MS as a disease of degenerative origin. The model may facilitate identification of precise mechanisms of CNS repair and may expand on our knowledge of the oligodendrocyte as a unique CNS cell type.

THE EFFECT OF ANTI-APOPTOTIC GENES ON IMMUNE MEDIATED CELL DEATH IN CANCER CELLS
Sarah Jane Gilbert McArthur
Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne, AUSTRALIA

Cancer is a highly prevalent disease that causes immense suffering and loss in societies around the world. This investigation explored the use of immune mediated cell death for cancer treatment. A gene, BCL2, that commonly malfunctions in various cancers was examined. When the BCL2 gene is overexpressed, programmed cell death (apoptosis) is inhibited due to the overproduction of BCL2 protein. As a result, BCL2 overexpressing cancer cells become resistant to immune attack. It was hypothesized that a pro-apoptotic drug (BH3 mimetic: ABT-737) could be used to overcome the resistance of cancerous cells to immune attack, thus utilizing the immune system for cancer treatment. Two types of cell death assays were performed in order to measure the death of cancer cells exposed to immune proteins and enzymes. The first method used cell membrane integrity as a means of measuring cell death while the second used cell morphology to indicate death. It was found that cancer cell death was reduced from 97% to 10% due to the overexpression of anti-apoptotic gene, BCL2. Most importantly, it was found that cancer cell death was increased three fold as a result of the introduction of the pro-apoptotic drug, ABT-737. This has the potential to be an effective form of drug treatment that is not only able to destroy cancerous cells, but is able to utilize the body’s own naturally existing defense mechanisms for minimal harm to healthy cells.

PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE AGAINST HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, TYPE 3
Tzu-Hung Ho
National Taichung First Senior High School, Taichung, CHINESE TAIPEI

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), one of the most common ataxias worldwide, is caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat located in the N-terminal coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Alleles of the ATXN3 gene that carry 13–44 CAG-trinucleotide repeats are present in normal individuals. Contrariwise, alleles with a CAG triplet repeat number of >50 are present in patients with SCA3. It is known as a dynamic mutation of trinucleotide repeat sequences of 63-85 of CAG, leading to form inclusion bodies in neuronal cells in the brain which is caused by polyQ. The present studies showed that EGCG can protect the apoptosis of SCA3 cell line by reducing the oxidative stress mediated by increasing the expression of Hsp70, Hsp60, and Bcl-2, but decreasing the expression of Bax.

LUNG TUMOR ASSOCIATED DENDRITIC CELL-DERIVED RESISTIN PROMOTED CANCER PROGRESSION BY INCREASING WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME CANDIDATE 1/TWIST PATHWAY
Chih-Hsin Kuo
The Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaoshiung, CHINESE TAIPEI

The interaction between tumors and their microenvironments leads to a vicious cycle which strengthens both immune suppression and cancer progression. The present study demonstrates for the first time that tumor associated dendritic cells (TADCs) can be a source of resistin, which is responsible for increasing lung cancer epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, large amounts of resistin in the condition medium (CM) of TADCs increase cell migration and invasion, as well as the osteolytic bone metastatic properties of A549 cells. Neutralization of resistin from TADC-CM prevents the advanced malignancy-inducing features of TADC-CM. Significantly elevated levels of resistin have been observed tumor-infiltrating CD11c+ DCs in human lung cancer samples, and patients’ sera. Induction of lung cancer progression by TADC-derived resistin is associated with an increased expression of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1), a histone methyltransferase. Resistin-induced WHSC1 increases the dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 36 and decreases the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on the promoter of Twist, resulting in an enhancement of the expression of Twist. Knockdown of WHSC1 by siRNA transfection significantly decreases resistin-mediated cancer progression by decreasing the upregulation of Twist, suggesting that WHSC1 plays a critical role in the regulation of Twist by epigenetic modification. These findings suggest that TADC-derived resistin may be a novel candidate in conferring the ability for lung cancer to develop.

AUTOMATING CANCER DIAGNOSIS: UTILIZING MINKOWSKI-BOULIGAND DIMENSION TO EFFICIENTLY GRADE CELLS
Daniel David White
Somerset Berkley Regional High School, Somerset, MA

The objective of this experiment was to create and test a java-based program capable of more efficiently and accurately assessing the grade of cells thereby automating the process of diagnosing cancer. The cells analyzed were human basal skin cells and the cancer: carcinoma, though the intent is to extend this to a multitude of cell types. The program was designed to work alongside the Philip’s slide scanner with the ability to digitize one slide every 50 seconds.<br><br> Minkowski-Bouligand dimension was utilized to numerically characterize the outer edges of the cells. It was hypothesized that the population mean of grade 1 (normal), grade 2, and grade 3 (cancerous) human basal skin cells each fell within a predictable range of Minkowski-Bouligand dimensions.<br><br> The program utilized a series of image filters to isolate the cells from each of 10 slides. A 10,000-cell sample was randomly selected in which random block design was used to organize the cells into 10-cell partitions eliminating confounding with possible locational nonconformities. Box-counting was used to determine the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension of each cell.<br><br> Statistical significance was achieved through assembly of a 99% confidence interval in which one may be 99% assured that the population mean of grade 1 human basal skin cells will fall within the range of Minkowski-Bouligand dimensions defined by (1.254,1.345), grade 2 by (1.127,1.254) and (1.345,1.672), and grade 3 by (1.000,1.127) and (1.672,2.000). On average the program grades 10,000 cells in 1.775 seconds, an approximate time-efficiency of 48,670 times that of the average pathologist.

DETERMINING THE ANTICOAGULANT EFFECT OF ZINGIBER OFFICINALE
Nicole Taylor Daniell
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown, PA

Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger root, has been used for thousands of years for the treatment of digestive problems, nausea, inflammation and recent studies show it may inhibit the aggregation of platelets. Gingerols and shogoals, the phenolic compounds naturally occurring in ginger, are believed to cause ginger’s anticoagulant effects. The purpose of experimentation is to determine whether or not ginger can be used as an anticoagulant. The hypothesis: Zingiber officinale can serve as a human blood-thinner.<br><br> Five dilutions of ginger root in the form of organic powder and freshly juiced ginger liquid solutions were added to 25 calibrated test tubes. The dilutions were added to fresh blood samples obtained from volunteers. Control clotting sequences were run simultaneously with each experimental dilution. Each sample was timed until fully coagulated. <br><br> In all subjects’ blood samples, the time for clotting increased with higher concentrations of both powder and liquid ginger solutions. The results indicate that Zingiber officinale took longer periods of time for coagulation in human blood samples and, in the future, could be used as a human blood thinner.

PUMPER'S PARADISE: WHICH FAST-ACTING INSULIN ANALOG IS THE MOST EFFICIENT?
James Nathan Hilt
Middleburg High School, Middleburg, FL

The purpose of my experiment was to discover which subtype of fast-acting synthetic insulin analog performs the best at keeping blood sugar levels consistent and stable; Novolog (insulin aspart), or Humalog (insulin lispro), using an insulin pump. The procedures used in this experiment were as follows: use each insulin analog for two week periods, changing insulin pump infusion sets and cartridges every three days, and testing blood glucose levels four to six times per day. I would then record the results with Diasend tracking software, from both the logs kept by my insulin pump and my blood glucose meter. This is how my project’s results were tracked. My experiment ultimately concluded that in fact, insulin aspart, or Novolog, is the most effective insulin analog for keeping blood glucose levels consistent. This conclusion was reached by analyzing Diasend graphs, as well as analyzing the peak activity times of both analogs.

RESISTANCE TO THE MEK INHIBITOR SELUMETINIB (AZD6244) IN UVEAL MELANOMA IS MEDIATED BY THE ACTIVATION OF AKT THROUGH KRAS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT
Natalie Ann Giovino
John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore, NY

Acquired drug resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of all forms of cancer. This study delineates the mechanism of resistance of selumetinib (AZD6244), a MEK inhibitor used to treat uveal melanoma. Uveal melanoma cells with the GNAQ mutation were continually exposed to selumetinib until they maintained steady growth with addition of the drug: modeling acquisition of selumetinib resistance. Selumetinib-resistant cells were more sensitive to AKT inhibitor MK2206 than were selumetinib-sensitive cells. MK2206 was also utilized in combination with selumetinib, and this combination was more effective than either single agent alone. Additionally, KRAS knockdown through siRNA transfection in selumetinib-resistant cells showed that over-activation of KRAS is critical to selumetinib resistance. It was determined that this over-activation mediates activation of AKT, as decreasing KRAS levels resulted in decreased expression of AKT. A clinical trial based on these findings is underway. The results of this study add to the understanding of the mechanisms of acquired selumetinib resistance, though an upstream target resulting in KRAS over-activation is yet to be identified.

LPS/BSA CONTAMINATION: RETHINKING FATTY ACID DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION'S ROLE IN OXIDATIVE STRESS PRODUCTION
Olivia Frances Novick
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Since 2002, companies have supplemented baby formulas with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) based upon the belief that these fatty acids (FAs) beneficially contributed to visual and neurological development in babies. However, recent research reveals positive effects of PUFAs, such as their anti-oxidant properties, may be due to a bacterial lipopolysaccharide(LPS)/BSA reagent contamination instead of the PUFAs themselves. PUFAs' ability to reduce oxidative stress (OS) induced by saturated FAs may no longer hold true. This study examined saturated, monounsaturated, trans fats and PUFAs for OS production at acute and chronic time exposures. OS levels induced by the various FAs were determined by treating RAW264.7 cells with dichlorescein-diacetate and varying concentrations of previously listed FAs against controls of H2O2 and N-Acetyl Cysteine. A PerkinElmer Fluorometer was used to quantify OS expression. All FAs showed pro-oxidative effects, in accordance with previous literature, at both acute and chronic time points. Yet, PUFAs significantly (p=1.153E-26) induced OS, especially in acute exposure, contradicting previous literature. At chronic exposure, PUFAs exhibited OS levels comparable to baseline inducement as cells utilized peroxisomal catalase A as a means to acclimate to increased OS. Year 2 of this study confirmed previous controversial results (gathered in Year 1) that showed previously listed FAs to be pro-oxidative at acute exposures, without LPS/BSA contamination. Further investigations are warranted to determine pro-oxidative effects of PUFAs in relation to supplementation as a means to justify PUFA addition to baby formula, other foods, and/or dietary supplements. PUFAs may be causing more harm than good in infants consuming the supplemented formulas.

CARV-A-CURE: A CELL VIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE APOPTOTIC EFFECTS OF CARVACROL ON PANCREATIC AND COLORECTAL CANCER
Tushar Mittal
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

The purpose of this project is to assess the undiscovered monophenolic effect of Carvacrol on pancreatic and colorectal carcinomas. Carvacrol is found naturally in the oil of the oregano leaf and serves as an effective therapy for many bacterial diseases. In this case study, it is hypothesized that Carvacrol can potentially induce apoptotic effects on pancreatic and colorectal cell lines due to its link to genetic aberrations in cellular proliferation. It is expected to trigger an osmotic shock which will send an intrinsic signal to the cell leading to apoptosis. The experimental procedure is designed for cancerous cell lines derived from mice, in this case PANC-02, CT-26, and splenocytes. Both the cancerous cell lines will be treated with 3 different concentrations of carvacrol (2.7µg/ml, 3.6µg/ml, and 4.5µg/ml) which will serve as the independent variable and one control group will also be assessed with no concentration and the trials performed with splenocytes . This experiment was quite successful with carvacrol having substantial effect on the cell viability of both carcinoma and no impact on the splenocytes, which leads to the support of the hypothesis stated earlier. Due to high availability of carvacrol containing plants such as oregano and its strong apoptotic properties, the compound could serve as the answer to pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma which contributes greatly to the deaths caused by cancer. Its unique properties make it likely to have a similar correlation with various other epidemics associated with genetic aberrations in cell reproduction. Carvacrol also has a higher bioavailability due to the higher molarity capability, which cause its medical benefits to greatly exceed any, current flavonoid-based treatment.

THE USE OF METABOLOMIC PROFILING TO DIAGNOSE OBESITY IN MICE
Jessica Maya
Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

The purpose of my experiment was to perform multiple tests of organic acid levels in different types of obese mice. With this, an average could be calculated for each level that would be accurate enough to show differences between the types of obesity and the control levels of a normal mouse. I would then be able to use the organic acid levels to diagnose the type of obesity in a mouse solely based on the profile that I provide. I worked with three types of mutant mice and a control group. Multiple urine samples were collected from these mice. This included approximately 3 to 5 samples of each type that could be matched by age with each other for better accuracy and less variables. The types included OB/OB, MC3R, and MC4R mutants that would be compared to control (stud) mice. Preparations were done that were needed for the testing of organic acids. This included the measurement of creatinine levels beforehand in order to determine how much of the sample to use in the organic acid testing. I then prepared the samples by extracting the purest or most needed parts of the sample and finally putting a derivatization liquid into it to act as a buffer of the sample in the mass spectrometer. Once it was processed through the gas chromatographer attached to the mass spectrometer, the resulting levels of 33 organic acids, including two internal standards and control levels, were analyzed. I was able to interpret the data and graph the levels of acids to differentiate them between each other. Potentially, after finding the averages of each type, I would be able to find and correctly diagnose other mice with matching metabolomic profiles depicting a type of obesity. This less intrusive and more personal type of medical tool could be used in everyday diagnosis of metabolic diseases.

OVERCOMING APOPTOTIC RESISTANCE TO IAP INHIBITION IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA USING A NOVEL COMBINATION OF A SMAC MIMETIC (LCL161) WITH A PAN-BCL-2 FAMILY INHIBITOR (OBATOCLAX)
Marcus Vincent Gomez
Century High School, Rochester, MN

Chemotherapeutic drug therapy of multiple myeloma (MM), a hematological disorder with 50%+ mortality, focuses on eradicating cancer cells via induction of apoptosis (programmed cell suicide). Inhibition of IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) is required to achieve apoptosis, but MM largely resists apoptosis through IAP inhibition alone. Investigating innovative methods of overcoming apoptotic resistance is critical for advancing MM treatment. Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins are not obstructed by IAP inhibition and could therefore be a target for overcoming apoptotic resistance. The current study addresses this hypothesis by using a novel combination of an IAP inhibitor (LCL161) and a pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor (Obatoclax) in MM; no previous study has evaluated the efficacy of such a combination. MTT and thymidine incorporation assays revealed increased cytotoxicity/decreased proliferation when the drugs were used in combination compared with single agents (80%+ proliferation reduction by the combination); using the Chou-Talalay model, the drugs demonstrated significant synergy—that is, they performed more effectively as a combination than as single agents. Further, the combination completely overcame the protective effects of the tumor microenvironment (bone marrow stromal cells) without detriment to non-malignant cells, an effect not observed with the single agents. Western blots revealed upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bim, Bid, Noxa, Puma, caspases 9,8,3 and PARP and downregulation of anti-apoptotic XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, identifying the mechanisms of apoptosis. These results are the first demonstration that inhibition of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic activity can overcome apoptotic resistance to IAP inhibition and provide a basis for clinical evaluation.

ANALYSIS OF THE ANTAGONISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXTRACT OF CENTELLA ASIATICA, A SOUTH ASIAN HERB ON THE GROWTH OF CANCER CELL LINES: MDA-231 AND MCF-7
Kanithra Chandra Sekaran
Solon High School, Solon, OH

This study is aiming to investigate the anti-cancer activity of Centella asiatica (CA), a south Asian herb and determining its role in breast cancer treatment. Cytotoxic activity on fibroblast cells and the property to induce apoptosis in melanoma and glioblastoma cell lines of CA have qualified it to test its antagonistic activity on the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 and MDA-231 breast cancer cells using MTT assay. Down regulation of the proliferative activity by CA-extracts occurred in a dose-dependent response with a considerable cell death showing relative growth values of 0.394, 0.672, and 0.740 for the 40 µM dosage for MCF-7 cells shows considerable cell death whereas that of MDA-231 cells were: 0.829 and 1.164, indicate Asiatic Acid has no effect on MDA-231 cells. The relative growth of 40 µM dosage was above 0.800, which means that almost no cells are being affected. Since cell death was identified by microscopic inspection confirmed by light scatter characteristics and flow cytometry, our results indicate that CA-extract inhibits the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 but has no effect on the MDA-231 cell line. In conclusion, it is evident that Asiatic Acid has a better effect on MCF-7 than on MDA-231, attributing to the fact that Asiatic Acid is in fact an anti-estrogen with an effect on an estrogen dependent breast cancer cell line. Since the pentacyclic triterpenoid structure of Asiatic Acid is similar to that of estrogen, it would be received in the estrogen receptors in a cancer cell so that cancer cells’ inhibition, making it a viable source for hormonal therapy for breast cancer as Tamoxifen, a drug that achieve the same goal. Further studies need to be done to understand the exact mechanism of CA induced antagonism of MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.

CONTROLLING DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS BY DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION OF TRIGONELLA FOENUM GRACEM (FENUGREEK SEED), A POTENT ANTIDIABETIC HERB
Soiba K. Mansoor
Albuquerque Institute of Math and Science, Albuquerque, NM

Millions of people around the world suffer from diabetes. In this disease, the body does not produce or properly use insulin and is marked by high blood sugars. Diabetes further leads to high blood pressure and cholesterol, which further leads to complications like cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Fenugreek, also known as Trigonella Foenum – Graeucum, has long been used as folk remedy to treat diabetes. It contains several anti diabetic compounds like alkaloid trigonelline which help in controlling the disease. <br><br>This experiment was therefore conducted to see if 500 mg (250 mg/ twice a day) of Fenugreek seed capsules would help in lowering blood sugar, blood pressure and blood cholesterol in NIDDM human subjects.<br><br>This was a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with three groups: Fenugreek supplemented group (n=20), placebo group (n=20) and the control group (n=20). Placebos were made with vegetable capsules filled with rice powder. Blood sugar readings were recorded 3 times a day (fasting, 1 hour, and 2 hour), blood pressure was recorded 2 times a day and blood cholesterol was recorded once a week. After 3 weeks of experimental study, data was collected and analyzed.<br><br>It was concluded that the oral ingestion of Fenugreek showed a hypoglycemic, hypotensive and hypocholesterolemic effect on diabetic subjects and could safely be used in the treatment of type II diabetes. Dietary supplementation of fenugreek can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.

A NOVEL METHODOLOGY TO DEFINE THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AR-MDV3100 ANTAGONISM
Jasper Liangyu Du
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Androgen receptor (AR) is responsible for recurrence in metastatic prostate cancer. Antagonists such as MDV3100 have been synthesized to act as small molecular competitive inhibitors. However, modes of resistance, such as mutations, have developed. To design novel inhibitors of AR and combat resistance-inducing mutations, structural studies such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or x-ray crystallography of an AR-inhibitor complex must be completed. However, when AR binds to an inhibitor, it is insoluble and impure, preventing any structural analysis. Thus, it was proposed to identify a method to solubilize a pure form of the AR-MDV3100 complex. A 2M urea buffer isolated 7 µg/µl of AR at >95% purity, though with no inhibitor attached. However, the structure of AR is unknown and such concentrations allow for structural studies. Fluorescence polarization (FP) can re-bind MDV3100 while confirming proper folding of AR. The AR-MDV3100 complex was also observed to have sufficient concentrations, though degraded. Repeating purification may yield higher concentrations, undegraded. A computational model via FlexX indicated a possible interaction between the dimethyl group of MDV3100 and the F764 amino acid residue of AR. These protocols allow for the discovery of the structure of AR-MDV3100 to confirm or modify the model proposed by FlexX.

INVESTIGATING THE TUBULIN-MEDIATED ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE AND CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF 6-SHOGAOL EXTRACTED FROM GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE) RHIZOMES TO DETERMINE ITS POTENTIAL AS AN ANTI-CANCER AGENT
Darren Yong Sheng Wong
Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Singapore, SINGAPORE

This study investigated the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of 6-shogaol [(E)-1-(4-Hydroxy-3- methoxyphenyl)dec-4-en-3-one] derived from ginger rhizomes, in order to verify its viability as an anti-cancer agent. Crude Ginger Extract (CGE) was obtained from ginger rhizomes via water-solvent-based reflux. 6-shogaol content was then estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteau Assay. CGE’s anti-proliferative capacity was determined by quantifying the change mass of Zea mays calluses, the rate of Allium cepa root elongation and the mitotic-index of Allium cepa root tip cells, exposed to varying concentrations [0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 mg/L Gallic Acid Equivalent] of CGE. Z. mays callus cells and A. cepa root apical meristematic cells were used as proximate models of rapid cellular proliferation. Subsequently, the cytotoxicity of CGE was quantified by the Tryphan Blue Cell Viability assay, using log-phase cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A significant negative correlation was observed between CGE concentration and the change in mass of Z. mays calluses (p<0.05), the rate of root elongation (p<0.01), and the mitotic index of A. cepa root apical meristematic cells (p<0.001), suggesting that CGE exhibits anti-proliferative activity in a concentration-dependent manner. No significant change (p=0.748) was observed between S. cerevisiae cell viability and CGE concentration for concentrations up to 120mg/L GAE of CGE, suggesting that CGE exhibits an anti-proliferative effect independent of cellular cytotoxicity. In conclusion, CGE could potentially exhibit significant anti-cancer activity whilst sparing normal somatic cells. However, further research using mammalian cell models would be needed to validate CGE’s viability as an economical and effective anti-cancer agent.

A NOVEL CANCER-TAILORED TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM
Jay Harshad Mehta
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

Nanoparticle (NP) targeted drug delivery systems (TDDS) provide protection and enhanced uptake of therapeutic agents. Existing TDDS technology consists of pre-manufactured NPs with fixed targeting ligands. Therefore, if a patient does not exhibit proper characteristics recognized by a targeting ligand that particular NP will be ineffective in treating the patient.<br><br> This project developed a novel idea of in-clinic coating of existing NPs with a desired ligand. The novelty is a patient-tailored, TDDS that is self-forming in the clinic. The patient can have their cells characterized for targeting receptors followed by the formulation mixing with the most appropriate, matching targeting ligand. <br><br> Poly( lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs were fabricated, collected, and suspended into deionized water. To readily coat NPs with targeting ligand, Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)–poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) linker, at different concentrations, was added using a syringe pump. Characterization of NPs and NPs with PLGA-PEG was performed with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and other methodologies. DLS showed a direct relationship to the size of the particles with the amount of PLGA-PEG added.<br><br> The size of PLGA NPs was 676.4 nm. Adding 1.5 mL of .75 mg/mL concentration of PLGA-PEG to the NPs, the size was 907.9 nm. Conclusively, the PLGA-PEG successfully coated PLGA. <br><br> The mixing can be readily done in-clinic to allow attachment of a targeting ligand and has great potential for multiple cancer sub-types, and numerous applications of personalized medicine, where TDDS would be advantageous.

BIOMARKERS OF VASODILATION IN DECIDUAL TISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES
Sophie Rose Shoemaker
Camas High School, Camas, WA

The placenta is a very important part of pregnancy. It acts as the barrier between mother and child through which every substance necessary for life and development must pass. In order to support the fetus, nutrients and other substances must pass through the maternal portion of the placenta known as the decidua. The decidua contains many veins and arteries to transport blood through the placenta. Any change in this blood flow can cause many problems in the pregnancy. The current obesity epidemic is increasing the occurrence of complications in pregnancies which are related to a high fat diet (HFD). Previous studies show that a high fat diet in pregnancy is related to a decrease in the uteroplacental blood flow. This decrease may be the cause of complications such as stillbirth. Several enzymes and hormones control blood flow in the placenta. One of these is endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). eNOS is a commonly used marker for vasodilation as it produces nitric oxide which has a vasodilatory effect on placental blood vessels. Another is Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a hormone that constricts blood vessels and increases platelet aggregation. The TXA2 receptor (TXA2-R) is a protein which is used to assess the amount of active TXA2 in the tissue. In this experiment, decidua from control and high fat diet fed Japanese macaques was tested for eNOS and TXA2-R. In the end it was found that eNOS was significantly less abundant in high fat diet fed tissue than control tissue while TXA2-R was not significantly different.

A NOVEL QUANTIFICATION OF FAT AND FIBROSIS IN CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE BY COMPUTER ASSISTED MORPHOMETRY
Zacharia Hosseinipour
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

The obesity epidemic occurring worldwide has led to an increase in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), two of the most prevalent and deadly hepatic disorders. NAFLD and NASH are the result of the accumulation of fat and fibrosis, respectively, in the liver, which impedes function of the vital organ. Diagnosis of the disease is subjective and involves invasive, costly procedures. The hypothesis was that computer morphometry could be used to quantify fat and collagen in the liver and uncover biomarkers to evade invasive liver biopsies and create a more accurate diagnosis. Slides were scanned and fat and collagen were quantified using digital imaging software and a custom algorithm. Values were compared to blood serum levels of different antigens and metabolic factors in the same patient. M65 and M30, antigens that are indicators of cellular apoptosis, were ruled as statistically significant biomarkers, and other factors did not seem to have any relationship with fat and collagen, such as age, gender, and even commonly perceived risk factors such as serum triglyceride levels and body mass index. These findings hold great promise to bypass health complications of liver biopsies, alter our conception of a direct relationship between risk factors and disease, and create a more accurate, cost-effective diagnosis through the novel method of computer morphometry in NAFLD and NASH.

A NOVEL MICRORNA-BASED SYSTEM FOR CANCER MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
Jason Shao Cui
Langley High School, McLean, VA

With research efforts directed toward cancer diagnosis and treatment, there lacks a reliable and accurate method of cancer management and monitoring. Solid tumors may be analyzed through CT/PET/MRI scan analyses; however, these methods are expensive, imprecise, prone to human error. Serum tumor markers that utilize proteins, although a bit more versatile in gauging disease activity, are unreliable in that they show major fluctuations in levels and are not present in all forms of cancer. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNAs of 20-24 nucleotides in length that target the 3’ UTRs of mRNAs, pose as more viable biomarkers as they play important roles in virtually all biological pathways and are dysregulated as a part of disease progression. Additionally, they are stable and reproducible in human serum. <br><br>This study tested the hypothesis that a novel, microRNA-based cancer management system could be synthesized to both consistently and accurately map out disease progression. Targeting Multiple Myeloma (MM), a reliable model was synthesized through dose-response tests and global miRNA expression was quantified with high-sensitivity microarrays and linked to respective mRNA and gene expression with Ingenuity systems. Furthermore, custom quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to simulate disease progression and gauge miRNA fluctuations. Statistical analyses isolated and proved miRNA fluctuation patterns; more importantly, microarray and qRT-PCR tests showed the ability to isolate and track specific miRNAs in disease progression. This study was the first to not only measure miRNA fluctuation patterns, but also to analyze patterns and synthesize correlations to gene activity - revealing and developing miRNA’s massive potential in disease management.

World Health Organization reports that 80% of the world’s population depends on medicine for their primary health care needs. Since the beginning of civilization man used plants as medicines. The methodology by which the ancient man acquired an insight into the knowledge of selective uses of various plants is still debated. He acquired, by trial and error, the knowledge of determining which plants could be used as food and which were to be avoided because they were unpalatable or poisonous. The healing properties of certain herbs or different parts of a plant were discovered by ancient.<br><br>Euphorbia helioscopia L. (Family Euphorbiaceae) is widely used as a medicinal plant in the area of District Haripur, Khyber Phaktunkhuwa, Pakistan. This plant is very effective in the treatment of ring worm, eczema, abscesscs, scabies, psoriasis and other skin diseases. The present project is the part of the reports that the local plants are used as medicinal plants by the local people and local practitioners. The ointment of Euphorbia helioscopia prepared in mustered oil was used as the remedy of scabies and psoriasis. Excellent results were obtained after fifteen days use of oil of Euphorbia helioscopia. No side effects were observed during the study. The authenticity of the oil was confirmed with the collaborative studies of the hospitals also.<br><br>A large number of phytochemicals and flavonoids (22 compounds reported) were isolated from Euphorbia helioscopia. These phytochemicals may be responsible for this activity so further studies are required for the isolation of active compound.

ISOLATING THE HUNTINGTIN PROTEIN
Emma Fine
DaVinci Academy, South Ogden, UT

The Huntingtin (Htt) protein can be found in a number of different species and areas, but the highest concentration is in the brain, cerebral fluid, and spinal cord. Huntington’s disease is caused by the trinucleotide repeat expansion CAG. In a normal brain, CAG is only repeated around 35 times while a brain with Huntington’s disease can have up to 180 repeats. These repeats of the triplets (CAG) and the glutamines (Q) cause the protein to glom on top of itself and deteriorate the neurons. The protein, which is found in a gene on the 4th chromosome, is what we were trying to find. I was able to test three different species for the Huntingtin protein: a Danio (zebra fish) RNA, mouse RNA, and human DNA. To isolate the protein, I used a number of different procedures including PCR, (Reverse transcriptase) RT, gel electrophoresis, using a microcentrifuge, and gel extraction. The RT-PCR was used to convert the RNA into DNA in the mouse and the Danio. After running a gel on the PCR product and finding the protein in the Danio, I used the gel extraction method and the microcentrifuge to increase concentration of the Huntington protein I was able to isolate. Scientists in this field rarely use this process because they can immediately have the purified form of the protein by raising mice and zebra fish with the disease, or collecting brain samples from a human autopsy. These might be quicker methods but they can be unethical and quite expensive.

CAN POMEGRANATE PREVENT HUMAN PANCREATIC AND COLON ADENOCARCINOMA?
Deena S. Mousa
Emma Willard School, Troy, NY

Purpose: To determine the potential effect of pomegranate extract (PE) and its bioactive compounds on human pancreatic and colon adenocarcinoma (PAC and CAC) . Background: PAC, which is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, carries the highest fatality rate among all human cancers. Similarly, the incidence of CAC, which shares an epithelial origin with PAC, is on the rise. PE and its ellagic acid, resveratrol and punicalagin, polyphenols abundant in PE show suppression of prostate cancer in clinical and experimental studies. Hypothesis: PE and its polyphenols will inhibit human PAC and CAC progression. Experimental Plans: Use human PAC and CAC cells to examine effects of PE versus its main bioactive polyphenols on the followings: Growth factors secreted from either PAC or CAC cells such as fibroblast or vascular endothelial growth factor (FGF2 or VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis in the Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) model and PAC or CAC tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis in the CAM tumor implant model, n = 8 per group. Statistical Analysis: Student t- test was used for paired comparison between the control and the different treatment groups and one way ANOVA for comparison among the different groups. Results: PE and its individual ingredients demonstrated a direct inhibitory effect (P < 0.01) on angiogenesis- mediated by growth factors secreted from cancer cells, such as FGF2 and VEGF. PE and its individual ingredients significantly suppressed PAC and CAC growth (P < 0.01) and tumor angiogenesis (P < 0.01). These findings documented that PE and its derived bioactive compounds suppress human PAC and CAC. Conclusion: Tumor growth suppression by PE and its bioactive compounds might be due the effective inhibition of tumor blood supply, resulting in tumor starvation.

ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOTOR-SENSORY CIRCUIT IN A ZEBRAFISH MODEL OF SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Duy Quoc Phan
Upper Arlington High School, Columbus, OH

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), caused by insufficient levels of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy due to motorneuron loss. Type I patients and various mouse models exhibit motor and sensory defects, suggesting that components of the motor-sensory circuit develop abnormally. SMA has the potential to be treated by increasing SMN levels, but it is unclear where SMN is needed. Understanding whether motor-sensory defects are motorneuron autonomous is crucial for identifying where SMN is required. The zebrafish emerges as a strong model for studying the development of the motor-sensory circuit, because its optically clear embryos allows for in vivo and comprehensive analysis of neuron development at the single cell level. To model SMA, zebrafish with low levels of SMN have been generated (Maternal Zygotic, MZ). Single cell analysis of motorneurons in MZ zebrafish revealed abnormal development of motor axon and dendrites. In addition, Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in MZ fish exhibited abnormal development of peripheral axon and cell death. To investigate the efficacy of targeting motor neurons, MZ zebrafish with motorneuron-specific expression of SMN was generated. Having SMN in motorneurons was able to correct motorneuron development. Strikingly, motorneuron-specific expression of SMN was sufficient to rescue abnormal DRG neuron development. These data indicate that deficits of the motor-sensory circuit arise directly from defective motorneurons. Thus, the motorneuron is an important therapeutic target for maintaining the motor-sensory circuit, which may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

LIFEGUARD INHIBITION OF FAS-MEDIATED APOPTOSIS AS A MECHANISM OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC RESISTANCE
Daniel Pierce Radin
Academy for Medical Science and Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Triple-negative breast cancer is unresponsive to hormone or antibody therapy. Cisplatin has been shown to induce p73-dependent apoptosis through Fas-mediated Caspase-8 activation. The triple-negative breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 (MDA), overexpresses the protein Lifeguard, which inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis potentially conferring resistance. This research investigates the relationship between Fas, Lifeguard and cisplatin by down regulating Lifeguard (shRNA). Results (24h) demonstrated cisplatin’s efficacy increased when Lifeguard was down regulated (ANCOVA, p<1E-4). Lifeguard knockdown MDA viability decreased at 48 hours following cisplatin treatment (ANCOVA, p<0.0001). Wild-Type MDA showed no further decrease (ANCOVA, p=0.15). Cisplatin increased Fas ligand production in both cell lines in a dose-response fashion (ANOVA, p<0.005). Lifeguard Knockdown MDA were more susceptible to exogenous FasL induced apoptosis (ANCOVA, p<0.006). Higher Caspase-8 activity in Lifeguard Knockdown MDA (ANCOVA, p<0.002) suggested cisplatin induced FasL production may be the cause of the added cell death at 48 hours. The Fas-mediated bystander effect was investigated by co-culturing Wild-Type and Lifeguard Knockdown MDA with non-transfected MDA pre-exposed to cisplatin. The decline in Lifeguard Knockdown MDA viability in co-culture may be due to cisplatin’s upregulation of FasL (ANCOVA, p<1.2E-8). Current work investigates functionally mimicking LFG downregulation by inhibiting PI3K activity via BEZ235. It has been shown that PI3K inhibition reduces Lifeguard mRNA transcription. Results demonstrate BEZ235 sensitizes Wild-Type MDA to cisplatin (ANCOVA, P<0.005) and modulates LFG. This research suggests that chemotherapy acting through Fas would be more effective in the absence of Lifeguard.

A NOVEL APPROACH FOR CANCER PREVENTION: THE USE OF LYCOPENE TO STIMULATE APOPTOSIS IN UV-DAMAGED SF9 CELLS
Christon Alexis Petersen
Shawnee Mission West High School, Overland Park, KS

In 2012 there were an estimated 1,638,910 new cases of cancer, not including non-melanoma skin cancers, which caused 577,190 deaths in the United States. Cancer is a major cause of mortality in not only North America but the world. In addition to family history, diet and lifestyle are considered important factors in this disease. Cancer cells are immortal. That is, the cells “ignore” the chemical signals during the cell cycle. This causes the cells to grow without control resulting in too many cells that then create a mass – a tumor. Normal cells have a limited life span, followed by cell suicide, apoptosis. Therefore, the number of cells is controlled. Evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of cancer and other chronic diseases. Oxidative stress is the disturbances in a normal cell’s state that can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals which damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Recently, studies indicated that adding lycopene to your diet aids in the destruction of cancer cells. More specifically, evidence indicates a daily lycopene intake of 30mg was considered adequate to combat oxidative stress. In order to test whether or not lycopene would have any effect on cancer cells, a lycopene solution (LyD) was placed in Sf9 cells that were exposed and damaged by ultraviolet rays. Apoptosis increased significantly in cells exposed to UV and cultured with lycopene. Lycopene has a promising future in its ability to initiate apoptosis.

BERBERINE: A POTENTIAL NATURAL DRUG TO COMBAT OXIDATIVE STRESS
Sarthak Garg
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases and vascular dysfunction. Augmenting the intake of any antioxidant modifier to enhance the endogenous defense capacity against oxidative stress could prevent oxidative damage. Berberine (Ber), an effective alkaloid component of Chinese herbal medicine Rhizoma coptidis extract, exhibits antioxidative properties and ameliorates endothelial functions in humans. The present study investigated the protective effects of Ber on H2O2-induced endothelial cell toxicity. Results demonstrated that Ber increases EA.hy926 cells viability from H2O2-induced toxicity, and prevents mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which is an early marker of cell death (apoptosis). Ber, in addition to rescuing endothelial cells from DNA double strand breaks as a result of H2O2-induced oxidative stress, also showed reduction in peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production. It also prevented the morphological alteration induced by H2O2 to a greater extent. The protective effects of Ber on H2O2-induced endothelial cell toxicity were achieved via the antioxidative effects of Ber.

WHICH SUBSTANCE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI: AN ANTIBIOTIC MAGAZINE OR AN ORGANIC COMPOUND?
Rebecca Hope Caughman
Batesburg-Leesville High School, Batesburg-Leesville, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to see which testing agent worked best in preventing the growth of Escherichia coli. This experiment compared organic remedies to antibiotic magazines, allowing the tester to determine which substance would work the best if used to treat an infection. The hypothesis of this experiment stated that of the antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin would inhibit the growth the most, and of the organics, tart cherry juice would inhibit the growth the most. Overall, the antibiotics were believed to work the best with Ciprofloxacin being the best of all of the testing agents. <br><br> The substances used to perform this experiment were water (for the control), Ciprofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim, tart cherry juice concentrate, and cranberry juice cocktail. The two antibiotics were ordered on discs that had already been infused with the agents. For the water and the juices, blank sterile discs were soaked in each substance for ten seconds. The tester then placed the infused discs on Petri dishes that contained one milliliter of E. coli. The dishes were inverted, placed in an incubator and allowed to grow for forty-eight hours.<br><br> In conducting this experiment, it was found that the hypothesis was supported with the antibiotics working the best. The averages showed that the Ciprofloxacin and Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim worked better than the organic compounds with Ciprofloxacin working the best. Of the organic compounds, the tart cherry juice concentrate worked better than the cranberry juice cocktail. <br><br>

Navajo Preparatory School, Farmington, NM

The purpose of the research is to determine which caffeinated beverage will significantly increase the heart rate of the Daphnia magna. I used Daphnia magna to test, because the Daphnia magna heart is similar to a human heart by of the way it pulses. I hypothesize that energy drink with coffee will significantly increase the heart rate of a Daphnia magna.<br><br>Twelve types of caffeinated beverages were used in the study and distilled water was used as the control. I put the Daphnia magna on a microscope slide and observed the Daphnia magna at 40x magnification. Before inducing, I counted the heart rate. Then, I induced the Daphnia magna with 1 mL of caffeinated beverage and counted the heart rate for ten trials.<br><br>The results turned out that the energy drink with coffee had significantly increased the heart rate of the Daphnia magna by 91.29 beats per minute. My hypothesis was correct; energy drink with coffee had significantly increased the heart rate. From observing, I have learned that caffeine has caused the Daphnia magna to shuffle around more than normal which can be linked of hyper activity. After doing my research, I have learned that there is a limitation of the ingestion of caffeine for Daphnia magna and for humans. Overall, I learned that caffeine can be addictive and if a person drinks too much, it can be dangerous.

EXAMINATION OF QUORUM SENSING MECHANISMS IN GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME

Background<br><br>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a prevalent and deadly primary brain tumor in humans. It is reported that glycoprotein Prominin 1 (CD133/1) expression is associated with a distinct population of stem/progenitor GBM cells that have increased capacities for self-renewal, sphere formation, and tumor initiation.<br><br>Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-signaling mechanism utilized by bacteria to track cell density and coordinate gene expression and population behavior based on said cell density. I hypothesized that a QS mechanism may be used by GBM cells to regulate populations of CD133-expressing cells.<br><br>Phase I<br><br>Patient-derived brain tumor cells (cell line PBT003) were cultured in vitro for several passages, following which fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to separate CD133/1^POS cells from CD133/1^NEG cells. Cells of the top 5% of each group (selected to ensure purity) were cultured separately for twelve days. Cells were then reanalyzed for CD133/1 expression using flow cytometry.<br><br>CD133/1^POS and CD133/1^NEG PBT003 cell populations responded differently to culture: the CD133/1^NEG population originally isolated by FACS remained almost entirely CD133/1^NEG, whereas the CD133/1^POS population returned to a “steady state” in which the ratio of CD133/1^POS to CD133/1^NEG cells mirrored that of the original unsorted cultures.<br><br>Phase II<br><br>PBT003 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of exogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) for six days, following which their CD133/1 expression was assayed by flow cytometry. Preliminary results indicate that TNF-a increases CD133 expression (as compared to cultures without TNF-a). This observation suggests that TNF-a secreted by tumor cells could act as an autoinducer in a QS model of CD133 expression.

DETERMINING THE BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF PENTEDRONE-BASED “BATH SALTS” ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Alaina Nicole Sonksen
Camdenton High School, Camdenton, MO

In the United States and all around the world, drug use is a current and rising problem. One drug in particular has been increasing in popularity within the last decade – “bath salts”. Many of its short term effects have been observed, but long term effects have yet to be explored and discovered.<br><br> The purpose of my project is to experiment and investigate the effects of one popular drug that is abused by many individuals in today’s society. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were exposed to levels of both pentedrone and Pump-It Powder brand bath salts that replicated a typical human dosage. The control group subjects had no substance administered. All three groups (control, pentedrone, and Pump-It Powder) were remotely photographed at even intervals using an automated camera in a self-designated chamber which allowed for all subjects to be observed but isolated from the other two groups. I observed three different aspects of the fruit flies’ behavior and physiology – mortality, feeding, behavior, and activity levels. Using the photographs, quantitative data was measured and collected.<br><br> Results of this study indicate that mortality rates were significantly greater with exposure to both pentedrone and Pump-it Powder. Results also demonstrated that fruit flies exposed to both pentedrone and Pump-it Powder were significantly less likely to feed, even several hours after exposure. Furthermore, activity levels of flies exposed to both substances were significantly reduced for the duration of the study.

TARGETING INTERACTIONS IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AS A NOVEL TREATMENT FOR METASTATIC LUNG CANCER
Brianna Pereira
Academy for Medical Science Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Lung cancer often metastasizes by the time of diagnosis, rendering conventional treatments ineffective. Tumor cell interactions with the microenvironment at metastatic sites such as bone marrow support development of resistance to therapy. Chemokines produced by noncancerous cells play a role in such interactions by activating tumor cell receptors, contributing to cancer progression and treatment failure. Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1a) produced by marrow stromal cells induces migration, gene transcription, and proliferation by activating its receptor CXCR4 found aberrantly on tumor cells. This project investigated an off-label use of CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 as a treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (A549) by disrupting cell signaling in the microenvironment. It was found that AMD3100 treatment (1.25-320ug/mL) significantly inhibited SDF-1a induced A549 adhesion to marrow stromal cells (M2-10B4) (p<0.05) and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1) (p<0.05) most likely by reducing CXCR4-mediated activation of integrin VLA-4 in A549 (p<0.05). Migration assays showed SDF-1a induced CXCR4-mediated A549 migration was interrupted by AMD3100 (p<0.01). Disrupting interactions in the microenvironment may serve to mobilize cells into circulation, increasing their exposure to treatment. ELISA showed AMD3100 reduced Rho and MMP-9 (p<0.05) in A549 suggesting reduction in processes necessary for invasiveness. AMD3100 reduced VEGF, important in development of tumor vasculature (p<0.05). P13K and NFkB expression involved in SDF-1a proliferative effects were modulated showing AMD3100 may be efficacious through the P13K-Akt-NFkB axis. Results suggest AMD3100 is a potential novel treatment of metastatic NSCLC by targeting the tumor microenvironment.

ADVANCING PRECISION MEDICINE: MICRORNA PROGNOSTIC SIGNATURES AND PREDICTION MODELS FOR DISTANT METASTASIS-FREE SURVIVAL IN BREAST CANCER
Natalie Ng
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

My research aims to develop miRNA prognostic signatures as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer. This project has three phases: (1) in-silico discovery of miRNA prognostic signatures predictive of distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer, (2) experimental validation of the prognostic signatures in vitro, and (3) a further investigation of the effects of miRNA expression modulation on metastatic potential. In Phase 1, I proposed and developed a novel computational method, which consists of integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expressions with the aid of a knowledge-based tool and survival modeling, to identify miRNA prognostic signatures predictive of metastasis. The accuracies of the prediction models were cross-validated using independent patient samples. Phase 2 assessed the correlation between miRNA expressions (qPCR) and metastatic potential. Metastatic potential was characterized using cell migration and invasion (Transwell assay) and proliferation (MTT assay). Correlation between detectable miRNA expressions and metastatic potential was confirmed for the highly metastatic cell line, according to model prediction. In Phase 3, miRNA modulation experiments support that miR-210 and miR-133a are independent indicators of metastatic potential. Major accomplishments of my research are (1) the development of parsimonious, accurate prognostic signatures that have been validated both computationally and experimentally, (2) the identification of 17 known and 9 new miRNAs involved in breast cancer metastasis, and (3) the identification of miR-210 and miR-133a as independent indicators of metastasis. My research advances precision medicine using miRNA technology and has applications as a diagnostic tool to allow doctors to prescribe personalized treatment strategies.

A NOVEL MULTI-DIMENSIONAL GENOMIC DATA ANALYSIS OF HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA AND ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES
Swetha Revanur
Evergreen Valley High School, San Jose, CA

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a poorly understood chronic skin disease marked by painful cysts. Despite a prevalence of about 1%, no potent treatment or cure exists. A novel multi-dimensional genomic data analysis of HS and its comorbidities (Crohn’s Disease, Down Syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Hypothyroidism) was performed. The genomic dimensions considered were gene, pathway, and microRNA profiles.<br><br> Data sources for every dimension were identified; the relevant genomic datasets were acquired and cleansed. Using Microsoft Excel functions, curated datasets for each disease and dimension were analyzed. A quantitative model was defined to compute a correlation index for each dimension and for all dimensions combined. <br><br> Analysis shows that HS has a strong correlation with SCC and RA, a moderate correlation with Crohn’s, and a relatively weak link with Down Syndrome and Hypothyroidism. Genes IL6, IL10, and TNF play an active role in all comorbidities. MicroRNAs hsa-miR-214, hsa-miR-31, and hsa-miR-7 were identified to directly target HS marker genes. Verification in a clinical setting could qualify these microRNAs as biomarkers for HS. Alzheimer’s Disease was found to have a genomic correlation with HS. This study also provides a rationale for why HS is seen more in women using key links with estrogen regulation via GPCR and Alzheimer’s Disease pathways. This novel method reveals many new details about HS that can be utilized for further analyses or to develop potent medications for HS. This model, including computation of correlation index, can be employed to investigate other diseases and their comorbidities.

THE ROLE OF P-GLYCOPROTEIN IN CANCER CELL MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE: A MECHANISTIC APPROACH
Lavanya Rajendra Garnepudi
Centennial High School, Ellicott City, MD

Multidrug resistance is a common phenomenon which occurs in cancer patients. This phenomenon has been attributed to the over expression of a membrane protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cancer cells. P-gp effluxes chemotherapeutic drugs thus reducing their effectiveness in cancer treatment. The goal of this study was two fold. One aspect studied the effectiveness of natural compound derivatives in inhibiting P-glycoprotein function. The other aspect studied the structure-function relationship of P-gp protein in order to understand its mechanism of action. Many P-gp inhibitors that are now being tested in clinical trials, have been found to be effective inhibitors of P-gp function, but have also been found to cause side effects in patients. It was predicted that flavonoids and their derivatives may have the potential to inhibit P-gp function with reduced side effects. Coumarin, a common flavonoid, and its two derivatives were studied to be potential inhibitors of P-gp. These novel compounds were compared with a known inhibitor of P-gp, Tariquidar which is currently under study in clinical trials. Fluorescence assays showed that the Monomeric derivative of Coumarin, 1d57HN(4-BenzoylBn), was found to be very effective in inhibiting P-gp function. Mutagenesis studies that were designed to understand the structure-function relationship pointed to the importance of lysine residues located in the extracellular domain of P-gp for protein translocation and function. This study aimed to unravel the potential of alternative medicine in treating one of the deadliest diseases that kill millions of individuals each year.

REGULATORY MOTIFS THAT CONTROL THE TRAFFICKING AND ASSEMBLY OF GAP JUNCTIONS FORMED OF CONNEXIN32
Nimansha Jain
Millard North High School, Omaha, NE

Gap junctions are conglomerations of cell-cell channels and signal by permitting the exchange of small molecules between contiguous cells. Evidence is mounting that this form of signaling fulfills a homeostatic role. Gap junctions are formed of proteins called connexins, which are transmembrane proteins that span the membrane four times and are expressed redundantly. The molecular mechanisms that regulate their assembly and disassembly are poorly understood. The assembly of connexin32, which is expressed by the normal prostate epithelial cells, is disrupted in prostate tumors. I have explored the molecular mechanisms which regulate the assembly of connexin32 into gap junctions in a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which is connexin-null but assembles exogenously introduced connexins. The results showed that the connexin32 cytoplasmic tail harbors three dileucine-like motifs which control its trafficking and assembly into gap junctions in LNCaP cells. The results further showed that compared to wild-type connexin32, mutants L251A/L252A and L263A/I264, in which the dileucine-like motifs had been mutated, formed larger gap junctions, whereas mutant L212A/I213A failed to assemble into gap junctions due to impaired trafficking. These results will enhance our understanding about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the assembly and disassembly of connexin32 during prostate morphogenesis and oncogenesis.

THE BRINK OF LIFE AND DEATH: SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT VARIABLES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON MORTALITY
Jingwei (Jason) Tu
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

The goal of this project was to analyze Intensive Care Unit data and derive statistically significant results that would aid emergency medical technicians in better understanding the needs of their patients. Data for 4000 ICU cases (each containing 40 variables) was obtained through the 2012 Physionet Challenge, and was stratified by gender. Work was divided between four stages. Stage One revolved around defining the implications and effects of each variable involved in the data set, as well as relationship between the General Descriptors (variables measured only once, such as age) and the outcome sets, in order to contextualize variables, and fully comprehend their impact on a person’s health. Stage Two involved defining the distribution of values of the Time Series Variables(variables measured periodically, such as heart rate) and determining the shape and spread of these distributions. Stage Three involved running logistic regressions on all variables using R statistical analysis software, and determining the significance of these variables against mortality. The variables FiO2 (fractional oxygen), Hematocrit, Potassium, and Sodium levels were found to be insignificant in causing death for either men or women, while the other variables were significant for at least one gender. Stage Four involved deriving two algorithms (one for each gender) using logistic regressions and developing software that would make these algorithms accessible to doctors. This software was also developed to alert doctors to variables that were above or below their healthy reference ranges, as well as provide a list of potential causes of abnormalities in the variable.

IDENTIFYING BIOMARKERS THAT PREDICT THE ONSET OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS
Alexis Joy Harroun
Bellarmine Prepatory School, Tacoma, WA

The study of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is important for reducing risk of harm to pregnant mothers and their children. The objective of this study was to identify proteomic biomarkers that predict the development of GDM. Six women who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM were used as cases and seven normotensive patients were used as controls. Proteomic analysis of all three trimesters performed by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry produced two proteins of interest. Apolipoproteins A-II and C-III (Apo A-II and C-III) were identified as potential GDM biomarkers as both were significantly down-regulated in the third trimester compared to the first trimester for GDM patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) confirmed that Apo A-II was down-regulated over the course of the pregnancy compared to controls, although Apo C-III trends failed to reach statistical significance. Cholesterol quantification was used to quantify concentrations of HDL cholesterol, associated with Apo A-II, and VLDL/LDL cholesterol, associated with Apo C-III, which were down-regulated in GDM patients, although only VLDL/LDL was statistically significant. This study suggests that apolipoproteins A-II and C-III may be viable biomarkers for detecting GDM in pregnant women.

COLD COMFORT: NO PAIN NO GAIN
Robert Allen Morgette
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

This Experiment studied the effects of ice slurry ingestion during high intensity, short duration exercise on former sedentary women (Ages 30-50). Cortisol levels in sedentary or non active individuals tend to increase drastically during exercise and continue to rise after exercise. This experiment measured the effects of ice slurry ingestion as a post exercise drink to help recovery time and lower cortisol levels. Participants performed four trials each consisting of a 10 minute workout session that included cardio and strength training with no rest between stations. The amount of repetitions of the entire circuit achieved at the end of each trial was recorded at the end of each trial. Perceived exertion was taken to examine the perception of workouts by participants. Salivary samples were taken before, after, and 30 min. after workouts to analyze stress levels in the body.<br><br> Exercise performance increased significantly in all trials. It is unclear whether the increased performance was caused by ice slushy ingestion before exercise. Combining ice slushy ingestion pre and post exercise showed to have a significant effect on recovery of cortisol levels. Further research needs to be performed to clarify whether the increase was caused by the cooling effect of ice slushy ingestion or training effect.

MUC16/CA125 AND GALECTIN-3 RELATIONSHIP IN OVARIAN CANCER
Sahityasri Thapi
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

CA125 is the marker for ovarian cancer cells and is labeled MUC16 in reference to its mucinous character. MUC16 is heavily N- and O- glycosylated. Galectins are sugar-binding proteins that have been observed at elevated levels in cancer patients. Galectins provide MUC16 with nutrients for glycosylation at its N- and O-glycosylation sites. It was hypothesized that blocking galectin-3’s (GAL3) binding with MUC16 would decrease aggressive invasive properties of tumor cells and normalize up-regulated Akt, Erk, Src, and EGFR downstream cell signals. The sugar-binding portion of GAL3 was fused with plasmid vector pFUSE-human IgG1-Fc2 to form a fusion protein. This protein was cultured with SKOV3 and A2780 MUC16 bearing cell lines. A highly significant (p<0.001) decrease of matrigel invaded cells was observed. The fusion protein was also cultured with SKOV3 and 3T3 MUC16 bearing cells and a western blot analysis of phospho-Akt, phosho-Erk, phosphor-Src, and phospho-EGFR signals was conducted. It was found that these signals were diminished in MUC16 positive cell lines that were cultured with the fusion protein, indicating that these signals are dependent on GAL3. Since Akt, Erk, Src, and EGFR signals all contribute to tumor growth and progression, their down regulation causes the tumor’s invasive properties to diminish. This provides a possible explanation for the results of the first aspect of this study. The results of this study contribute to the field of ovarian cancer research by establishing a novel relationship between MUC16 and GAL3. Further experimentation in animals would validate the results.

BREAST CANCER PROGNOSIS THROUGH GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING AND TUMOR MORPHOLOGY
Andrew Cheng Jin
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

In a world where 20% of breast cancer survivors suffer recurrence, accurate tumor prognosis and recurrence prediction are becoming increasingly crucial in ensuring that patients receive proper attention and treatment; a tumor correctly identified as aggressive can be given a more potent form of treatment to ensure that recurrence does not occur.<br><br>The purpose of this project was twofold. First, to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) prognostic model that accurately predicts whether a breast cancer patient is likely to experience a recurrence after treatment. Second, to identify highly predictive features in the model, which allows for the discovery of characteristics that play integral roles in tumor proliferation and recurrence; this aids in the discovery of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.<br><br>Three types of features were explored when creating the SVM model: gene expression of individual genes, gene expression analyzed holistically over gene sets, and morphologic features from tumor slide images; a total of 3955 potentially informative features were identified. This study was unique in its emphasis on gene sets and integration of gene expression and morphology.<br><br>After going through supervised learning on the training set, the integrative SVM model incorporating all three feature types (gene expression, gene set, and image features) yielded an accuracy rate of 86.7% when predicting recurrence outcome for the validation set. <br><br>Within the optimal subset of 132 features used in the model, features such as the Symporter Activity Gene Set, Actin Filament Binding Gene Set, and UBR2 gene exhibit significant causal relations to breast cancer recurrence. These newly implicated features can be biologically explored to better understand the mechanisms of cancer.

DESIGNING A NOVEL FREEZE-STABLE TETANUS VACCINE
Aryo Sorayya
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA

Freeze-sensitive vaccines represent over 50% of the $749 million UNICEF spent on all vaccines in 2010, and with rate of exposure to freezing temperatures in developed and developing countries at 13.5% and 21.9%, respectively, millions of lives and dollars are lost every year.<br><br> In this work, a novel liposomal adjuvant consisting of a specific lipid composition was tested for developing a freeze-stable Tetanus vaccine using Tetanus Light Chain (TLC) as an antigen. Furthermore, the influence of particle charge on the efficacy of the adjuvant was explored. <br><br> The effects of multiple freeze-thaw cycles and lyophilization at -45 oC on the stability and immunogenicity of the liposomal vaccines were compared in mice. As control, a TLC solution without an adjuvant was used. The Tetanus toxoid antibodies (IgG) in the mice sera were measured by an Indirect ELISA, and a t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in immune response before and after lyophilization of the liposomes.<br><br> Both the liquid and lyophilized liposomal vaccines gave a significant immunogenic response in mice greater than that of the Tetanus solution without adjuvant. The positively charged liposomes gave the strongest immune response, with a 9-fold increase from that of the negatively charged liposomes. There was no significant difference in immune response of liposomal vaccines before and after lyophilization (p > 0.05). These vaccines did not lose their immunogenic activity despite freezing at -45 oC and might thus be used as alternatives to the current freeze-sensitive Tetanus vaccines in the market. <br><br> Such liposomes offer a novel approach for improving current vaccines, reducing the risks associated with accidental freezing, lowering costs, and ultimately saving more lives.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM ON THE PROLIFERATION AND INSULIN SECRETION OF PANCREATIC BETA CELLS IN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS
Rohan Anand Savoor
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA

Last year, the American Diabetes Association recognized 2.6 million people in the United States with Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM), a chronic autoimmune disease in which pancreatic beta cells are destroyed. This study investigated the role of extracellular calcium on the proliferation of MIN6 pancreatic beta cells, a cell line derived from transgenic mouse insulinoma. The source of calcium ions was Cinacalcet, an FDA-approved drug used for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism, that exhibits calcimimetic properties. The Cinacalcet used acts as an agonist to the Calcium Sensing Receptor, a Class C G-protein coupled receptor that has been shown to stimulate proliferation in numerous somatic cell types. Six sets of eight samples each of MIN6 cells were prepared. Three pairs of two sets each were treated with 1.0 µM concentration of their respective drugs: Cinacalcet, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, control), and NPS 2143 (negative control). The treatment was conducted for one 24-hour and one 48-hour period. After treatment, two anti-histone antibodies were added to each sample, which indicated the presence of replicating MIN6 cells. A Hoechst nuclear marker stained the proliferated MIN6 cells. Results from a one-tailed T-Test indicated that the Cinacalcet treatment induced statistically significant proliferation of MIN6 pancreatic beta cells relative to the DMSO control and NPS 2143 negative control after 48 hours (t(14)= 0.0261, p<0.05), (t(14)= 0.0419, p<0.05), respectively). The impact of these findings sheds light on a new branch of beta cell regeneration, which can be explored in pancreatic islets both in murine models and humans.

REGENERATIVE POTENTIAL OF HEALTHY VERSUS DIABETIC ADIPOSE-DERIVED STEM CELLS IN THE SETTING OF A BIOMIMETIC HYDROGEL SCAFFOLD
Anika Radiya-Dixit
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

Patients with diabetes pose a significantly impaired wound healing potential, partly due to the failure of diabetic tissues to re-vascularize oxygen-deprived areas of injury. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), an abundant and easily isolated source of adult mesenchymal stem cells, have been shown to promote neovascularization when applied to non-healing wounds, and are thought to act mainly through the release of pro-angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF. This research investigated the effect of diabetes on ASC behavior and pro-angiogenic potential in the setting of a 5% collagen-pullulan biomimetic hydrogel scaffold. The in vitro analyses demonstrated that while there is no significant difference between wild-type and diabetic ASC proliferation and survival following hydrogel seeding, diabetes does impair the morphology of the ASCs in this setting. Moreover, diabetic ASCs displayed a significantly lower expression of angiogenic cytokines compared to wild-type cells. This functional impairment was consistent with the in vivo findings, which demonstrated that hydrogels seeded with ASCs from wild-type mice significantly increased the rate of wound healing and tissue survival compared to hydrogels seeded with ASCs from diabetic mice. The experiment results demonstrated that diabetes significantly impairs the regenerative potential of ASCs in the setting of a therapeutic bioscaffold. This research provides valuable insights for the design of cell-based therapies for wound healing in high-risk diabetic patients.

COCOA POLYPHENOL EXTRACT INHIBITS INTERFERON-GAMMA PRODUCTION IN MURINE SPLENOCYTES
Minuoja Chandramohan
Ecole Marguerite-De Lajemmerais, Montreal, CANADA

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by increased production of T-helper-1 cell cytokines, including pro-inflammatory interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) which stimulates proliferation and differentiation of T cells. Cocoa polyphenol extract (CPE) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects on T cells, however CPE has not yet been investigated as a psoriasis treatment. Previous studies showed that CPE decreases IL-2 production but its effects on IFN-gamma are unknown. Thus, the effect of CPE on the production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by C57BL/6 murine splenocytes was investigated. In this experiment, polyphenols were extracted from pure cocoa powder and quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetric method. C57BL/6 splenocytes were isolated and treated with varying concentrations of CPE and were activated with phorbol myristoyl acetate and ionomycin. Cytokine productions were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Treatment of splenocytes with 20 µg/ml CPE resulted in significantly decreased IFN-gamma production (~82% decrease compared to solvent). In contrast, IL-2 production was increased by ~38% with 10 µg/ml CPE. The unexpected increase in IL-2 is likely the result of using a heterogeneous mixture of polyphenols: each polyphenol may have different effects. Further studies using CPE separated into its polyphenolic compounds, using high performance liquid chromatography, are needed. Finally, the present study demonstrates that CPE down-modulates IFN-gamma and could therefore be formulated into injections to treat psoriatic patients. Moreover, CPE could also be useful in treating a broader spectrum of disorders in which IFN-gamma is upregulated, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

MUSTARD OIL AS AN APICOMPLEXAN-TARGETING DRUG THERAPY FOR PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM
Jessie Leanne Preston MacAlpine
Huron Park Secondary School, Woodstock, CANADA

Half of the global population is susceptible to malarial infection, with over one million annual deaths occurring as a result of the disease. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, contains a vital plastid-organelle homologous to the chloroplasts of plants, known as the apicoplast. It was determined in previous studies that allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is able to inhibit plant growth in a variety of species through effects on photosynthetic function. The purpose of this experiment was thus to examine the antimalarial properties of mustard oil, a natural form of AITC used as cooking oil in developing countries. A one-step fluorescence assay used for antimalarial drug screening was employed throughout the experiment; resulting in the discovery that a 2µg/mL solution of pure mustard oil is able to significantly reduce Plasmodium falciparum infection in human red blood cells. Results of an MTT assay and light microscopy indicate that mustard oil exhibits equivalent mammalian toxicity to the common antimalarial drug Doxycycline. AITC is currently sold as an antibiotic, where clinical studies indicate that oral administration results in 90% absorption and rapid urinary drug recovery. With no organic solvent necessary, pure mustard oil (purchased from a local grocery) inhibits over 94% of parasite growth. Thus, the necessary dose of 10mg has potential to be taken orally, a treatment costing one million times less than the next leading antimalarial. Mustard oil production already occurs in malaria-endemic regions; including Brazil and India, making this cooking oil an inexpensive, accessible and effective alternative to current treatments.

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF PLATELET DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR IN THE FUNCTION OF GLIOBLASTOMA BRAIN TUMOR STEM CELLS
Sujay Nagaraj
Western Canada High School, Calgary, CANADA

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignancy found in adults. Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) are subpopulations of cancer cells with stem-like characteristics (namely, self-renewal ability and capacity for differentiation) which can lead to tumorigenesis, metastasis and even drug resistance. This research shows that Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF-AA) has a significant role in enhancing the self-renewal ability and reducing the capacity for differentiation of certain GBM BTSCs. Further, PDGFRalpha inhibition is shown to be a viable BTSC-targeted therapy.<br><br> PDGF-AA significantly increased the ability for these cells to form secondary neurospheres in vitro, suggesting that PDGF-AA enhances the self-renewal potential of these cells. Expression of differentiation and stem cell markers upon inoculation was assessed through immunocytochemistry. PDGF-AA significantly increased the expression of Nestin, a common marker of BTSCs. PDGF-AA also reduced expression of differentiated cells; Beta-tubulin (neuronal marker) expression and GFAP (astrocytic marker) expression was down-regulated amongst PDGF-AA treated samples. This lack of differentiation suggests that PDGF-AA preserves the stem-like characteristics of BTSCs by reducing the capacity for differentiation. <br><br> The PDGFRalpha receptor was also expressed in abundance and shines light towards possible targeted therapy for BTSCs. To validate this, BTSCs were treated with Tyrphostin AG 1296, a selective inhibitor of PDGFRalpha. Inhbition significantly reduced the self-renewal capacity of the BTSCs by preventing secondary neurosphere formation. Inhibition of this pathway may prove to be a viable BTSC-targeted therapy for patients with glioblastoma.

A SYNERGISTIC APPROACH IN TREATING CANCER VIA PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY AND HSP90 INHIBITION
Arjun Koodali Nair
Webber Academy, Calgary, CANADA

Photothermal therapy (PTT) utilizing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is poised to provide an alternative method to treating cancer, through their ability to convert photonic energy into localized thermal energy. However, the therapeutic effectiveness of PTT is attenuated by the upregulation of heat shock protein (HSP), which renature heat-denatured proteins, preventing cell death. This research identifies a solution for Hsp expression and optimizes PTT. A mathematical model was used to investigate Hsp regulation to evaluate the effectiveness of available Hsp90 inhibitors. 17-N-allylamino-17 demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was found to have Hsp inhibitory properties. To deliver 17-AAG and GNPs to the site of cancer, dual region loading was utilized via liposomes. Proof-of-concepts were developed and tested through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Cross Correlation Fluoroscopy (CCF). The loading of GNPs into liposomes was determined by DLS by analyzing the size distribution of particles in solution. CCF results indicated the incorporation of 17-AAG by using an analogous dye (Verteporfin) and a cross-reference species (Oregon Green). DLS results also showed that GNPs would cluster to form 60 nm aggregates post lysis of the liposome. This phenomenon is further evidenced by the ATP bioluminescence assay, which measured the viability of WT U343 Glioblastoma in response to therapeutic agents. Liposome encapsulated GNPs induced 22% more cell death than a sole GNP method of treatment. Findings further demonstrated that the combination of GNPs and 17-AAG worked synergistically resulting in 87% of cell death. This research sets the precedent for developing PTT as a multi-potent approach for the treatment of cancer.

BETA-AMYLOID IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
Ankita Saxena
Westmount Charter School, Calgary, CANADA

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques which are composed of beta- amyloid (Abeta) protein misfolded into beta-sheets. Little correlation has been found between the number of plaques and AD progression. Many now consider Abeta oligomers to be the neurotoxic species. In this study, these different structures of Abeta are investigated by using K114, a conformation (amyloid) specific probe and confocal spectral microscopy. This method resulted in the production of specific “spectral signatures” for different amyloid structures. Analysis revealed differences in Abeta packing intra-plaque and unique signatures from different sizes of plaques in AD transgenic (TG) mouse brain sections. These findings help elucidate the structure of these plaques and also preliminarily suggest that K114 staining and imaging may be a viable method for quantifying plaque age. Amyloid probing also revealed amyloid in tissue from other neurodegenerative diseases, with substantial amounts found on the periphery of lesions in mouse spinal cord injury tissue and smaller quantities in the white matter of pig trauma brains. This suggests a new, novel, role for Abeta in other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the creation and optimization of an oxidation protocol resulted in artificial crosslinking and tighter amyloid packing which was detected by the probe. This provides a novel method to possibly detect neurotoxic Abeta in a quantifiable manner which may be relevant in diagnosing AD and assessing the efficacy of drugs noninvasively. <br><br>

EFFECT OF GINSENG ON BETA-AMYLOID IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Xinyang Young Zhou
London Central Secondary School, London, CANADA

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurological brain disorder, closely associated with inflammatory events and the accumulation of plaques in the brain formed by protein fragments called beta-amyloid (AB) peptides. This project used provided fixed tissues obtained from eight 6-month old male Wistar rats (four from the treatment group and four from the control group gavaged daily with ginseng and water respectively for five weeks) to determine the effect of American ginseng on the quantities of AB deposits and microglial cells in the internal capsule (int) and basal forebrain (bf) sections of the rat brain. The results demonstrated that ginseng treatment reduced the mean number of AB deposits in the internal capsule section by 89% (from 105.75 to 11.25 deposits) and in the basal forebrain section by 87% (from 26.5 to 3.5 deposits). The differences are significant with t(6) = 10.232, p = 0.000 and t(4.381) = 5.039, p = 0.006. Ginseng treatment also increased the mean number of microglial cells in the internal capsule section by 107% (from 95.5 to 197.25 cells) and in the basal forebrain section by 297% (from 9.25 to 36.75 cells). The difference for the internal capsule is significant with t(6) = 3.163, p = 0.019 while the difference for the basal forebrain is not significant with t(6) = 1.333, p = 0.231. These results suggest that ginseng has potential to prevent the formation of AB, stimulate the immune system, and trigger the release of microglial cells to relieve the syndromes of Alzheimer’s disease.

ESTABLISHING A NOVEL PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF AUTISM AND CRYPTOGENIC EPILEPSY INDUCED BY TOXOPLASMA GONDII METABOLOMIC PATHWAYS TO ORIGINATE UNPRCEDENTED DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS
Mohammed Abdulfattah Aldajani
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dhahran, SAUDI ARABIA

Autism and cryptogenic epilepsy are serious brain disorders that have a significant prevalence rate in Saudi Arabia. Both diseases lack diagnostic laboratory biomarkers and specific lines of treatment. Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite infecting one third of the world’s population, induces lipid metabolism alterations and possesses abilities to degrade branched-chain amino acids in the host. These altered metabolomics are similar to those incriminated in the pathogenesis of autism and epilepsy. The study’s aim is to examine associations between Toxoplasma infection and the development of autism and epilepsy as well as to evaluate a set of related biomarkers as risk predictors for both diseases. 30 autistic, 50 epileptic, and 51 control patients were put through clinical evaluation and blood tests for anti-Toxoplasma antibodies, adiponectin, lipoproteins and branched-chain amino acids. The results indicated a significant role of Toxoplasma infection in the pathogenesis of both autism and epilepsy with a higher positivity rate (50% and 54% in autism & epilepsy respectively) and significantly higher anti-Toxo IgG levels relatively to healthy controls. All biomarkers have undergone a significant decrease under the influence of toxoplasmosis in Toxoplasma-positive autistic and epileptic patients compared to either controls or Toxoplasma-negative autistics or epileptics. Through logistic regression analysis, sets of 6 and 9 biomarkers were proven significantly predictive of autism and epilepsy respectively for more than 75% of the cases. The results confirmed the suggested hypothesis paving the way for an infectious basis of autism and epilepsy in addition to introducing a set of biomarkers with a diagnostic predictive ability.

LOOKING WITHIN THE LESION: TRANSCRIPTOME OF PSORIATIC SKIN REVEALS CHANGES IN APOPTOSIS SIGNALING AND GENES ASSOCIATED WITH ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Claudia Abrantes Mimoso
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

We identified genes associated with psoriasis pathogenesis. Widely used high-throughput microarray technologies have generated greatly varied psoriasis transcriptomes due to limited study sample sizes and different experimental designs. We used meta-analytic approach, which combined the results of individual studies of psoriasis transcriptomes. We defined the transcriptional differences between psoriasis lesional skin, non-lesional skin, and normal skin of healthy subjects by combining nine studies comprising 640 gene chips in GEO Datasets Bioinformatic search. Genechips were analyzed through several computer programs; RMAExpress, RankProd, DAVID, and Ingenuity in order to identify regulated genes and their gene ontologic annotations. 2000-3000 genes were found to be significantly regulated in psoriasis (p <0.001). In the transcriptome of lesional vs. non-lesional psoriasis skin, we discovered that apoptosis signaling is negatively regulated in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin (p<0.001) In transcriptome of non-lesional skin vs. normal skin, we found elevated expressions of genes related to atherosclerosis signaling, and pathways such as leukocyte extravasation (p<.0001) that are involved in systemic inflammatory diseases. Most interestingly, biomarkers for assessing atherosclerotic risk, including CD40, CD40LG, ALOX15, MMP9 and CXCR4 were shown to be up-regulated in the psoriasis nonlesional vs. normal transcriptome. Our results provide a rigorous base for identifying molecular pathways that contribute to psoriasis onset and identifying the risks of psoriasis patients for developing other systemic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis.

ANGIOPOIETIN-1 AND R-SPONDIN1 MITIGATE RADIATION INDUCED GASTROINTESTINAL SYNDROME
Brett Ingram Bell
Pelham Memorial High School, Pelham, NY

Normal homeostasis of the small intestine requires a combination of a cell replacement process beginning with crypt stem cell proliferation and maintenance of vascular stability; when this is interrupted by radiation damage, radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome occurs. Angiopoietin-1 and R-Spondin1 were hypothesized to play a role in mitigating radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome. Neither of these factors had previously been shown to be effective in mitigation of radiation damage to the small intestine. When administered to C57Bl/6 mice following irradiation at 16 Gray or at 18 Gray, Angiopoietin-1 reduced damage to the villi and crypts of the small intestine by maintaining vascular stability based on histological evidence. Angiopoietin-1 significantly increased longevity of life in treated animals and also increased intestinal absorption as evidenced by the Xylose Absorption Assay. Angiopoietin-1 upregulated cytokines in the small intestine indicating the mechanisms involved in mitigating intestinal damage. The biological trending shows that, based on increased longevity of life and intestinal absorption, Angiopoietin-1 and R-Spondin1 can each be concluded to be radiomitigating agents important in mitigating intestinal damage caused by unpredictable radiological incidents.

THE EFFECTS OF FCCP ON CALCIUM CHANNELS IN THE HEART
Ana Nicole Lanier
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

Carbonylcyanide-4- (trifluoromethoxy) -phenylhydrazone (FCCP) is a protonophore commonly used in pharmacological experiments. As a known mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases calcium currents. While in small doses ROS are healthy contributors to signaling in the cell, in large amounts they can cause damage to the cell by eliminating the membrane potential. This study was done to determine whether or not the ROS produced by FCCP were the cause of the decrease in calcium current. DTT, tempol, and glutathione, all ROS scavengers, were applied along with FCCP to see whether the suppression of the calcium current caused by FCCP would be stopped. Results showed that the effects of FCCP were partially reduced by the ROS scavengers. This suggests that there is another factor produced by FCCP that is causing the decrease in calcium current.

THE EFFECTS OF LACTOBACILLUS ACIDOPHILUS AND BIFIDOBACTERIUM INFANITS ON C9H13NO2.HCL IN RELATION TO AVAILABILITY OVER TIME
Delaney Rose Ahrens
Hernando High School, Brooksville, FL

The purpose of this research project is to see if combining a probiotic with a commonly used medicine affects the availability of the medicine in the body. <br><br>To compete this research project, I first combined the probiotics and the phenylephrine hydrochloride to create a chewable tablet. The tablets where then crushed up using a mortal and pistol. The samples were placed in a dissolution system and samples were pulled at five, thirty, sixty, ninety and one hundred and twenty minutes. The samples were then filtered and placed in HPLC vials and ran for thirty-six minutes per trial. <br><br>According to the average of all six trials, my experimental hypothesis was supported and my null hypothesis was rejected. My experimental hypothesis was when phenylephrine hydrochloride is combined with lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis, it positively affects the availability levels in the body over time. Although the original ESTD concentration is lower, by an average of 13.24%, but over a two-hour time frame the ESTD concentration stays higher than the industry standard half-life by 9.54%. Not only did the medicine work longer, the probiotic blend with phenylephrine hydrochloride passed industry standards for only phenylephrine hydrochloride. <br><br>The data collected, can be functional to both human cold/flu medicine and veterinary medicine. If my project was applied to modern medicine, the sick would need medicine less often because the medicine would work longer in the system, due to the increased half-life of the phenylephrine hydrochloride. Also, it has been proven that adding probiotics adds positive bacteria back into the flora that is often lost when taking a cold and flu medicine, and it decreases the time of the cold symptoms.

RNA BINDING ABILITY OF FUS MEDIATES TOXICITY IN A DROSOPHILA MODEL OF ALS
Senthil Srivatsan Natarajan
Haynes Academy for Advanced Studies, Metairie, LA

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons. Mutations in the Fused-in-Sarcoma (FUS) gene have been identified as a major component in both familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS) ALS cases. <br><br> Here I examined the role of RNA binding in mediating the neurodegenerative effects of mutant FUS via the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM). I hypothesized that disruption of its RNA binding ability by deletion of the RRM domain or by 4F-L mutations would reduce the toxicity of mutant FUS. I first tested the hypothesis by creating transgenic fly lines with a deletion of the RRM domain in FUS entirely (RRM-D). I next narrowed my focus and created transgenic lines in which I mutated 4 conserved phenylalanine residues within the FUS RRM to leucine (known as 4F-L). Both the RRM-D and 4F-L lines were used in screens in which the FUS trans-gene was expressed in the fly eyes and motor neurons.<br><br> Imaging and results show that deletion of the RRM domain and 4F-L mutations do indeed reduce neurodegeneration caused by FUS mutations. The eyes of “rescued” flies show far less degeneration and “rescued” flies display less pupal lethality and greater motility. This data indicates that RNA-binding is in fact critical for the toxicity of FUS. Imaging has shown that disrupting the RNA binding-ability causes mislocalization of FUS into the cytoplasm, further indicating that subcellular localization of FUS is a causative pathway for ALS. Western blots were also run to verify gene expression levels within the flies. In summary, there seems to be the identification of a means of rescuing phenotype in our Drosophila model of ALS-associated neurodegeneration, which may be relevant for future clinical studies and interventions in ALS.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CNS-SPECIFIC INTERLEUKIN 15 TRANSGENIC MICE
Aditya Khurana
North Canyon High School, Phoenix, AZ

Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder in which there is a breakdown of the blood brain barrier and an infiltration of lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). An accepted murine model of MS is the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Interleukin 15 is a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates to proliferation of immune cells, specifically T and NK cells Other studies have shown that IL-15-/- mice have more severe symptoms of EAE, showing a possible beneficial role this cytokine may have in the autoimmune response. This study will characterize a transgenic mouse with an overexpression of CNS specific IL-15 in order to determine the role that IL-15 plays in the autoimmune response in EAE. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to confirm the overexpression of IL-15 in IL-15 (+) mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize the expression of IL-15; IL-15 co-localizes with astrocytes. Following a 3 week observation period in which EAE was induced, FACS analysis showed that the lymphocyte and NK cell populations were higher in IL-15 (+) mice.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF R-ALPHA LIPOIC ACID ON EDELFOSINE'S ABILITY TO ERADICATE SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Samantha Marie Huckabee
Thayer R-II High School, Thayer, MO

Edelfosine is a chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of malignant tumors. Antioxidants, substances that may protect cells against the effects of free radicals, could possibly inhibit the eradication of cancer cells during chemotherapy. While researching cancer, I continually read that the main issue in cancer treatment is that it is not as effective as it should be. In order to increase the success rates, the overall diet, health and wellbeing of a cancer patient need to be analyzed. The purpose of my project is to establish the negative effects of R-alpha lipoic acid, a powerful antioxidant, on edelfosine, a chemotherapy drug's, ability to toxically kill Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In theory, this could decrease chemotherapy's ability to treat cancer. To carry out this experiment, I combined Saccharomyces cerevisiae with edelfosine and varying amounts of R-alpha lipoic acid. S.cerevisiae was used because it is eradicated by edelfosine at the same rate as a cancer cell. I used a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance, transmittance and concentration readings of the control group. My results implied that R-alpha lipoic acid does inhibit edelfosine's ability to eradicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This information could be vital to the medical community and patients seeking cancer treatment. In the future, I would like to further my research by testing my hypothesis on actual cancer cells. This study could also benefit from being tested on other chemotherapy drugs as well as other chemotherapy drugs to determine the the same implications occur in similar situations.

CT-BASED EVALUATION OF ULTRA-POROUS BETA-TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE IN EXTREMITY BONE DEFECTS AT ONE YEAR
Jay K. Khurana
Fayetteville-Manlius High School, Manlius, NY

Objectives: CT-based analysis of Ultraporous-Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP) synthetic graft (Vitoss) with and without bone marrow aspirate (BMA) in extremity bone defects at one year intervals post-procedure was performed prospectively. The goal was to evaluate if TCP incorporation was enhanced in smaller defects and in younger patients and if synthetic graft incorporation would advance at a slower rate in cortical bone compared to the medullary cavity. <br><br>Methods: Fifty-four patients with similar demographics and curetted benign bone lesions were randomly assigned to have their defects filled with either TCP or TCP with BMA. Twenty-one patients had CT scans available for digital analysis (TCP=10, TCP w/ BMA=11). CT scans were evaluated at intervals of one year. Mimics® software was used to derive and analyze endpoints related to TCP incorporation. Additional endpoints were analyzed for patients with multiple CT scans. <br><br>Results: The original TCP volume showed a quadratic relationship (r^2=0.979) with the residual TCP (slower bone growth>40cm^3). The age at the time of grafting was inversely related to the fractional defect ratio change (r^2=0.871) and fractional average diameter change (r^2=0.879) but did not show any relationship with the average bone regrowth (r^2=0.0357). However, in both TCP with and without BMA the bone regrowth ratio (p=0.395) and the bone defect ratio (p=0.497) were not significantly different. <br><br>Conclusions: TCP incorporation proceeds at a greater rate for smaller defects and younger patients. However, there was no significant evidence that synthetic graft incorporation advances at a greater rate in cortical bone compared to the medullary cavity.

COLORIMETRIC DETECTION OF PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM VIA APTASENSOR TECHNOLOGY
Junyi (Sarah) Wu
Assumption College School, Brantford, CANADA

Where sophisticated diagnostic methods for malaria are not readily accessible, the disease is often confirmed based on symptoms such as high fever. This can result in misdiagnosis, and subsequently increased drug resistance. Although rapid diagnostic tests have been recommended, these antibody-based assays are limited by their high cost and instability. The goal was to develop a novel, cost-effective diagnostic method for the most common and dangerous strain of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, through the simple and sensitive detection of the Plasmodium falciparum Histidine Rich Protein II (PfHRP2) using aptamer-gold nanoparticle conjugates. It was predicted that in the presence of PfHRP2, PfHRP2 specific aptamer-gold nanoparticles would bind to the protein, forming red dots due to the unique optical properties of gold. The sensitivity was improved with a silver enhancement solution that amplified the gold nanoparticle label. The conjugation of thiolated oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles was followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy characterization. The actual test involved four steps: 1) immobilization of the sample onto nitrocellulose membrane 2) incubation with blocking buffer 3) incubation with aptamer-gold nanoparticle conjugates 4) silver enhancement. The results demonstrate the ability of aptamer-gold nanoparticle conjugates to bind to PfHRP2, introducing the first aptasensor colorimetric detection method for Plasmodium falciparum. As aptamers emerge as a worthy alternative to antibodies, an aptamer-based test could become more effective and feasible than its antibody counterpart. The proposed method’s simplicity results in minimal equipment and required training, thus presenting a potential solution for widespread distribution in developing nations.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS: A MARKOV MODEL
Kerttu Katarina Uusimaki
Paivola Upper Secondary School, Tarttila, FINLAND

In this research I created a Markov model to estimate the effectiveness of the treatment of anorexia nervosa.<br><br> About 1% of girls and young women of the age 12-24 suffer from anorexia nervosa. There have been studies, especially quantitative ones, but no mathematical models were found. The Markov chain is a common method to estimate the behavior of stochastic processes. The states of the Markov Model were chosen to be: “healthy”, “weight control problem”, “anorectic in non-institutional care”, “anorectic in institutional care”, “anorectic in involuntary treatment”, “premature death caused by anorexia”, “ anorectic without treatment”, “cured from acute anorexia” and “other death”. The patients’ state transition probabilities were calculated to fit present Finnish data found in public, openly available sources.<br><br> The model gives approximate values on the effectiveness of the different treatments and prevention of anorexia nervosa. The model can be used as a tool for decision making. The model was tested on a theoretical case where additional resources were placed on treating the early symptoms of anorexia and the number of girls getting anorexia lessens. The transition probabilities in the model were changed accordingly. As a result the costs dropped three million euro and the mortality rate dropped from the current 16 to 12,7.<br><br> In further studies the parameters of the model, the state transition probabilities, could be improved considerably with more accurate analysis of the effectiveness of different treatments and more accurate frequencies. This would require medical expert’s opinions and access to clinical data.

USING HIGH THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING TO FIND TORQUE TENO VIRUSES IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM MOTHERS OF LEUKEMIC CHILDREN
Josefine Erika Wahlstrom
Bladins Gymnasium, Malmo, SWEDEN

Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer but the etiology of this disease is still unknown. A recurring etiological factor is chromosomal translocations. However, these may have several etiologies. One of which is a triggering viral infection. Well-known studies by Harald zur Hausen and Ethel-Michele de Villiers indicate a vertical viral infection with Torque Teno viruses causing chromosomal translocation. Zur Hausen’s hypothesis is that the first infection comes from the mother and we therefore used sera from mothers of leukemic children in this study. Using High Throughput Sequencing we looked for Torque Teno Viruses in serum samples to see which types and subspecies were present. We found 29 new putative Torque Teno Viruses types, 19 were alleged different subspecies and out of these, 4 were new Torque Teno Viruses species. In this study, we showed that High Throughput Sequencing can be used to identify known and unknown Torque Teno Virus-types in serum samples. This, may one day aid in finding a correlation between childhood leukemia and Torque Teno Viruses.

ANALYSIS OF HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN CANNED TUNA FISH
Genesis Ayala-De Leon
Petra Mercado Bougart, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

A healthy life can be enjoyed by having a balanced diet where the consumption of fish and sea food is highly recommended. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), sea food have high quality proteins and many other essential nutrients which are low in saturated fat and contain omega-3. The recommended portion is 6 ounces a week. However, it is known that sea food consumption is one of the main gateways of mercury to the organism. The purpose of this investigation is analyze the concentrations of heavy metals in canned tuna fish. The hypothesis was that concentrations of heavy metals in canned tuna fish will be low. Three samples per tuna fish cans were taken from 2 different lots of the main brands available in Puerto Rico and the United States. The 18 samples were labeled as A1a, A1b, A1c, A2a, A2b, A2c; B1a, B1b, B1c, B2a, B2b, B2c; C1a, C1b, C1c, C2a, C2b, C2c and were subjected to electrochemical tests for mercury, cadmium and lead; and mercury’s atomic absorption. The results were compared to EPA and FDA standards. The electrochemical test was not effective for it only detected concentrations above 20ppm. This data was verified by the atomic absorption test for mercury, and the concentrations were on the range of 0.12ppm to 0.51 ppm (mg/L). The hypothesis was accepted, concluding that canned tuna fish is safe for consumption. Nevertheless, the consumption frequency should be controlled because heavy metals accumulate in the body.

ABERRANT METHYLATION OF THE RASSF1A GENE AS A BIOMARKER FOR THE DETECTION OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
Lijia Xie
North Penn High School, Lansdale, PA

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world with over 600,000 deaths annually. Highly prevalent in Asia and Africa, the five-year survival rate of the cancer is a mere 5-10% due to a lack of early detection: the only currently approved detection method, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), is only 40-60% sensitive. Previous studies have shown the methylated RASSF1A gene as a potential early biomarker for HCC; however, we and others have also suggested that the location of CpG methylation analysis could impact the marker’s performance in distinguishing HCC from other liver diseases. In this study, we used bisulfite DNA sequencing to analyze the methylation profiles of 59 CpG sites within three regions of the gene’s promoter in normal, diseased, and cancerous liver tissue and normal non-liver tissue and identify a region (P1) that is most specific to HCC, then validated these findings by methylation specific PCR in a larger sample size. Next, to translate these findings into potential HCC screening, we further developed PCR assays to detect mRASSF1A in urine of patients with HCC with 90% sensitivity and specificity. We also developed a target-enriched next-generation sequencing platform for a high-throughput, multiplex urine assay that was validated by fold enrichment analysis. These urine assays, in combination with other DNA markers, can not only detect AFP-negative HCC, but increase sensitivity in detecting AFP-positive HCC when used in combination with serum AFP.

MACHINE LEARNING USING GENOMIC FEATURES IMPROVES GLEASON-BASED PROSTATE CANCER PROGNOSIS
Joshua Ruohua Li
Upper Dublin High School, Fort Washington, PA

Prostate cancer is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. In clinical practice, Gleason score is commonly used to assign patients into low, intermediate, or high risk groups based on their cancer’s histological appearance under microscope. Whereas aggressive treatment is often opted for high risk patients and a “wait and see” approach is preferred for low risk patients, it is the patients with an intermediate Gleason score who are left in the “treat or not to treat” dilemma. Therefore, identifying new prognosis predictors at the molecular level could bring real benefits to those patients. Searching the public NCBI GEO gene expression data library, I found a dataset of 281 men in a Swedish "Watchful Waiting" cohort. By analyzing differentially expressed genes between patients who died within 5 years (lethal) and those who survived for >10 years without metastasis (indolent) in the intermediate risk group, I developed an 8-gene prediction model using the Naïve Bayes classifier in WEKA, an open source machine learning software. This model can predict lethal cancers versus indolent ones with an accuracy of 75%-82%. The results show that machine learning using genomic features may provide a promising approach to prostate cancer prognosis. If further confirmed, this approach can provide valuable information in addition to the traditional Gleason score to improve clinical decision making. It will also help patients avoid harmful over-treatment and help society reduce healthcare cost for prostate cancer, which totals 12 billion dollars annually.

NOVEL NANOPARTICLES FOR DRUG DELIVERY
Kishore Balasubramanian
Klein Oak High School, Spring, TX

The treatment of Glioblastoma, is a daunting task due to the extremely selective nature of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). The purpose of this project was to synthesize Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) from clarified butter and evaluate its efficiency in encapsulating and delivering Temozolomide in treating Glioblastoma.<br><br> SLNs with varying amount of surfactant (Tween 80) and lipids (clarified butter) were synthesized with a constant amount of Temozolomide. The entrapment efficiencies of each formulation were analyzed and compared. DLS was used to analyze particle size and structure. An MTT Assay was conducted to determine the toxicity of the drug loaded nanoparticles. The efficacy of the SLNs in delivering Temozolomide across the BBB was evaluated by constructing twelve human BBB models. HUVEC cells were plated on TransWell plates with special astrocyte spiked media in order to simulate the tight junctions and selectivity which is characteristic of the human BBB. Six BBB models were treated with Temozolomide loaded SLNs and the remaining BBB models were treated with conventional Temozolomide solution. UV spectroscopy was used to calculate the amount of drug that passed through the BBB. <br><br> The results showed that the nanoparticles made from clarified butter had a high encapsulation efficiency of 67% and were 100% more efficient in delivering Temozolomide across the BBB than the conventional drug delivery method. Based on these results, it can be concluded that using SLNs as a drug carrier is a more promising solution in the treatment of CNS related diseases, such as Glioblastoma.

EXAMINING THE DRUG METABOLIZING ENZYME NQO1 IN THE GERIATRIC LIVER
Lorna-Leigh Haruko Kaneshiro
James Bicknell Castle High School, Kaneohe, HI

The liver is an important organ in the body that is responsible for detoxification, drug handling, protein synthesizing and producing bio-chemicals. In order for the liver to function, metabolism takes place; preventing damage by removing foreign chemicals. In drug metabolism, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone also known as NQO1 is an enzyme that in the cell’s cytoplasm. The NQO1 prevents the one electron reduction of quinones which produce reactive species, and instead performs 2-electron reduction to a safe metabolite. Problems with NQO1 enzymes have been associated with increased susceptibility to cancer, an increased risk of blood disorders and diseases of ageing such as Alzheimers. This project tests to see if NQO1 enzyme proteins in the liver decline with age. The reason for this is because lower expression and activity of NQO1 in the elderly could possibly explain pathogenesis of diseases relating to cancer and ageing. NQO1 also regulates and metabolizes anti-cancer drugs which may have implications for the doses and types of drugs used for the elderly. I will be using processed human liver samples consisting of livers aged 65+ and comparing to a pool of 200 livers from ages 21-64. The goal of this project is to discover if the elderly are susceptible to cancer and other toxicities relating to lowered levels of NQO1 in liver.

MENIN CONTROLLED CELL DIFFERENTIATION, RENEWAL, AND TRANSFORMATION OF NORMAL AND NEOPLASTIC STEM CELLS
Haoxuan Yuan
Pelham Memorial High School, Pelham, NY

The multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is associated with abnormal vasculature and caused by a mutation in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in the inactivation of menin, a protein product of MEN1. However, the molecular pathogenesis of the MEN1 syndrome remains unknown. The most recent studies show that the abnormal self-renewal, transformation, and differentiation of stem cells may play an important role in the tumorigenesis. The aim of this proposed project is to explore the role of menin inactivation in the initiation and the development of endocrine tumors. Using a developed Pdx1-Cre:Men1 floxed/floxed conditional knockout mouse model and the state of art techniques, it was demonstrated that the inactivation of menin resulted in significantly increased tumor cell growth, self-renewal, and abnormal differentiation of islet stem cells. The self-renewal and abnormal differentiation of the islet stem cells also further promote tumor angiogenesis in tumor microenvironment by vascular endothelial group factor (VEGF) expression and vascular endothelial cell proliferation. Menin can therefore control the self-renewal, transformation, and differentiation of islet stem cells, an association that will provide important and novel insight in the treatment of MEN1 patients as well as other cancer patients.

THE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE ON REACTION TIME
Wyatt Luke Limke
Berthold High School, Berthold, ND

The purpose of this study was to determine if how much does caffeine affect your reaction time and when you are drowsy, does caffeine have a greater effect on the time it takes for you to react to a certain stimuli. To test these results the participants in this study were instructed to abstain from consuming caffeine for three days leading up to the experiment. They also were instructed to get eight hours of sleep each of the three nights leading up to the study. They recorded what time they woke up on the day of the tests. First a baseline test was conducted to see what their reaction time was without any caffeine in their system. Then another test was performed once the caffeine had been ingested. Once the participants had been awake for sixteen hours, another baseline test was done. Then another test was conducted once the caffeine had been consumed. The results of this study shows that caffeine does decrease people's reaction time. On average, the participants' reaction time was reduced by 16.16 percent in the first wave of tests and 27.59 percent in the second wave of tests. I have concluded this is because of buildup of adenosine in the body throughout the day and how the caffeine interferes with the adenosine binding to the adenosine receptors in the brain. Other studies have shown that extra adenosine in the blood supply gives you more energy and alertness. This study backs that information.

DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM- NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR LUNG CANCER USING VOCS
Anishaa Sivakumar
Franklin Regional Senior High School, Murrysville, PA

Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate in America. This is especially true for women, with 60-80% of diagnoses being made in stage 4, in which the 5-year survival rate is only 10%. The only truly effective diagnostic tools at this time are high resolution CT scans and good histories and physicals which, currently, have not improved early diagnosis of Lung Cancer or mortality rate. Therefore the only way to decrease mortality rate is to find an early-stage diagnostic tool for lung cancer. My research has led me to Dictyostelium Discoideum, more commonly known as Slime Mold. Slime Mold is a unique protest that has the ability to use Chemotaxis to maneuver to a food source. During my research, I also learned that dogs detected lung cancer in the breaths of patients by sensing a VOC, or Volatile Organic Compound. I therefore came up with the idea of combining the two by utilizing the VOC to ascertain the effect on the slime mold growth towards a food source. The interference with slime mold’s directional growth was quantifiable. All 4 of the Single Blind Studies showed the same results, proving the inhibitory effect of lung cancer breath samples on slime mold growth. With a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 78%, and a two tailed P Value of less than .0001, my study showed that Dictyostelium Discoideum is an inexpensive, safe, and very efficient early-stage diagnostic tool for lung cancer.

INFLUENCE OF HEMISPHERIC SYNCHRONIZATION ON FUNCTIONING OF THE BRAIN
Kinga Panasiewicz
High School in the Name of Stanislaw Staszic, Hrubieszow, POLAND

This project focuses on brain asymmetry- functional differences of cerebral hemispheres. Due to the distributed organization of cognitive functions systems, specialized areas in the brain have to communicate by means of neural synchronization. The aim of my research is to determine whether doing activities which demand a very strong cooperation of cerebral hemispheres is a possible mechanism of increasing long-range neural synchrony in the brain. <br><br> The research is based on a behaviuoral laboratory experiment and non-invasive clinical studies. The first step was to recruit research participants and indicate which hemisphere is dominant in each's brain. I planned a series of control experiments to define brain abilities (perception and memorizing tasks, logical and creative thinking challenges, etc.). After this stage, I designed hemispheric synchronization activities program, which research participants were realizing constantly for several weeks. Moreover, every week research sessions were organized in order to carry out the control experiments, as well as observe bioelectric activity of the brain by means of EEG. <br><br> The data collected during the research provide evidence that accordingly adapted set of synchronization exercises leads to the improvement of cognition abilities and various behavioural performances. Furthermore, EEG measurements revealed a more balanced brain work in people who were doing the activities than in controls. I noticed increased participation of alpha waves and highly synchronized oscillatory activity in gamma-band in the experimental group. <br><br> Due to the impaired neural synchrony in people who suffer from various neuropsychiatric diseases, these findings may be applied to increasing brain abilities and supporting medical therapy and treatment.

Due to the several attempts of selling expired medicine in Lebanon, I have decided to do this research project. In fact the intake of expired medication can lead to very serious issues that would sooner or later wreck the patient’s well being. The invention/mechanism I have developed would eventually suppress the people attempting to do such corrupt action that would adulterate the health of innocent citizen. In addition, this mechanism will help paramedical and pharmaceutical staff in Lebanon to manage their medicine stocks in an easier and quicker method than with the classic one; moreover, it would facilitate the life of people with impaired vision (mainly seniors).<br><br>Once the medicine in question is produced and boxed, the ink cartridge mechanism on the package should be activated. (Ink cartridge and fabric shall be selected with respect to time lapse till the expiry date)<br><br>Instantly, the ink is slowly absorbed and the strip will be entirely tinted soon propagating the ink to the box. That occurs because of inter-molecular attractive forces between the liquid and solid surrounding surfaces. <br><br>Not only does that system signal the expiry date, but it also enhances the perception of time passing.<br><br> After the complete ink propagation throughout the absorbent strip, it will be explicit that the “inked” box is no longer utilizable or suitable to be purchased by a common consumer.

IDENTIFICATION OF SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS IN GENES ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Harshonnati Jain

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mutations in the gene that result in a single base change, can have a major impact on how humans respond to disease, environmental factors, and medicines. The objectives of this project were to identify SNPs in two of the genes, amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE), associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using bioinformatics techniques and to determine the potential of these SNPs to cause damage using SIFT scores and Log-odds matrices.<br><br>A search in the public database, dbSNP belonging to NCBI revealed the presence of at least 103 SNPs and 6299 SNPs in APP. Using GeneView and VarView, 30 of the SNPs in APOE were found to be non-synonymous (nsSNP) and 103 SNPs in APP were found to be non-synonymous. The SIFT analysis indicated that there were 18 nsSNPs damaging in APOE and all 5 nsSNPs for which SIFT scores were available in APP were found to be damaging. Based on homologue and orthologue alignments, 6 of the nsSNPs in APOE and 2 of the nsSNPs in APP were found to be most damaging. <br><br>Based on Log-odds scores, 3 of the most damaging nsSNPs in APOE had a low frequency of occurrence, therefore leaving only 3 nsSNPs in this gene that may be strongly associated with the development of AD. The Log-odds scores revealed that both nsSNPs found to be most damaging in APP had a random frequency of occurrence, meaning that both are strongly associated with the After noting the transcript mutations, G>A and C>T were the most frequent SNPs in both genes. <br><br>Identification of SNPs most likely to result in the development of AD could lead to timely diagnosis and treatment of the disease. However, more research needs to be done to determine the link between the SNPs and the potential for developing the disease in an individual. Future research includes identifying new SNPs in the genes that are continuously being reported into the NCBI database. Additional methods of estimating probability of these SNPs being damaging will be used, and also the location of the mutations identified in the domain or motif regions of the protein will confirm that the SNPs are linked to the development of the disease.

PHYTOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF TARAXACUM OFFICINALE ON HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
Lisa Fu
John Marshall High School, Rochester, MN

Being one of the most abundant weed species in North America, the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) has become the bane of immaculate lawn enthusiasts. However, albeit frequently regarded as a pesky nuisance, T. officinale extracts have actually been evidenced to possess a multitude of medicinal, antioxidant, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The utilization of plant-derived natural products signifies the importance in the discovery and cultivation of potentional medicinal agents, such as the dandelion. This study investigated the impact of dandelions on the growth and nuclear morphology of Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Three extracts (flower, leaf, and root) were prepared and tested in increasing concentrations and durations. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were identified and counted using fluorescence microscopy. On average, root extract inhibited 90% of cells at the highest concentration by 24 hours, while leaves and flowers inhibited 56% and 49%, respectively (p<0.01). In the trials that tested time-dependency of action (2, 4, and 6 hours), root extract inhibited 81% of cells within the first 6 hours of treatment, while leaf inhibited 34% by 6 hours, and flower extract inhibited no significant change (p<0.01). Therefore, this study proposes that dandelion extracts, specifically root extract, are worthy of further investigation as both a lethal and fast acting potential anti-carcinogenic agent.

ELIMINATION OF POSITIONAL DISCONTINUITY IN REGENERATING LIMBS
Kamna Gupta
Carmel High School, Carmel, IN

The salamander Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) regenerates amputated limbs by reprogramming limb cells to form an undifferentiated blastema that grows and redifferentiates into the missing limb parts. The base of the blastema carries a positional identity of its origin on the proximodistal (PD), anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes and fills in all the distal missing positional identities during regeneration. Reversal of the AP or DV axes of the blastema with respect to the limb stump creates discontinuities in positional identity on either side of the limb that stimulate regeneration of supernumerary limbs from the PD level of amputation. I hypothesized that the PD positional identities of the reversed blastema and limb stump must not be discontinuous in order for such supernumeraries to form. To test this hypothesis, I grafted distal zeugopodial blastemas to mid-stylopodial limb stumps while simultaneously reversing their AP or DV axis, thus making both PD and AP or DV discontinuities. The result was that supernumeraries could not form from the mid-stylopodial level. Instead, the PD discontinuity first had to be eliminated by intercalation to the level of origin of the grafted blastema, whereupon supernumerary digits were now able to form. This result indicates that every PD positional identity has corresponding AP and DV identities that must be "matched" in order for supernumerary formation to occur. The necessity for matching helps us to understand the cellular interactions necessary for limb regeneration. This research will help develop strategies for regenerating gaps in tissues and appendages. In the next phase of my research I would like to re-conduct this experiment by grafting proximal blastema distally instead of distal blastemas proximally.

COTA THE TUMORS: THELESPERMA MEGAPOTAMICUM VS. EPIDERMAL IRRITATION OF LUMBRISCUS TERRESTRIS
Priscilla Raeann Martinez
Taos High School, Taos, NM

Cota, or Hopi/Navajo Tea (Thelesperma megapotamicum) is a traditional plant medicine that has been used by Native American tribes for centuries. This tea also has indications for preventing cancer, due to antioxidants in the plant. The focus of this project is to determine if Cota can minimize tumor growth and swelling, as well as prevent cellular contamination in the presence of a potential carcinogen (tobacco).<br><br>Hypothetically, the Cota should be able to prevent tumor formation and epidermal irritation on Lumbricus terrestris, as well as reduce or eradicate tumor formation and epidermal swelling produced by tobacco exposure and that the flower will be the most effective at reducing worm edema and tumor formation.<br><br>Worms were placed in soil with dandelion stems as food. 1g of Cota stems and flowers were boiled separately at 80 deg.C to produce an extract. One set of trials were given Cota then .5g tobacco in the soil, while the others were exposed to tobacco first, and then subjected to Cota. The worms were monitored and measured daily. <br><br>The majority of worms that were exposed to Cota first had minimal edema and tumor formation. The worms given tobacco first then Cota, had a higher mortality rate, but there was evidence of tumor and edema shrinkage within 24 hours of introducing the Cota. There was far less mortality than the straight tobacco. The flower had the most impact with both worms. This data supports the hypotheses as stated.

PREVENTING THE GROWTH OF AEROMONAS SOBRIA WITH CIPROFLOXACIN, BACITRACIN, AND OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTISEPTICS
Julia Carol Nahman
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether Ciprofloxacin, Bacitracin, hand sanitizer or over-the-counter antiseptics would be the most effective in preventing the growth of Aeromonas sobria bacteria. To test this, 29 petri dishes were inoculated with A.sobria. Six of the inoculated dishes contained 3 Bacitracin disks each, 6 contained 3 Ciprofloxacin disks each, 5 contained 1 hand sanitizer disk each, 5 contained 1 first aid antimicrobial gel disk each, and 5 contained 1 antibiotic free first aid gel disk each. The remaining inoculated petri dishes served as controls having no exposure to disks. To ensure that bacteria growth was due to the A.sobria culture, 9 other dishes were not inoculated and contained only medicated disks. These served as additional controls. All petri dishes were incubated at body temperature for 48 hours. The average diameters of the rings of inhibition for the first aid antimicrobial gel disks as well as those of the antibiotic free first aid gel disks, and hand sanitizer disks were all 0. The average inhibition zone for the Ciprofloxacin disks was 3.46 and while the Bacitracin disks had inhibition zones of 649 cm. Though both Ciprofloxacin and Bacitracin are recommended for the treatment of A.sobria, the bacteria is more resistant to the Bacitracin and sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, thereby proving the hypothesis that Ciprofloxacin is more effective in preventing the spread of A.sobria. Both hand sanitizer and over-the-counter antiseptics are not effective in preventing the spread of A.sobria bacteria. Standard t-tests were run to validate the relationship between the data and conclusion.

INHIBITION OF MYELOPEROXIDASE (MPO)-MEDIATED OXIDATION OF LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) BY EXTRACT OF OCIMUM TENUIFLORUM AND ITS CHEMICAL COMPONENT, EUGENOL: POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR ANTI-ATHEROSCLEROTIC EFFECTS
Sangamithra Vardhan
West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

Atherosclerosis is a cardiac condition that leads into cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of mortality in the world. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an immune system enzyme that generates oxidants like hypochlorous acid that damage lipoproteins, such as LDL and HDL, in the blood leading to the formation of plaques in the artery wall, thus inducing atherosclerosis. This project tested if extracts of Ocimum tenuiflorum (Holy Basil) and Eugenol (the main component of O.tenuiflorum) can inhibit MPO oxidative activity. Three different spectrophotometric MPO enzymatic assays, utilizing reactions of MPO oxidation of different substrates, were used to test the inhibition of MPO activity by Holy Basil and Eugenol at various concentrations. A higher absorbance value indicates higher oxidation of the substrates by MPO. The TMB substrate assay results showed significant inhibition of MPO oxidative activity by Holy Basil (.25 microliter to 10 microliter) and Eugenol (.25 micro molar to 10 micro molar). The Guaiacol substrate assay showed that only lower concentrations of Holy Basil (0.25 microliter, 0.5 microliter, and 1 microliter) and 0.5 micro molar of Eugenol significantly inhibited MPO oxidation. The third assay spectrophotometrically measured conjugated dienes, the products of lipid peroxidation of LDL and HDL by MPO. The results showed significant inhibition of MPO oxidation by Holy Basil (5 microliter, 25 microliter) and Eugenol (5 micro molar, 25 micro molar). Two tailed t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance (with p-values less than 0.05). In conclusion, Holy Basil and Eugenol can inhibit MPO oxidation and thus can offer simple and affordable cardioprotection as a possible treatment for atherosclerosis.

THE INTERSECTION OF THE HGF/C-MET AND COX-2 PATHWAYS IN LUNG CANCER
Nathan Keli'ionalani Kennedy Lee
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women in the US. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met play an important role in the proliferation and invasiveness of lung tumors through induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 is involved in the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) leading to faster cell division and increased motility. It has been shown that induction of COX-2 and the subsequent PGE2 increase leads to TGF-alpha release, resulting in HGF-independent phosphorylation of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met. The goal of this project was to further understand the mechanism of interaction between the HGF/c-Met, EGFR and COX-2 pathways in lung cancer. The aims of the project were to examine at COX-2 induction by HGF and EGF, the effects of inhibitors crizotinib and celecoxib and to look for EMT alterations. Preliminary results suggest that the inhibitors significantly reduce cell proliferation and that that dual targeting of the COX-2 and c-Met pathways may be beneficial for lung cancer treatment.

ARE NICHE CELLS CRITICAL FOR BONE MARROW FAILURE?: A NOVEL APPROACH TO TRACING A DEFECTIVE BONE MARROW AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF LIFE-THREATENING BLOOD DISEASES
Roshni Bag
University High School of Indiana, Carmel, IN

Blood diseases account for over 100,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. A very common problem associated with blood diseases is bone marrow failure, where the bone marrow does not make any or enough blood cells. Currently, although bone marrow disorders are primarily treated through drugs and bone marrow transplants, the root cause of bone marrow disorders is not well understood. The core objective of my study was to determine, what is the root cause of bone marrow failure? <br><br>I chose Fanconi Anemia (FA) as the model of my study because it is a blood disease with >90% chance of developing bone marrow failure starting from childhood. Stem cell niche is the sheltering microenvironment for stem cells, and maintains a balance between stem cell dormancy and activity. I hypothesized, that if the niche itself becomes defective, then it might impair stem cell functions, which in turn may cause bone marrow failure. <br><br>I used a murine model with a knockout of 2 Fanc genes to simulate defective niche in FA, and studied the functions of mechenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are “niche cells”. <br><br>My results demonstrate that compared to the control, defective niche cells cause several defects in the bone, and have deficiencies in their cellular functions and differentiating capabilities. Previous to this study, niche cells had not been attributed to the pathogenesis of the bone marrow failure, making the results a novel discovery. These findings are significant because they provide important clues for disease diagnosis and therapeutic maneuver.

IS OVARIAN CANCER LINKED TO OBESITY?
Brianne Marie Flanagan
Edwardsburg High School, Edwardsburg, MI

This project was conducted to see if obesity is a risk factor for the development and spread of ovarian cancer. With the results of this experiment, I hope to raise awareness about ovarian cancer, as well as to hopefully reduce the percentage of women with ovarian cancer. To do this, there were several slides made with the tissue of the mouse organs, which were stained with HE and Oil-Red to show the basic structure of the tissue, as well as any lipids. These tissues, once stained, were studied under a scanning microscope. Afterwards, the tissues were scanned into an online database, where they could be stored until they were able to be analyzed. The tissues were analyzed using a software that counted the number of lipids. The size of the lipids was also recorded in the data given from this software. Once analyzed by the software, the data was examined to see if there was a significant relationship between the number of lipids and the number of tumors that the mice had. The final results for this experiment show that the control (fit) mice actually had more tumors than the western (obese) mice did. It is unknown at this point if this is going to be the typical result. More research is needed to finalize the data.

A SCREEN FOR GENES REGULATING LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Wisam Muhamad Buti
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS

The human PEXIN 1(PEX1) gene encodes the Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 1 (Pex1p) protein crucial for the formation and function of peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are required for normal brain development and myelin synthesis. Mutations of the PEX1 gene are the most common cause of Zellweger spectrum disorders. Metabolic and neurological abnormalities of the syndrome begin during early fetal stages of human development. Consequently, medical treatments to correct these abnormalities are limited. Since approximately 75% of identified genes in Drosophila are conserved in humans, the simple fruit fly harbors the potential to help advance therapies to treat human diseases such as Zellweger’s Syndrome. In order to identify new genes that are implicated in the etiology of neurological diseases, the behavioral screen first identified a third chromosomal deficiency line of flies, Df(3L)ED4529, that exhibited geotactic defects. To identify the gene or genes whose loss resulted in those defects, mutants of each gene candidate deleted from Df(3L)ED4529 were subjected to a simple geotaxis assay and the pex1 mutant, a Drosophila homolog of PEX1, exhibited geotactic defects (Honors College Thesis, Brown, 2011). Both the Df(3L)ED4529 and pex1 mutants were then subjected to extensive geotaxis and locomotor assays using the Noldus Ethovision XT8 tracking system, a highly sensitive monitoring device. The Df(3L)ED4529 mutants exhibited seizure activity as well as deficits in geotaxis and locomotor behaviors in comparison with control flies. pex1 female mutants exhibited a minor, yet significant degree of seizure activity while exhibiting normal locomotor behaviors. Future research will involve modifying the behavioral assay to optimize for the detection of the seizure activity and isogenizing the pex1 mutant strain. In addition, other mutant alleles of genes deleted from Df(3L)ED4529 will be assayed using the Noldus tracking system.

TOPICAL ACIDIFIED NITRITE: POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE
Christian Spencer Minton
Timpview High School, Provo, UT

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a common disorder with a progressive reduction in the lower limb blood flow. Dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) (a vasodilator) production in the endothelial lining of the blood vessel is felt to be a major contributor. Current therapies to increase NO production have been unsuccessful. I hypothesized that topical applications of NO-releasing acidified nitrite gel would lead to systemic hemodynamic changes including arterial dilation.<br><br>Over a two-year period, I developed 15 different acidified notrite gels with varying sodium nitrite concentrations and type/concentration of acids. I performed both control and patient site NO kinetics.<br><br>A single Volunteer, with informed consent, had eight studies performed varying gel formulation and application sites. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, methemoglobin saturation, and tissue perfusion were studied pre application and post application at 5 to 15 minute intervals until two hours post application. From these studies, I found released NO penetrated the skin and was absorbed into the blood vessels. There was a rapid and significant affect in systemic hemodynamic parameters. Limb peripheral perfusion was increased (short term) indicating systemic vasodilation. Blood methemoglobin always remained in the safe range. <br><br>After establishing the two most effective gels, I studied 10 volunteers. I defined their hymodynamic effects, limb perfusion, and NO kinetics.<br><br>Conclusion: These findings are suggestive that the topical NO administration might provide an alternative to the current poorly tolerated treatments to treat the dysregulation of endothelial NO production seen in a wide range of cardiovascular disorders including PAD.

DEVELOPMENTAL GENE LIS1 IN THE ADULT BRAIN IS NECESSARY FOR SPATIAL BUT NOT FOR NOVELTY MEMORY
Leighton Anne Braunstein
The Dalton School, New York, NY

The Lis1 gene, which encodes beta subunit platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH1B1), is known to play a crucial role in neuronal migration during development. Interestingly, long after neuronal migration concludes, Lis1 continues to be expressed at high levels in the adult brain. However, its role in post-migrational neurons remains unknown. To investigate the role Lis1 might play in the adult brain, four mouse mutant models that had been generated by the Cre/loxP gene targeting system were used: Lis1fl/+, Lis1fl/fl (~25% reduction in Lis1), CamKII-Cre;Lis1fl/+(~50% reduction in Cre-expressing cells), and a conditional knock out animal (Lis1cko). In this model, Lis1 is expressed throughout embryonic and early development up until post-natal day 20 (P20), at which point it is deleted from cerebral cortex layers II-IV and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Examining the morphology of adult Lis1cko mutants showed that Lis1 is necessary in adult stages for proper organization of hippocampal layers. Next, Lis1cko behavior was examined in using the novel object location and novel object preference paradigms, to test whether adult expression of Lis1 is needed for cognitive abilities, specifically spatial recognition and novelty recognition memory. These tests showed that Lis1 does not affect novelty recognition memory. Ultimately, the experiment revealed a novel role for the Lis1 gene in the adult hippocampus: the statistically significant, genotype dependent effect that Lis1 has on spatial recognition memory. This discovery could provide a target for therapeutic treatment of hippocampal-linked mental disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease.

DRINKING AND SMOKING: DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOMONITORING PROGRAM OF THE CYTOTOXIC AND GENOTOXIC EFFECTS
Carolina Ponte Rocha, Maria Frazao, Alexandra Rocha
Escola Secundaria de Lagoa, Lagoa - Azores, PORTUGAL

This project develops a program for biomonitoring the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of two substances known as enhancers of carcinogenesis: tobacco and alcohol.<br><br>As bioindicator of effect were selected 41 adults aged between 30 and 50 years, out of which 21 individuals were the exposed group, ie with heavy smoking and drinking habits and the other 20 were the control group.<br><br>Exfoliated cells of the oral epithelium were used as biomarkers of effect. This choice is due to the fact that they are the first in the digestive and breathing tracts to contact with alcohol and tobacco - two prevailing consumption habits of world population nowadays. Being so, they may be a useful screening tool for neoplasias, particularly in the oral cavity.<br><br>Two samples of epithelial cells were collected of each individual: one was used as a biomarker of cytotoxicity, in which we studied the different frequencies of nuclear anomalies - micronucleus, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis and binucleation, the other was used as a biomarker of genotoxicity through quantification of genomic DNA damaged, determinated by spectrophotometric analysis of apurinic/apyrimidinic - DNA AP sites.<br><br>Results revealed that the average amount of nuclear anomalies and the average of the DNA AP sites was higher in the exposed group than in the control group.<br><br>According to the results, we conclude that the developed biomonitoring program is a valide option in the early detection of carcinogenesis of cells that are exposed to harmful external agents, especially the epithelial cells of the oral cavity.

Nalanda College, Colombo, SRI LANKA

Over 50,000 patients were suffering from dengue fever and 211 deaths were reported during the year 2011 and 2012 in Sri Lanka. Dengue virus induces severe thrombocytopenia. People consume Ayurveda medicine together with allopathic medicine in order to increase their platelet counts. Initial survey carried out in National Hospital and Lady Ridgeway Hospital of Sri Lanka revealed that people consume boiled extracts of Cinnamomum verum (CV) and Artocarpus heterophyllus (AH) when there is thrombocytopenia due to dengue fever. Research was conducted to investigate the efficacy of plant extracts to increase the platelet count. Eighteen Wistar rats were allocated for the experiment and their baseline platelet counts were detected. They were divided into three groups (N=6). All the animal were given aqueous suspension (25mg/0.5ml) of Hydroxeyurea (Naprod Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd, India) extrapolated rat dosage according to their body weight. After seven days their platelet counts were detected. Group 1 was treated with boiled extract of (CV). Group 2 was given boiled extract of (AH).They were ingested (2mL/100g) aqueous plant extracts according to their body weight. Control group was fed with equal volume of distilled water. Hydroxeyurea treatment was continued for another one week together with plant extracts and platelet counts were detected. Results were analysed using Student T test. Rats ingested aqueous extract of Cinnamomum verum and Artocarpus heterophyllus showed significantly high platelet count compared to control. Significance was (p=0.003513) and (p =0.030618) respectively. Both extracts has the ability to increase chemically induced thrombocytopenia in Wistar rats.

THE EFFECTS OF RILUZOLE AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE ON ALS C. ELEGANS MODEL STRAIN AM725
Karalyn Nicole Pappas, Stephanie Ying
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

According to the National Institute of Health, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States. Familial cases may involve a mutation in the SOD1 gene that produces the enzyme superoxide dismutase. Another factor is monosodium glutamate, which has been shown to aggravate symptoms of ALS. Currently, Riluzole, which inhibits the release and movement of glutamate, is the only FDA approved drug for ALS. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of various treatments and time of treatment on an ALS C. elegans model. The study used strains N2, AM263 (no SOD1 mutation), and AM725 (mutated SOD1 gene). Individual solutions and combinations of monosodium glutamate (10 µM), Riluzole (50 µM), and superoxide dismutase (0.062 µM) were given to the worms starting at either Day 0 (birth) or Day 4 (diagnosis of ALS). 6 trials were completed with 5 worms on each plate (n=30), analyzing locomotion, YFP luminosity and longevity. Statistical analysis with a One Way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe Post Hoc test (p<0.05) revealed a significant increase in all tested variables with the treatment of SOD1 only on day 0. There was a temporary significant increase in locomotion with treatment of Riluzole, but a significantly lower longevity was noted. The most effective treatment was the combination of Riluzole and SOD1, where time of treatment was not significant. The data suggests that the combination treatment was effective at clearing out excess glutamate and ameliorating symptoms of ALS.

INCREASING THE ANTI-CANCEROUS PROPERTIES OF CROCUS SATIVUS EXTRACT THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF LIPOSOMAL NANOPARTICLES
John Divine Han, Jake Cui
James Madison High School, Vienna, VA

Every year, over 7.5 million people die from cancer. While current cancer treatment options such as chemotherapy or radiation treatment are effective in eliminating cancer cells, they often have detrimental side effects on the body. The purpose of this experiment was to create a novel therapeutic cancer treatment with fewer side effects. Research and experimentation was performed on Crocus sativus, specifically its extract Crocin, which proved to have a prominent ability in cancer cell inhibition. However, Crocin showed to have some harmful effects toward healthy cells as well. Also, anti-cancerous properties were exhibited only at very high concentrations. To combat these problems, Crocin was synthesized into liposomal nanoparticles. It was hypothesized that if Liposomal Crocin was applied to cell lines, there would be fewer side effects on healthy cells while higher inhibition rates were maintained on cancerous cell lines. Experimentation was performed on cancerous cell lines HeLa and H1299, and healthy cell lines 2BS and PMBC. Pure Crocin and Liposomal Crocin concentrations were applied to all cell lines. Inhibition rates were measured via morphological observation and MTT assay. Results indicated that while both Crocin and Liposomal Crocin inhibited cancer cell growth up to 80% in higher concentrations, Liposomal Crocin did so 160 times more efficiently. Liposomal Crocin inhibited 50% less healthy cells than Pure Crocin at the ideal rate of 50ug/mL. The hypothesis was supported; Liposomal Crocin was clearly able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation at a significantly higher efficiency and effectiveness while maintaining better healthy cell viability.

THE EFFECT OF BLACK TEA ON REGENERATION RATES OF DUGESIA TIGRINA
Stephanie Carolyn Gliko, Brooke Lindskog
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of black tea on the regeneration rates of Dugesia tigrina (planaria). We hypothesized that the black tea would enhance the regeneration rate of Dugesia tigrina. We prepared for our experimentation by gathering 120 medicine cups and filling each with 9 mL of spring water. We separated one planarian into each cup. We then brewed 7.4 grams of black tea in one liter of spring water at 212 degrees Fahrenheit for five minutes. For Exposure Group A, we created a serial dilution by putting one mL of tea in Concentration 1 (10%) and then taking one mL from Concentration 1 and putting it in Concentration 2, etc. After one week we bisected Group A and exposed Group B to the tea with the same serial dilution for 24 hours. After 24 hours we bisected Group B. We then bisected Group C and exposed them to the tea, using the same serial dilution. Every four days we would measure the planaria in each group. After analysis of our data, we accepted our null hypothesis, except in Concentration 1, where it had a statistically significant negative effect, causing the planaria to decrease in length. There was a change in average growth in Group A, but it was not statistically significant. Therefore, we conclude that black tea does not enhance regeneration rates.

GEL BASED ON BAUHINIA FORFICATA LEAF EXTRACT: STABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION IN DIABETIC ANIMALS SKIN HEALING WOUNDS
Walter von Sohsten Xavier Lins, Renata Colla Thosi
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Diabetes affects millions of people around the world. One of the biggest problems caused by diabetes is the difficult healing process, which in some cases causes permanent skin wounds or amputations. According to popular knowledge, Bauhinia forficata plant has anti-diabetic properties. Phytochemical studies identified a chemical marker known as Kampferol, which is found in Bauhinia forficata leaves. This may explain its hypoglycemic activity, an important pattern in commercial sample analysis. The Bauhinia forficata plant provides a hypoglycemic effect similar to insulin’s effect. Studies indicate that insulin participates in cellular and molecular reconstitution of tissues by accelerating diabetic animals skin wounds healing process. Therefore, we decided to verify the effect of a topic balm based on the extract of Bauhinia forficata when used as a skin wound treatment in diabetic animals in comparison to normal ones. Our hypothesis was that it would accelerate diabetic animals skin wounds healing due to the plant’s similarity to insulin effect. We made an extract of Bauhinia forficata. Then we formulated three topic balms based on the extract and tested their stability. The three topic balms were applied on the skin wounds treatment of non-diabetic (control group) and diabetic animals. The methodology used in this experiment demonstrated that our topic balm accelerated the healing process of both diabetic and non-diabetic animals. Some more tests will be conducted as future steps to corroborate the conclusion that it’s possible to develop a stable topic balm based on the extract of the Bauhinia forficata plant to accelerate skin wounds healing process in diabetic animals. This may be a step to diminish human patients’ skin wounds caused by diabetes.

Around Twenty thousand people die yearly worldwide because of the systemic lupus erythematousus. One of the reasons that causes this disease is the body's excessive production of IFN-BETA. The present project aims at finding a novel treatment to cure this disorder using P38 MAPK inhibitor after Lipopolysaccharide cycle on human cells and by measuring the effect of this process on producing five proteins namely: IFN-BETA, TNF-ALPHA, Cox2, Cxcl1 and IL6. The experiment passed through five steps as follows: cell culturing, total RNA preparation, Agarose electrophoresis, RNA quantification (Nanodrop), preparation of cDNA. The experiment was carried out on 18 samples divided into 3 groups: a control group, a group treated with LPS, and a group treated with LPS and the P38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580). The results obtained from this experiment show that the P38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) contributes to near elimination of IFN-BETA protein with the percentage of 96.7%. However, the P38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) effect on TNF-ALPHA, Cox2, Cxcl1 and IL6 was not as that of IFN-Beta. This leads to the conclusion that the P38 MAPK inhibitors (SB 203580) cure the excessive IFN-Beta production. As a result, the P38 MAPK inhibitors (SB 203580) can help in treating systemic lupus erythematous us and stop the suffering of many people.

Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector responsible for the transmission of dengue dissease. This mosquito is controlled by using chemicals that are harmful to the environment and humans. Moreover, it is only effective in the larvae phase of the mosquito, but not on the pupae phase. Will the extracts from leaf, seed, bark, branch bark, pulp and skin of the soursop (Annona muricata) exhibit pupicide and larvicide activity? Which will be the most effective extract on the mortality rate of the pupa and larva? The hypothesis was that extracts of the Annona muricata seeds and leaves will inhibit the development of larva and pupa of Aedes aegypti mosquito, more effectively than extracts of others parts of the plant. Ethanolic extracts were used against larvae and pupae of the dengue virus vector. The results showed that the larvae are sensitive to all extracts used producing a decrease in the viability from 83.3% to 66.7% after 24 hours. However, the pupae are resistant to most of the extracts used, but not to the pulp extract which exhibited 100% effectiveness in 4 hours of treatment. Therefore, results suggest that the extract of the soursop fruit pulp can be used as an effective strategy to fight larvae and pupae of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This is contrary to the hypothesis which indicates that the leaves and seeds would be the most effective parts.Thus this strategy is an opportunity for the development of a pesticide-based extract of soursop fruit pulp that is ecofriendly and biodegradable.

PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA: AN ANALYSIS OF DRUG THERAPY OPTIONS

BASIS Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ

Pancreatic Cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in humans (ASCO 2012). Pancreatic cancer cells exhibit a different gene expression profile from normal cells. Research is most commonly focused on inhibiting proteins over-expressed in pancreatic cancer cells to create personalized treatment (Han 2002; Lopez-Casas 2010). However, some over-expressed proteins may be biomarkers, which act as a sort of help signal released by cancer cells and which do not cause the tumor to grow (Sawyers 2008). Also, there are around 122 over-expressed proteins in Pancreatic cancer, and researchers have too many targets to focus on (Alldinger 2005). We offer a novel method to find the most important areas for future drug development, based on influential disease causing proteins in pancreatic cancer which currently lack drugs. <br><br> Our project singles out important proteins by creating a protein-protein interaction map and ranking proteins based on number of connections. We then constructed a protein-drug interaction map to analyze which influential proteins have no drugs developed for them, or have a very low drug association level. Afterward, we graphically and mathematically profiled these proteins to further determine which of these proteins is necessary for immediate research.<br><br> We found that researchers have not developed drugs able to inhibit KRAS, CDKN2A, RBBP8, or ACVR1B. According to KEGG, a KRAS mutation starts the pathway in pancreatic cancer that inhibits apoptosis in tumor cells and causes them to proliferate. By comparing KRAS’s chemical structure to similar chemical structures, of other GTPase enzymes and other proteins with Walker A motifs, we determined potential drugs that could inhibit KRAS and significantly slow the advancement of pancreatic tumors.

Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in men. In this study, we aimed to develop cheaper, effective and less harmful treatment for prostate cancer by investigating the synergistic effects of ficin obtained from fig tree latex (Ficus carica), and doxorubicin on PC-3, a well-characterized prostate cancer cell line. PNT1a, a non-tumorigenic prostate and L929, a normal fibroblast cell lines were used as controls. Ficin was purified by using HPLC and effects on proliferation were analyzed with WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Besides, scratch assay was utilized to analyze the influence on cell migration. Gene expression/miRNA microarray experiments were performed to profile the alterations both in mRNA and miRNA levels upon ficin and/or doxorubicin treatment. Ficin in combination with doxorubicin dropped cell viability without impairing normal cells, whereas doxorubicin significantly reduced the viability of normal cells. Moreover, the combination of ficin and doxorubicin reduced the migratory potential of PC-3 without altering the mobility of L929 and PNT1a. Gene expression array analysis demonstrated that combined treatment increased the expressions of apoptosis inducing factors and factors associated with cell death. As an adjuvant agent, ficin can be used in chemotherapy to decrease the dose of chemotherapeutics while increasing their power for tumorigenic cells’ inhibition and metastasis preventive effect. We propose that ficin can be used to enhance curative properties of chemotherapeutics without damaging normal cells and has a potential of being 175 times cheaper, 10 times more effective and 8 times less harmful than conventional chemotherapeutics.
