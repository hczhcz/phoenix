DIFFERENTIATION OF NEURAL PROGENITOR CELLS INTO INNER EAR HAIR CELLS: A STRATEGY FOR TREATING DEAFNESS
Sabrina Lakshmi Prabakaran
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

Inner Ear Hair Cells (IEHCs) are the sensory receptors for hearing. Damage to IEHCs due to ageing or noise pollution can result in deafness, which afflicts 33 million Americans. The human body cannot regenerate destroyed IEHCs. <br><br>The purpose of this research is to generate IEHCs in vitro using stem cell and gene therapy. IEHCs are a form of nerve cells. Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) committed to forming nerve tissue were used in this research rather than “embryonic” Neural Stem Cells, as NPCs can be obtained commercially from non-embryonic sources. <br><br>The hypothesis is that transfection, or insertion, of the pro-regulatory inner ear hair cell gene Hath1 in NPCs will upregulate genes responsible for IEHC development and prove an efficient method for the generation of IEHC. <br><br>Experiment: NPCs were cultured. The study cells were transfected with the pro-regulatory hair cell gene Hath1. Control cells were transfected with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene because it is of similar size to Hath1 but is innocuous. Five days after transfection, both cell groups were evaluated for characteristics of IEHC through gene, protein, and anatomical expression using gel electrophoresis and RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy respectively. <br><br>Results: NPC transfected with Hath1, expressed nine IEHC specific genes that, two IEHC characteristic proteins, and cilia, indicating in vitro differentiation of NPCs into IEHCs. <br><br>Applications: The ageing of America and increasing noise pollution are bound to cause an explosion of cases of sensorineural deafness. Generation of inner ear hair cells in vitro from non-embryonic NPCs is the first step towards the possibility of IEHC transplantation into the inner ear to treat deafness.<br><br>

ENTRY OF PLASMID-ENCODED TOXIN INTO THE EUKARYOTIC CELL: YEAR TWO
Kaitlin Elizabeth Burlingame
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL, USA

Plasmid-encoded toxin (PET) is produced by E. coli and is associated with persistent diarrhea especially in infants and immunodeficient patients. Traveling from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PET uses the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to move from the ER to the cytosol. Other ERAD toxins dissociate into two subunits, one of which is thermally unstable. This subunit unfolds, exposing hydrophobic residues that trigger ERAD. PET remains whole and the method it uses to trigger ERAD is unknown. This research’s purpose was to determine the mechanism PET uses to trigger ERAD and to determine PET’s interaction with ubiquitin, the marker for proteasome degradation, during its proteasomal degradation. Determining these mechanisms could lead to more successful treatment of PET and other ERAD toxins.<br><br>PET was exposed to a range of temperatures and structural measurements (circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy) were made with a spectropolarimeter. These measurements showed PET’s secondary and tertiary structures are thermally stable, indicating PET’s trigger is not thermal instability. Additionally, PET was heated to a range of temperatures and returned to physiological temperature to observe, through fluorescence spectroscopy, PET’s ability to refold. PET regained its native state confirming that PET does not use a thermal ratchet mechanism. Quenching of PET’s hydrophobic residues in the presence of acrylamide during fluorescence spectroscopy showed surface-exposed hydrophobic residues at physiological temperature, allowing PET to trigger ERAD without significant structural change. A cell detachment assay was performed using cells expressing different variations of ubiquitin to further elucidate PET’s interaction with ubiquitin.

FRIED FRUIT FLIES: THE EFFECT OF RADIATION ON DROSOPHILA
Stephanie Jean Simcox
McGregor High School, McGregor, Texas, USA

This experiment was conducted to determine if antioxidants help repair DNA damage in fruit flies that have been exposed to radiation. For this experiment, Wild-type and Cinnabar flies were used. Both were exposed to two types of media: Instant Drosophila Medium with sterile water, and Instant Drosophila Medium with a 1% solution of vitamin-E. Five larva from each vial were transferred to a petri dish and irradiated by a 254nm UV lamp for time intervals of 0, 1, 10, and 30seconds. Larva were then transferred to fresh media. Adults were counted as they emerged, and survival rates were calculated. <br><br> Survival rates for samples decreased as radiation exposure time increased.<br><br> The survival rate for Wild-type was an average of 11.67% greater than that of the Cinnabar. This could be explained because Cinnabar lack the mechanism needed to repair DNA damage caused by radiation.<br><br> The average survival rate of the flies that had been treated with vitamin-E was 25% greater than the average survival rate of the flies that had not been treated.<br><br> Based on the data collected from the experiment, it appears that by treating fly media with a 1% solution of vitamin-E the survival rate of flies that have been irradiated is increased. The increase in survival rates of the flies that were introduced to vitamin-E suggests that antioxidants do serve a role in repairing damaged DNA, however, further experimentation with a larger sample size would allow statistical tests to be performed to see if these survival rates are significant.

EFFECTS OF CIGARETTE SMOKE ON INFLAMMATORY AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES OF PHAGOCYTES AGAINST PERIODONTAL PATHOGENS
Olga Artemis Hajishengallis
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

While the physical consequences of cigarette smoke have been established, there is insufficient information on its mechanisms of toxic action at the cellular and molecular level. Therefore, this study examined the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or its nicotine constituent on the inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of phagocytes against periodontal bacteria or their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. To examine induction of cytokine release, primary neutrophils were conditioned with CSE followed by bacterial LPS challenge. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 was found to be significantly upregulated by CSE in both time periods examined (1 hr and 24 hr), while IL-6 was upregulated by CSE at 24 hr. The release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key inflammatory mediator in chronic diseases, was significantly upregulated in macrophages conditioned with CSE and stimulated with the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, compared to similarly stimulated macrophages that were not conditioned with CSE. The conditioning of macrophages with CSE resulted in reduced intracellular killing of P. gingivalis after 1.5-hr incubation, but not after longer periods (17-hr). The oxidative burst, a major antimicrobial killing mechanism in neutrophils, was measured in HL-60 neutrophils, which were conditioned with nicotine and activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Nicotine was found to significantly inhibit the oxidative burst capacity of neutrophils. These results suggest that CSE and nicotine compromise the ability of phagocytes to carry out their physiological immune and antimicrobial functions. Therefore, these mechanisms may underlie the deleterious effects of cigarette smoking in periodontitis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. <br><br>

UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATION OF THE MONOCYTE CHEMOTACTIC PROTEIN-3 (MCP-3) PROMOTER UNDER CONDITIONS SIMULATING POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) IN VITRO
Samera Akhtar-Zaidi
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, Ohio, United States

<br><br>As the leading cause of morbidity in most developed countries, cardiac disease and the study of using adult stem cells to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue after a myocardial infarction (MI) has become a crucial area of research. Previous studies have proven stem cell therapy to be beneficial on injured organs, such as the heart; this research has suggested that possible protein factors, known as chemokines, may promote regeneration to damaged myocardium post MI. They include: stromal cell derived-factor-1 (SDF-1), stem cell factor (SCF), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By increasing the density and mobilization of adult stem cells which respond to such chemokines, cardiac function can be restored. Regulation of these chemokines is a crucial part of the signaling for these specialized molecules. The area of interest in this experiment focused on the MCP-3 promoter regulation and activity under various stimuli and conditions. By expressing the promoter in adult stem cells, transcription factors would synthesize higher levels of protein through transcription.

H2A.X: A NEW FLOW CYTOMETRIC METHOD OF ANALYZING DNA DAMAGE
Carson Trawick Dance
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, Georgia, USA

As part of a study to determine the synergistic effect of different chemotherapeutic drugs on multiple myeloma in a clinical trial, it became necessary to determine the apoptotic response of cells to their given treatment. Because taking a bone marrow sample is intrusive and often difficult, being able to correlate apoptosis in myeloma cells to a surrogate marker would be a useful analytical tool. If a relationship can be seen between the H2A.X staining in surrogate tissue and annexin staining in tumor cells, it will be easier to measure a drug’s effectiveness. Because it is often difficult to get a sample large enough for immunoblotting, flow cytometry is desired for H2A.X detection.<br><br>Melphalan, a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat the cell line MM.1S, binds GGC sequences in the DNA, preventing synthesis. Using an MTT assay to measure cell proliferation, the IC-50 (point at which fifty percent of cells have died) was found in the four to ten micromolar range. Using the H2A.X monoclonal antibody, treated cells were stained and run on the flow cytometer. The data showed increasing amounts of H2A.X phosphorylation as dosage increased. Using the same concentrations, a western blot was performed looking for H2A.X and DNA-PKcs at the site of DNA damage. This test showed a high concentration of both DNA-PKcs and H2A.X. The flow assay provided evidence that H2A.X could be an acceptable method for analyzing DNA damage at early timepoints. Further investigation is needed to validate these claims. <br><br>

IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENS OR CONTAMINANTS ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Elizabeth Stephenson
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, Louisiana, USA

Contaminants that enter the environment may have an impact on the genetics of organisms. Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known model system, was used to assess the impact of possible environmental mutagens or contaminants. <br><br> The objective was to determine whether mutations would occur from potentially harmful substances. Seven conditions were tested: varying pH; aspartame; sucralose; UV radiation; UV radiation and antioxidant enriched solution; antioxidant enriched solution only; and distilled water. The Drosophila melanogaster was exposed in triplicates by mixing the solutions with their medium. The UV radiation condition was exposed for 90 min and the antioxidant-enriched condition for all generations. Other conditions were exposed for one generation of offspring. Before exposure to different conditions, three generations of random mating were carried out in order to ensure the population was homozygous for each observed trait. The experiment was continued for five generations after being subjected to different conditions. Specimens were anesthetized and observed under a microscope. Population size, mutations, and life span were recorded. T-Tests were performed using Excel and all p values < 0.05 were considered significant. <br><br> The data suggests that the pH levels 4.5 to 5.5 caused the most significant differences in population. The mutations from the artificial sweetener conditions were diluted eye pigment and one antenna. The eye mutation from the sucralose proved to be a germ line mutation. T-test showed a significantly higher life span in the use of antioxidants. <br><br> In conclusion, this study has considerable promise towards understanding novel aspects of evolutionary changes in organisms to environmental challenges.

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? THE GENETIC STUDY OF NON-SYNDROMIC UNILATERAL HEARING LOSS
Alyssa Lynn Griffin
Thibodaux High School, Thibodaux, Louisiana, United States of America

There are multiple types of hearing loss including bilateral and unilateral hearing loss. These disorders are the result of several different factors. Some of these have a genetic component while others are caused by illness or other environmental influences. This study investigated several factors and focused on the genetic causes. <br><br>To fully understand the influence of genetics, a review of genetic principles including multiple alleles, autosomal dominance, phenotypes and genotype. Sex linked genetic factors were also investigated. Several probability studies (Punnet squares) were conducted the frequency of an offspring having a genetically based hearing loss was predicted.<br><br>

A POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION BASED METHOD FOR IDENTIFICATION OF MORPHOLOGICALLY SIMILAR IMMATURE STAGES OF COTTON BOLLWORM AND TOBACCO BUDWORM
Natalie Saranga Omattage
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS, United States

Immature stages of moth species Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm) and Helicoverpa zea (bollworm/corn earworm) damage many crops, including cotton and corn. Transgenic crops effectively control budworm, but bollworm control needs insecticide sprays. Immature stages of these two species are difficult to distinguish. Correct identification of species can prevent unnecessary insecticide sprays. The goal of this project was to develop a fast and reliable method to distinguish two species. Genomic DNA from each moth species was tested with thirty inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Amplified DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis and gel photographs were examined to identify DNA fragment patterns (fingerprints). Out of the thirty primers screened (primer numbers 801-830), only nine primers (816-818 and 825-830) amplified DNA fragments from either H. virescens or H. zea. Five primers (816, 818, 827, 828, and 830) produced different fingerprints from DNA of H. virescens and H. zea. In conclusion, ISSR primers 816, 818, 827, 828, and 830 were identified as suitable for distinguishing morphologically indistinguishable stages of H. virescens and H. zea collected from infested fields. DNA sequences of differentially amplified fragments were examined to develop a simple method to identify the two moth species. Because this PCR based process is reliable and takes only a few hours to perform, field consultants can accurately identify the pest species quickly to take appropriate control action within a short time, saving money and preventing the release of harmful chemicals to the environment.

BYPASSING REPLICATIVE SENESCENCE IN PRIMARY MOUSE MAMMARY TUMOR CELLS WITH VIRAL ONCOGENES
Erin Katherine Molloy
Divine Savior Holy Angels, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America

This project attempts to overcome the first challenge of creating a cancer vaccine: to culture primary tumor cells in vitro, so they can be reintroduced to the body. Oncogenes disrupt the cell cycle in vivo, which enables cells to proliferate unchecked. By introducing the oncogenes: simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 LT), human papilloma virus 16 E6 and E7, (HPV16 E6E7), HaRas, and HaRas/Bcl2 into primary mouse mammary tumor cells, the same disruptions of the cell cycle that occur in vivo may occur in culture. Since cells that are senescing have a higher beta-galactosidase activity, I performed an assay that stains any beta-galactosidase activity blue.<br><br> In trial one, 6.3% of the cells transduced with SV40 LT and 7.8% of the cells transduced with HPV16 E6E7 experienced senescence. The nontransduced cells expereinced 11.7% senescence. While the transduced cells have a slightly reduced amount of senescence, the cells consisted of a mixed culture. Therefore, the result is not reflective of the lack of senescence in just tumor epithelial cells.<br><br> In trial two, the cells were grown in a low serum media so the fibroblasts could not survive. Contrary to the hypothesis, the cells died when transduced with SV40 LT and HPV16 E6E7. The cells that survived had been transduced with HaRas and HaRas/Bcl2. However, 100% of the cells transduced with both HaRas/Bcl2 senesced as compared to only 47.2% of the nontransduced. The tumor epithelial cells did not bypass senescence when transduced, which suggests the possibility of oncogene-induced senescence. <br><br>

BIOMOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF TRICHODERMA ISOLATES AND ANTAGONISM EFFECT ON SOIL-BORNE PATHOGENS
Rodrigo Franco Ferreira
Colegio Interativa, Londrina, Parana, BRASIL

It has been centuries since infectious diseases are responsible for attacks to plantations, especially soy. In Brazil, underground pathogens have been the cause of large losses in plantations and,enormous economic damages for farmers. The use of genetically resistant cultivars hasn't always been possible to fight these microorganisms. So, a viable alternative would be using biological control from microorganisms action which are antagonic to soil fungus. <br><br> In order to fight this problem and diminish the use of agrotoxic and pesticide, the effectiveness of Trichoderma fungus as antagonist of underground soy pathogens has been studied.<br><br> Considering the potential of Trichoderma sp. acting in the natural synthesis of antagonic composts, which can inhibit the development of other microorganisms, it's been tried to evaluate the effect of different culture rotation systems in this fungus development, hoping to identify culturea which will favor the Trichoderma development and collaborate in the soy fields sanity.<br><br> Molecular techniques, such as RAPD, for potentially being fast identifiers and fighter against pathogens, were used to evaluate genetic diversion among 25 isolations of Trichoderma obtained from different culture rotation systems. Evaluation of antagonism from the growth and sporulation in vitro of this fungues was performed together with two underground pathogens soy: Macrophomina phaseolina and Sclerotium rolfsii. <br><br> The similarity analysis showed large diversity among isolations obtained according to the culture rotation systems used. The pathogenicity proved that antagonic action from Trichoderma against pathogenic was positive. The T4, T8 and Mata treatment were soils which favored most development of Trichoderma, contributing biocontrolling actions.

GENE THERAPY OF CANCER THROUGH THE KNOCKDOWN OF THE H19 GENE
Evgeny Kiner
Ort College Givat Ram, Jerusalem, Israel

Every year cancer takes more than half a million lives in the USA alone. In order to give these people hope, my project offers a new cancer therapy based on the silencing of the H19 gene. This gene harbors oncogenic properties and is expressed in over than 30 types of cancer. It encourages angiogenesis, a process that directs blood vessels to the tumor and supplies the tumor with oxygen and nutrients once the tumor is "hungry". If this gene is silenced, the process will not happen. Thus, the tumor will not grow and expand and perhaps it will atrophy! In order to silence the gene we used a molecule called siRNA, a double stranded ribonucleic acid, which hybridizes complementarily to a target mRNA and degrades it. This is a new and pioneering technique, with which I tried to silence the H19 gene both in vitro and in vivo. <br><br> In vitro I used various techniques in molecular biology, such as cell culture, siRNA transfection, RNA extraction, RT-PCR and gel electrophoresis. The results showed that the gene is silenced when a matching siRNA penetrates the cells. Moreover, genes, that are associated with tumorigenesis showed a change in their expression as a result of H19 knockdown. During the in vivo research I found that a treatment with siRNA decreases both the volumes and the mass of tumors, which were transplanted on mice dorsa, by 50 percents. These results were very encouraging, as they showed the huge therapeutic potential of this treatment.<br><br>

My problem is how can I make the person injured in spinal cord continue his normal life? <br><br>So I start my research about: How does the brain give commands to the parts of the body? What happens when the media transporting these commands is damaged? Can we find a material that can do the same function? THE main objective of this research is to construct a bridge that can pass over the broken spinal cord, cancel it and make its function as perfect as it was done before the spinal cord is broken. to do this we need to find a material that can sense , read and conduct the electrical signals that the brain sends to the organs of the body .. Finally this material is triton X-100. This chemical substance can read, sense and conduct the electrical signals that pass through the spinal cord as it … so we can use it in the constructed bridge to allow the signals to pass and make the injured person regain his ability to continue his life and be on the track <br><br><br>

PYRIMIDINE DIMER ANALYSIS: CAFFEINE INDUCED DNA ALTERATIONS IN UV SUSCEPTIBILITY AS A POTENTIAL FOR RED TIDE CONTROL
Eric Alan Sherman
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA, USA

This research investigates the potential for exogenous caffeine to decrease photoenzymatic repair (PER) capabilities in Tetrahymena. Pyrimidine dimer content was analyzed via a UVDE FLARE Assay and population changes were measured for four caffeine concentrations (0mg/mL, 0.75mg/mL, 1mg/mL, and 1.75mg/mL) added to ciliate medium 24 hours before UV irradiation. Tetrahymena was exposed under controlled conditions to: dark control; UV-B control (12 hours UV-B and 36 hours concurrent fluorescent light); and UV-A (photoreactivating radiation [PRR]) trial (12 hours UV-B radiation followed by 12 hours UV-A radiation with 36 hours concurrent fluorescent light). Population increase after exposure to the UV-A trial supports evidence of PER and the presence of intracellular photolyase, a UV-A activated enzyme which cleaves UV-B induced pyrimidine dimers that interfere with DNA transcription. Populations exposed to 0mg/mL and 0.75mg/mL caffeine increased after exposure to PRR, providing evidence supporting PER and indicating that 0.75mg/mL caffeine is not effective at inhibiting population growth when exposed to PRR (p<.0001, p<.01). There was no significant difference (p>.1) between exposure to 1mg/mL caffeine with PRR or UV-B suggesting that caffeine inhibited PER. The UVDE FLARE Assay results support the population data for 0mg/mL, 0.75mg/mL and 1mg/mL caffeine concentrations. Populations exposed to 1.75mg/mL caffeine and PRR decreased very significantly (p<.0001) while the pyrimidine dimer count was similar to samples exposed to 1.75mg/mL caffeine and no light (p<.05), suggesting a non-dimer mediated mortality mechanism. The significance of caffeine interference with photoenzymatic repair may become increasingly important as red tide blooms (large populations of UV-tolerant G. breve) occur more frequently.

HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF A BIONANOWIRE SUBUNIT, PILA, IN E. COLI
Abigail F Groff
Conestoga Valley Senior High, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to perform the first step in generating a nanowire biosynthesis pathway: the transfection of pilA, which encodes the helical core of G. sulfurreducens’ bionanowire, into E. coli. Nanowires are tiny conductive filaments with diameters on the nanoscale (10-9m). Biosynthesis is a novel and more desirable form of nanowire production: the implications could be widespread in the nascent field of nanotechnology, particularly nanoelectrics. Primers were designed to select for pilA from the Geobacter genome, and the gene was then amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was checked via a gel electrophoresis assay before being spliced into the pCR2.1 TOPO cloning vector. E. coli was then transformed to include the recombinant vector. Cells were grown on doubly selective media and analyzed via crude PCR and a restriction digest of the isolated plasmid DNA to ensure that the correct insert was in the vector. Scanning electron micrographs of the transformants were obtained to exclude the possibility of spontaneous appendage formation. E. coli was successfully transformed to include pilA, and the inclusion of the extraneous DNA did not initiate cell death, indicating the ability of E. coli to express the gene and to accept a bionanowire assembly construct.

IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL REGULATORY MECHANISM FOR INTRACELLULAR DEGRADATION
Xin Guan
Lincoln High School, Tallahassee Florida, USA

Macroautophagy is an intracellular degradative process involving the recycling of proteins and organelles in the eukaryotic cell. Although genes responsible for autophagic induction and the wide variety of roles played by autophagy in human health and disease have been thoroughly investigated, chemical and protein factors regulating this process remain unclear. This study investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) on regulation of autophagy in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. A novel approach to measure autophagy was employed by analyzing growth of GS115, PPF1, and Atg9 autophagy strains and autophagy mutants {delta}Atg7, {delta}Atg2, and {delta}VPS15 under calorie restriction (CR [0.4% dextrose]) and rapamycin-induced stress conditions. Cell growth of mutant strains on both CR and rapamycin plates were minimal and significantly (p<0.001) lower than controls due to autophagic deficiency. Inhibition of nitric oxide was achieved by adding the NOS inhibitors l-NAME and PTIO in media. To determine the effects of NO induction, the NO donor NONOate was added. Cells inoculated on both CR and rapamycin plates with l-NAME and PTIO demonstrated a significant decrease in growth (p<0.001) in comparison to controls while addition of NONOate stimulated growth. Furthermore, the putative yeast caspase YCA1 was identified as a downstream regulator of NO-induced autophagic activation, as confirmed by a fluorimetric assay of caspase activity. These experiments may help clarify the mechanisms of autophagy in disease and the complex role of NO in stress-mediated signaling.

THE STUDY OF THE EXPANSION IN VITRO OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN CORD BLOOD
Chang Liu
Beijing No.5 High School, Beijing, China

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability of self-renewal and to differentiate into different types of blood and Lymph progenitor cells continuously; So HSCs play a critical role in the treatment of hematic diseases, and its application is gorgeous in clinic. But HSCs are too easy to differentiate while they are cultured in vitro so that it is difficult to get enough amount of cells. In order to solve this problem, we used the bionics strategy to mimic the microenvironment of bone marrow. Firstly we used cell transfection to construct an osteoblast line. Then,these osteoblast cells as a feeder layer were used to co-culture with hematopoietic stem cells as in vivo. At the same time, a conditioned medium and the 3-Dimension culture system of simulating microgravity effect were used to study the expansion in vitro of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from human cord blood. The result indicates that the system we constructed could enhance the expansion of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in vitro in a certain extent and support the ability of self-renewal and multi-differentiation of HSCs. So this co-culture system we constructed would be a potential way for clinic application of HSCs and be a useful model for exploring the mechanisms of interaction between HSCs and osteoblast cells or 3-D culture.

AQUATIC SPECIES AS MODELS FOR AGING, CANCER, AND TISSUE REGENERATION
Sohini Sircar
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School, Richmond, VA, USA

Telomeres and telomerase are critically important in human aging and cancer. The enzyme telomerase plays a crucial role in the maintenance of telomeres in immortal, germ, and tumor cells but is lacking in most human somatic cells. Interestingly, many aquatic species express telomerase in most of their tissues. Little is known about telomerase function in aquatic species, although its relationship to longevity has been suggested. The researcher hypothesized that telomerase is related to tissue regeneration and, using an experimental fish model, found increased telomerase activity, increased expression of the telomerase-associated chaperone Hsp90, and elongated telomeres during regeneration, suggesting a novel role for telomerase in aquatic species.<br><br> Last year's research project showed that the telomere lengths in fish species, specifically zebrafish and Japanese medaka, were comparable to those observed in normal human cells and that fish would serve as better vertebrate models than mice for studying telomeres and telomerase in diseases. While zfTERT cloning was partially successful, this year most of the jmTERT sequence was amplified and found to be highly homologous to TERT genes from many species, suggesting evolutionary conservation. <br><br> Collectively, the data demonstrated that aquatic animals offer a number of unique advantages for studying telomere biogenesis. Aquatic animals, particularly Japanese medaka, will become important vertebrate models for studying mechanisms of human disease, especially aging, cancer, and tissue regeneration at the organismal level.<br><br>

TLE1/GRO: A NOVEL PROTEIN INTERACTOR FOR EPHRINB1
Teddy Kamata
Frederick High School, Frederick, MD

Eph receptors and ephrins make up one of the largest families of receptor tyrosine kinases and ligands. Eph and ephrins directly bind with each other, triggering both forward- and reverse-signaling cascades. Eph-ephrin signaling controls cell-cell adhesion or repulsion that play a role in neural development, tissue patterning, and angiogenesis. Eph and ephrins have also been found to play a role in tumorigenesis. Altered levels of Eph receptors and ephrins have been observed in breast, liver, lung, and colon tumors. It is believed that the repulsive or adhesive mechanisms of Eph/ephrin interactions provide a biological basis for invasion and metastasis. Thus, understanding of the Eph-ephrin interaction is one of the keys to developing treatments for cancer.<br><br> In this study, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify candidate protein interactors for ephrinB1. The human transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1), a transcriptional corepressor, was identified. Interaction between human TLE1 and ephrinB1 was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and Western analysis. In addition to the human clone, the Xenopus TLE orthologues, amino-terminal enhancer of split (xAES), Groucho (xGro), and xTLE1 was found to interact with ephrinB1. In situ hybridization in Xenopus laevis embryos gave evidence of colocalization between Xenopus TLE orthologues and ephrinB1. Mutagenesis studies showed that the xGro/ephrinB1 binding occurs through the SP domain of xGro and the C-terminal tip of ephrinB1. EphrinB1 was coexpressed with an activated form of the fibroblast growth factor receptor known to phosphorylate ephrinB1. Upon phosphorylation of ephrinB1, the association with xGro was dramatically lost.

GENETIC CONTROL OF NIGHT VISION PHASE II: QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODULATION OF PHOTORECEPTOR DENSITY IN THE MOUSE
Congcong Guo
White Station High School, Memphis TN, USA

Night blindness is dependent on various factors, including genetics, but given the variety of factors that influence the problem, it is extremely difficult to study in human populations. Here a mouse model was used to investigate the genetic influences on the density of rods - photoreceptor cells in the retina that respond to light and detect the difference between light and dark. Rod density was measured in 38 recombinant inbred strains of mice (BXD RIs) derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J parental strains. Retinas of about 200 mice from 60 to 120 days old were mounted and rods for representative areas were counted. <br><br>The rod densities for the RI strains ranged from 391400 to 558900 rods /mm2, far above and below the parental strains, evident of transgression. To locate genes responsible for this variation, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was completed, which performs a simple regression for each of 3700 markers across the genome to find the markers most closely associated with the phenotype. A QTL region was discovered on chromosome (chr) 13, from 100 to 114 megabases (Mb), (P<0.00001) and is highly significant (p<0.01) when corrected for genome-wide testing, and contains (Map3k1) and (Il6st), both known to influence genes that play important roles in photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation. ELOVL7 and Il6st proved to be highly correlated with photoreceptor density. Finding the genetic influences of photoreceptor density could help explain important developmental mechanisms of the eye as well as normal variation in night visual acuity.

GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN PAKINSON'S DISEASE: GENES MEDIATING ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN TOXICITY IN A DROSOPHILA MODEL
Aaron Hakim
Appleby College, Oakville, Ontario, Canada

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common age-related movement disorder, affecting more than 1.8% of the population over age 65. Identification of therapies based on a molecular understanding of the disease would be of benefit to slow or stop the progression of PD. <br><br> Transgenic Drosophila that express the new A53T human alpha-synuclein gene in the brain faithfully replicate clinical & pathologic features of PD. To identify gene expression related to neurodegeneration, triplicate DNA microarrays were performed on PD-like Drosophila at three time points: pre-symptomatic, early- and advanced- disease stages. Time points were determined through testing locomotor ability (climbing response) of the PD-flies. This indicated a curve of disease progression.<br><br> Gene expression changes were seen to foreshadow neurodegeneration at the pre-symptomatic stage. Across all disease stages, the microarrays showed alteration in lipid metabolism, membrane transport and mitochondrial genes, suggesting that perturbed vesicle membrane fusion & permeability coupled with mitochondrial damage may underlie neurotoxicity in the transgenic flies. <br><br> Heat shock genes were upregulated. It was hypothesized that further enhancing these genes would be neuroprotective. The PD-like Drosophila were fed heat shock inducers Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) and Radicicol (RA) and then assayed for their locomotor ability. RA and GGA restored the locomotor ability of the PD-flies compared to controls. Thus, heat shock inducers may be a therapeutic avenue for PD. <br><br> These results are helpful in specifying disease mechanisms in PD and identifying neuroprotective therapeutic avenues. 51% of genes identified are predicted to have human homologues, indicating potential relevance for the human disease. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF WORM PROTEINS ON THE GROWTH OF HUMAN CELLS
Wendy J. Zhang
Marriotts Ridge High School, Marriottsville, MD, United States

Injured worms regenerate themselves due to their proteins. Whether the worm proteins help human cells grow has not been tested before. The hypothesis is that worm proteins dose dependently enhances human cell growth. This experiment tested the effects of earthworm proteins on the growth of HEK 293 cells, a human kidney cell line. Twelve wells were filled with 200,000 HEK 293 cells each and then divided into four groups with three wells per group. Worm protein concentrations at 0mg/ml, 0.01mg/ml, 0.1mg/ml, and 1mg/ml were put into the four groups of wells respectively. Two days later, the amounts of cells in the twelve wells were counted using a microscope. The final cell number was 387,000 ± 134,000 for 0.01mg/ml of worm proteins, a 95% growth, and 270,000 ± 61,000 for 0.1mg/ml, a 35% growth. Protein concentrations of both 0mg/ml and 1mg/ml had a final cell count of 0, with all cells dead. The 0.01mg/ml worm protein concentration was significantly (P<0.05) more effective on the growth rate of cells than 0mg/ml and 1mg/ml. There was no statistical significance between 0.1mg/ml and other concentrations. The data demonstrated that small amounts of worm protein greatly increased the growth of HEK 293 cells, therefore, suggesting an affirmative relationship between worm proteins and the growth of human cells. This experiment could lead to the making of medicines using worm proteins, in which they would help heal injuries through regenerating cells.

FORMATION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN BEAS-2B CELLS DURING IN VITRO EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT PARTICULATE MATTER
Song Qu
Monroe-Woodbury High School, Central Valley, NY, USA

Particulate matter (PM) in ambient air is a widespread environmental pollutant and has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases among urban residents. The present study aims to test the hypothesis that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be responsible for the adverse effects of PM exposure on pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. To assess ROS formation, Beas-2B cells were incubated in a Costar 96-well plate with various particles, including fine and ultrafine PM collected from ambient air. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Formation of ROS was monitored with dichlorofluorescein (DCF) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively. Compared with PBS treatment, the fluorescence intensities elevated significantly in cells incubated with H2O2, but showed no change in cells exposed to TiO2, the inert particle. Exposures to both fine and ultrafine PM also induced significant dose-dependent increases of fluorescence. On the other hand, the incubation of all tested particles did not generate any fluorescence in cells without DCF, indicating that the particles were not auto-fluorescent and, therefore, any observed fluorescence increase was ROS-related. Future studies will focus on identifying what specific forms of ROS are generated in cells incubated with PM.

A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION ON UNKNOWN VIRAL RNA SEQUENCES
Alex Kristopher Ray
South Hagerstown High School, Hagerstown, Maryland, USA

Over the past 25 years, several new viruses have been discovered, often by innovative molecular techniques. These include Hepatitis C Virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Many idiopathic diseases are thought to be of viral origin. By using a unique combination of molecular biology techniques, I am developing/optimizing the NRVANA (Non-specific RNA Virus Associated Nucleic Acid) assay. The procedure begins with synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA from the initial viral genomic RNA. Subsequently, the fragments of DNA used to initiate this, the primers, are degraded by DNA specific enzymes known as exonucleases. The cDNA is then circularized and run through a procedure known as Rolling Circle Amplification, which amplifies DNA to increase resulting copy number. This is then copied using Polymerase Chain Reaction which increases copy number exponentially. Final amplified nucleic acid fragments are cloned and sequenced. The resulting information is then compared to sequences in the GenBank database. This assay will be used to identify unknown and/or novel viral RNA sequences in plasma samples. It may also be used for preliminary diagnosis of undetectable levels of known viruses. Furthermore, it can detect viruses regardless of existing mutations within the genome, unlike most commercial assays. It will provide the capability to clone and sequence unknown viral nucleic acid sequences from clinical patients with unusual diseases of potentially viral origin. I present data using HIV-1 cell culture supernatant to demonstrate the assay’s functionality.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE M46 GENE IN THE WU24 STRAIN OF HISTOPLASMA CAPSULATUM
Hana Kamal Ali
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi

Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus and the etiological agent of histoplasmosis, a respiratory fungal infection known to plague 500,000 people in the United States annually. Histoplasma capsulatum exists in the soil (or in the laboratory at 25oC) as multicellular mold particles that, when inhaled, de-differentiate into simple, budding yeast cells in the lungs (37oC). Scientists have proposed that histoplasmosis can be prevented by stopping the mold-to-yeast shift, but the actual explanation for the transformation is still unknown. This study analyzes the expression of the M46 gene in two strains of Histoplasma capsulatum: Downs and the newly isolated, WU24. The new strain belongs to the North American 1 class along with the Downs strain, which is hypovirulent. A current problem is that the Downs strain is quickly becoming exhausted (an increase in mutations) as a result of continual growth in an artificial environment. If the WU24 strain is found to be similar to Downs, it can be used as a more reliable alternative in future research. Thus far, this is the only comparative study between Downs and the new WU24 that has been conducted. This study is divided into four areas: (A) a bioinformatics comparison revealed significant genetic similarities between Downs and WU24. (B) Radio-labeled probing was used to determine the expression of the M46 gene in Downs and WU24. (C) The M46 gene’s promoter functionality was confirmed in both strains using constructed reporter vectors equipped with green fluorescent proteins. (D) And finally, localization analyses are underway to determine the location of the M46 gene in the cell.

SEX CHROMOSOME DETERMINATION OF AMARANTHUS TUBERCULATUS USING COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION

The weed, Amaranthus tuberculatus has a lot of features which are of great interest to the weed science community. A. tuberculatus possesses many characteristics which make it a problem weed. The purpose of this project was to build a foundation for further study by determining the chromosome responsible for sex determination. The male to female ratio was also investigated to confirm a 1:1 ratio.<br><br> The chromosome in A. tuberculatus which determines sex is unknown; the mechanism is thought to be XY. This project investigated the chromosome responsible utilizing comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).<br><br> Plants were obtained from a seed bank and planted in the greenhouse. Root tips were harvested and prepared for chromosomal analysis. Chromosomal squashes were performed on root tips in preparation for hybridization. Genomic DNA from male and female plants was extracted. A nick translation was performed to label the DNA for hybridization. The hybridization was performed and fluorochromes were added in preparation for fluorescence microscopy. Male and female plants were sexed for the male to female ratio when the plants were mature.<br><br> The hybridizations were not conclusive. This is most likely due to degradation by the formamide washes. The temperature and concentration will be varied in the future. The male and female probe sequences are very similar and may also be interfering with each other. It may also be that the sex determining sequence is only a gene in length. A larger sample size is required to confirm a 1:1 ratio; however evidence suggests a different ratio.<br><br>

THROMBOSPONDIN-1 SWITCHES NITRIC OXIDE FUNCTION FROM INHIBITORY TO STIMULATORY FOR GENE EXPRESSION OF HUMAN TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL CELL MARKERS
Dayan Li
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt Maryland, USA

Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from existing blood vessels, is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is one of the most powerful angiogenesis inhibitors and interacts with nitric oxide (NO), which can inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis. TSP1-NO interaction regulates the expression of several tumor marker genes, namely four matrix genes, collagens Ialpha1, Ialpha2, IIIalpha1, and TEM8, and three basement membrane protein genes, collagen IValpha1, laminin-alpha3, and laminin-alpha4. This study developed a quantitative RT-PCR with high specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision to simultaneously monitor the expression of such genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Compared to the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, all four matrix genes and laminin-alpha3 were under-expressed, while collagen IValpha1 and laminin-alpha4 were over-expressed in normal conditions. With the exception of collagen Ialpha1, the expressions of all tumor markers were down-regulated by either 2.2nM TSP1 or 10uM DETA/NO. However, their expressions rebounded to control levels when HUVECs were treated with both TSP1 and NO. This is the first report of a TSP1-induced NO functional switch in human endothelial cells. Such finding clarifies NO’s friend-foe reputation and the contradictory tumor responses to TSP1-releasing drugs, thus prompting a re-evaluation of the drugs to make them safer and more efficient. The present study also showed for the first time that all tumor markers were differentially expressed in human endothelial cells. Quantification of differential expression for these genes can provide invaluable information on additional drug targets and their potential to be regulated in cancer treatments.

HPV = SKIN CANCER ? INVESTIGATING A LINK BETWEEN HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
Katherine Hope Morganti
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana USA

This project is an investigation of the possible existence of a link between HPV (human papillomavirus) and skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma or SCC). The motivation behind the research is the June 2006 FDA approval of the first vaccine developed to protect women against cervical cancer. The vaccine, which works by building immunity against the sexually transmitted HPV, was found to be effective in preventing almost three-quarters of all cervical cancers. This project aims to establish a link between HPV and SCC to bolster the case for broader research, in hopes of developing a vaccine to aide in the prevention of skin cancer.<br><br> <br><br>Tissue samples of SCC were prepared for microscopic examination, using established laboratory procedures. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed on each one. The staining provided a means of determining the presence of HPV.<br><br> <br><br>Ten samples of SCC were used in making two slides each, one experimental slide that was incubated with an anti-HPV rabbit antibody (BPV-1) and one negative control slide with no antibodies. These slides were compared to one HPV positive control slide, in an effort to observe any presence of HPV in the samples of SCC. <br><br> <br><br>Of the ten samples of SCC that were stained and examined, one showed a definite presence of HPV. Therefore, the research hypothesis – that HPV will be present in some squamous cell carcinoma samples, proving HPV’s oncogenic properties – is accepted.

EFFECTS OF FREEZING AND THAWING TIMES ON CELL RUPTURE
Ellen Marie Boerger
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills Kentucky, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether freezing and thawing times affect the amount of cell rupture that occurs in sugar beets. Samples of beets were placed in plastic bottles containing distilled water. To test the effect of time taken to freeze, control samples and insulated samples were placed in a dry ice/ alcohol bath. Temperatures were monitored with probes interfaced to a computer. Control samples typically reached the freezing point after about 10 minutes and took about 40 minutes to freeze, while insulated samples started to freeze in about 50 minutes and took about 100 minutes to freeze. Spectrophotometric readings averaged to 54% transmittance for the control and 76% and 86% for the two types of insulation. This indicates that there was far less cell rupture with longer times taken to freeze. To study the effects of duration of freezing and of thawing conditions, samples were placed in a –12 ∞C freezer for various lengths of time and either cooled slowly in a 4 ∞C refrigerator or more rapidly at room temperature. Freezing times of 6, 24, and 48 hours and thawing at 4 ∞C showed increasing cell rupture (52.4% to 33.0% transmittance). There was not a statistical difference in cell rupture for the rapid vs. slow thaw. <br><br>

SUSPENDED ANIMATION: ELUCIDATING THE ANOXIA RESPONSE PATHWAY
James R Valcourt
Wachusett Regional High School, Holden, MA, USA

Anoxia-related pathologies like heart attack and stroke are a leading cause of death. This project studied the mechanisms of anoxia response in Drosophila melanogaster to determine the genes involved in the anoxia response pathway. First, hatch rates of mutant embryos after anoxia treatment were examined. Then, the success of developmental arrest in anoxic embryos was studied.<br><br>The first experiments explored effects of mutations in white (w), Punch (Pu), brown (bw), and scarlet (st) genes on hatch rates after a 24-hour anoxia exposure. Embryos were placed in degassed H2O, to provoke suspended animation in response to a lack of oxygen. After removal from anoxia, it was found that w[1118], w[a], bw[1], and bw[1];st[1] mutants had a much larger reduction in hatch rates than wild-type, st[1], Pu[r1], or Pu[2]/(TM6B) mutants.<br><br>Additional experiments used methanol fixation and in situ hybridization to observe embryonic stages before and after anoxia treatment to assay the success of developmental arrest in selected mutants. Expression of the transient developmental marker runt was assayed using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes in a TSA amplification protocol. Four-hour old embryos were either fixed immediately or kept in anoxia for 24 hours before fixation, and the distribution of embryo stages was observed in each group. It was found that both wild-type and w[1118] mutants successfully arrested development in anoxia.<br><br>These results identify a novel portion of the anoxia response pathway, which is involved in reanimation after suspended animation. This research could be useful in developing therapies for heart attack and stroke.<br><br>

ASPIRIN INHIBITS COX-2 GENE EXPRESSION IN MACROPHAGE CELLS
Anartya Mandal
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA, USA

The purpose of this study is to understand the molecular mechanism of action of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), widely used as a pain reliever. Aspirin is known to inhibit the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) by irreversibly inactivating the catalytic activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COXs) through acetylation of the serine amino acid at their catalytic site. Between two isoforms of cyclooxygenases, the COX-1 isoform is constitutively expressed in most tissues and maintains housekeeping functions, while the COX-2 isoform is inducible and pro-inflammatory mostly detectable at the site of inflammation and in some forms of tumors. <br><br>Since aspirin can potentially acetylate accessible serine residue of any protein, it was hypothesized that aspirin can affect the expression of COX-2 gene. To test the hypothesis, macrophage cells were chosen as an in vitro cellular model system because they produce pro-inflammatory PGs. <br><br>Mouse macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) were treated with varying concentrations of aspirin in presence of COX-2 inducer, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 hours. Then the induced COX-2 mRNA level was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) method. The results of QRT-PCR experiment suggest that in this cell type, aspirin inhibits LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA expression. Therefore, the action of aspirin may be the result of inhibition of both COX-2 activity and COX-2 expression. <br><br>Further studies, on the effect of aspirin on the regulatory pathways and transcription factors that control COX-2 gene expression, will shed more light on the mechanism of how it prevents tumors and heart disease. <br><br>

COMPUTATIONAL EXPLORATION OF PROTEIN FUNCTIONS
Jane Ykovlevna Fomina
Westfield High School, Westfield MA, USA

The chief objective in conducting the “Computational Exploration of Protein Functions” experiment is to determine the functions of proteins purely through computer analysis of amino acid and mRNA sequences. The Myoglobin and Cytochrome C proteins are tested to decide if it is possible to use only computer database analysis to arrive at the same protein functions as laboratory testing. <br><br> Since the conserved domains remain unchanged throughout evolution, the BLAST database is used to find closely resembling proteins in other species. Accessing the multiple sequence alignment program, allows for comparing the sequences of the chosen protein to the sequences of distantly related species. With the sequences aligned by their most similar regions, the identical domains are found and the PROSITE database is used to identify each domain. The unification of all the individual domains results in the overall function of the protein. <br><br> The testing of proteins Cytochrome C and Myoglobin accurately prove the hypothesis that database information can be sufficiently used to determine the function of proteins. Equally important is the experiment’s second conclusion that the two previously unknown mRNA domains VWFC and EGF are responsible for angiogenesis and reduction reactions within the body. Further analysis of data also confirms that the amino acid sequences provide a greater range of related species while the mRNA sequences provide longer series and therefore a greater possibility of domain identification. It is the way in which this experiment unifies and analyzes unrelated database information that shows advancement in molecular science research.

TARGETING TRAF PROTEINS AS AN ANTI-TUMOR STRATEGY
Yi Cai
duPont Manual HS, Louisville and Kentucky, United States

The main causes of cancer-related deaths are tumor migration to and growth at secondary sites. To proliferate and spread, cancer cells express many secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Better understanding of mechanisms involved in the production of these proteins will be useful in developing new cancer treatments. This study examined the roles of TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) in proliferation of Lewis lung carcinoma cells (3LLC), as well as 3LLC production of proteins that play important roles in tumor proliferation and spread. Cell proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation, and protein secretion was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<br><br> TRAFs act as adapter proteins for a number of receptors, including CD40, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 3LLC express CD40, as well as its ligand, CD154. The results of our study indicate that the CD40-CD154 interaction is involved in the proliferation of 3LLC and in the production of pro-tumor proteins. We demonstrated that cell-permeable TRAF blocking peptides (TRAFBPs) can act as effective inhibitors of 3LLC proliferation and pro-tumor proteins’ synthesis. Therefore, TRAFs can affect multiple pathways that contribute to cancer growth and metastasis and, thus, may be good targets for cancer therapy.<br><br>

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF E. COLI NITRATE REDUCTASE GENE EXPRESSION
Ashley Yi-Harn Chou
Saratoga High School, Saratoga, CA, USA 

E. Coli reverts to a process known as nitrate reduction in the absence of oxygen, performed by the enzyme Nitrate Reductase. My purpose was to identify which domain (narX, narL, narQ, narP, or the fnr protein) of the Nitrate Reductase gene’s signal transduction pathway had the highest importance in regards to gene expression efficiency. The proposed hypothesis was that narX’s absence would hinder transcription the most, due to its function as a sensor on the cell’s surface. <br><br>To test this, mutants with null alleles of the domains were grown in culture mediums and put under three environmental conditions: aerobic, anaerobic and anaerobic with nitrate. The cultures were put into incubators pertaining to their specified conditions, until their cells reached mid-exponential stage, where they were then centrifuged, re-suspended in working buffer, and permeabilized. A Beta-Galactosidase Assay was then performed upon the mutants. After addition of ONPG, the specimen’s optical densities were measured with a spectrophotometer, allowing me to determine each culture's enzyme specific activity.<br><br>Results showed null alleles of narQ and narP in an anaerobic, nitrate abundant environment had specific activities similar to a wild type strain—meaning narQ and narP had little functional importance. Though the strain with a null narX protein proved to emit very low activity, the amounts in null alleles strains of narL and fnr were even less. It led to the conclusion that narX was an essential protein in Nitrate Reductase gene expression, but the fnr protein had a higher influence over the system. <br><br>

THE ROLE OF BDNF IN EARLY ACTIVITY OF PUTATIVE STEM CELLS OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS
Xiaoli Mi
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA, U.S.

In the adult brain, neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and consists of cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation. These cells later incorporate and contribute to hippocampus functions. The purpose of my project is to determine whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that regulates development and plasticity, affects early activity of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. Calcium responsive element binding protein (CREB) activity is a sign of neuronal function. To examine whether BDNF mediates the ability of new cells to show early activity, the intensity of phosphorylated-CREB expression was quantified on brains of wild-type and mutant mice, which lacked postnatal BDNF. Western analysis on NMDA receptors, an important mediator of CREB function, was also performed in the hippocampus of wild-type and mutant mice to see whether any differences in activity depended on NMDA receptor content. The results show that most 5-day old cells contain pCREB, which suggests that newly generated cells may be active by five days. However, analysis of pCREB level in the subgranular zone of wild type and mutant mice revealed no differences. In addition, the loss of BDNF did not alter NMDA receptor content in mutants. In conclusion, BDNF does not seem to be required for new neurons to activate CREB. Studying later stages of new neuronal development may lead to alternate mechanisms whereby BNDF regulates activity. These findings will be important as neurogenesis plays critical role in learning and memory and stress-related diseases such as depression and anxiety.

CANCER: WHAT CAN GARLIC DO FOR YOU?
Karthik Venkatanag Prasad
Bellaire High School, Bellaire, TX, USA

Every 9 minutes, one person dies from colon cancer: an astonishing statistic that culminates in over 50,000 people dying each year from the disease that is the second leading cause of death among cancers behind lung cancer. The main purpose of this project was to evaluate fresh garlic extract and its effect on colon cancer growth and cell cycle. It was hypothesized that fresh garlic would indeed decrease growth and arrest the cell cycle and required proteins at the G1 checkpoint.<br><br> The project was approached with two distinct experiments. The first experiment was to determine the effect of fresh garlic extract on colon cancer in a time course manner. After various doses of garlic were tested with an MTT assay, every dose of garlic inhibited the growth of the cancer cells in a dose and time dependent manner. <br><br> The second experiment was to determine the effect of fresh garlic on colon cancer’s cell cycle. After using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and Western Blotting, it was concluded that the main phase arrested was the G2 phase and that the expressions of required proteins CDC2 and p21 were decreased. This confirmed garlic’s ability to arrest cancer cells at the G2 checkpoint. <br><br> The conclusions of this project are that garlic’s anti-cancer effect can be seen through growth inhibition, G2 cell cycle arrest, and decreases in CDC2 and P21 protein expressions. Garlic could be used as a viable alternative anti-cancer agent and increased insight into the mechanisms and possible cures for all cancers.<br><br>

SNPS AND NIPS: LACTASE GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS
Keora Flanary-Olayvar
Kamehameha High School-Kapalama, Honolulu, HI, United States

The objective of this research was to compare the C/T polymorphism within the lactase gene enhancer region with lactose intolerance in various ethnic groups, primarily European vs Asian. This was achieved by gathering buccal cell DNA from adult volunteers of different ethnicities. DNA isolated form these samples was then run in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a sequence 13,910 base pairs upstream from the human lactase gene that functions as the enhancer for this gene. The amplified DNA was then cut with the enzyme HinF1, which recognizes a 5bp sequence within the enhancer that is known to contain a C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that affects the methylation and function of the enhancer. In addition, the effect of different sources of dietary lactose on the enzymatic activity of lactase was determined. The SNP correlated with both the phenotypic (tolerant vs intolerant) and genotypic (C or T) data. The data showed that majority of the population gathered was lactose intolerant because of Asian descent. Lactose digestion by lactase was determined to be most effective when whole milk was used as the lactose source and least effective with skim milk suggesting that the percentage of milk fat affects lactase activity. Thus the lactose source may, in part, be responsible for discordance in phenotypic and genotypic data.

DOES A PROTEIN BEHAVE SIMILARLY WHEN EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT CELL LINES?
Curtis D Jones
G. W. Carver High School, Birmingham Alabama, United States of America

In patients with Cystic FIbrosis (CF), DF508 CFTR misfolds and rarely makes it to the cell surface to provide activity as a Cl ion channel. This results in a failure to secrete fluid and electrolytes, leading to thick mucus in the airways of CF individuals. Growing cells at 27C corrects the folding problem and allows DF508 CFTR to arrive at the cell surface. The present study tested the hypothesis that temperature corrected DF508 CFTR behaves similarly irrespective of the cell type in which it is expressed. This hypothesis was examined in Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells and cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells (taken from a CF patient). The cell lines were tested with genistein and forskolin, both of which activate CFTR at the cell surface. Each cell line was grown at 27C or 37C. CFTR activation was indirectly measured in an Ussing chamber by testing short circuit current (Isc). The results establish that at 27C, forskolin caused a greater CFTR dependent Isc in FRT cells compared to CFBE cells. In conrast, at 27C genistein increased the Isc response much more robustly in CFBE cells than in FRT. The results suggest that high throughput screening (HTS) protocols for CF drug discovery and proteomic analyses conducted previously in the FRT model should be reevaluated using airway cells.

Distribute 20 cells per tube. Transfer each group into a different test tube, filling each tube with 10mL of the soil-water medium. Then, wrap one layer of five coils on test tube one.Continually increasing.Plug in apparatus. Leave the tubes exposed an extended amount of time. Measure and record the number of cells present. The “control” tube showed an average cell increase of 1.25 in Round I, 1.5 in Round II, and 2.25 in Round III cells per interval. The researcher identified a relationship; as the coils increased, the amount of cell increase was apparent also. The first tube:an average cell increase of 4 cells. The average increase in cells per time interval increased as the number of coils increased, which produced a higher level EMF. The second tube: 5.25 average cell increase. Third tube: 6.75 cell increase. Tube four: 9 cell increase. Tube five: 11.5 cell increase. Finally, tube six: 14.5 cell increase. Round II and Round III presented similar results. The data has proved to be consistent and accepts H1 because there was a definite increase in the number of cells as the level of the EMF was increased. Although, the researcher was incapable of such exposure, she can relate and compare her results of the affects of increasing levels of EMFs on unicellular green algae, Eremosphaera, with reference to higher level cells.

A STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF NIGELLA SATIVA (BLACK SEED) AND ITS MAIN CONSTITUENT, THYMOQUINONE, ON THE VIABILITY, PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION OF SCC12F EPITHELIAL CELLS.
Adam Akkad
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America

Black Seed (Nigella sativa) is known for it immune boosting, cancer inhibiting, virus preventing and bacterial killing properties all around the world. Through past experiments I have found that Nigella sativa and one of its major components, Thymoquinone, were very effective in not just inhibiting but killing several species of bacteria. For my experiment this year I wanted to find a way where I could make my findings practical. After contemplating the possibilities I figured that the best way to apply my findings was to develop a topical lotion for infected wounds. <br><br>My first step towards reaching my goal was to conduct a viability test for epithelial cells with different concentrations of Nigella sativa and Thymoquinone. Viability means in general "capacity for survival" and is more specifically used to mean a capacity for living, developing, or germinating under favorable conditions. I found that at low concentrations Nigella sativa and Thymoquinone did not hinder cell viability.<br><br>Second I tested an MTT proliferation assay to observe the proliferation of the cells. Cell Proliferation is the increase in the number of cells as a result of cell growth and cell division. MTT assay is a laboratory test and a standard colorimetric assay (an assay which measures changes in color) for measuring cellular proliferation (cell growth). It is used to determine cytotoxicity of potential medicinal agents and other toxic materials. I found that the Thymoquinone increased cell proliferation 23%, the Nigella sativa did not increase cell viability at any concentration.<br><br>Finally I used an actual wound healing assay to observe how the cells migrate in a wound. Pictures of the wound were taken initially and at 24 and 48 hours. At 24 hours there was a clear decrease in the size of the wound.<br><br>

IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MUTATIONS CAUSING AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS
Arti Vikas Virkud
Pine Crest School, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, USA

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has two categories, sporadic ALS (SALS) and familial ALS (FALS). This study investigates the penetrance of SOD1 in SALS patients as well as the mechanism of a mutation called deltaS160, a three base-pair deletion mutation found in Exon 5 of the Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein B (VAPB) gene in FALS patients. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA from transformed bacteria with the mutation. The levels of VAPB gene expression were measured to determine the affect of deltaS160. The cells with the mutation had unusual protein aggregation compared to controls. Gene expression was determined to be unaffected in FALS cells. Protein analysis noted that the detlaS160 mutation is upstream an alpha helix region that is apparent in a neuronal protein that uses VAPB as a subunit in its quaternary structure known as V-Snare, which controls calcium influx during action potential. In conclusion, penetrance of the SOD1 gene in SALS is low because less than 1% of the 200 SALS patients studied had SOD1 mutations. The deltaS160 was concluded to have a protein aggregating effect in non-neuronal cells of FALS patients that could potentially cause disruption in neuronal cells, so deltaS160 will be introduced as a diagnostic mutation for identifying FALS in patients. In a continuation project, deltaS160 will be used in a mice drug study to characterize the mutation furthermore. Other genes will now be studied for penetrance given the details of SOD1 mutations in SALS.

CDC42 INTERACTION WITH IRSP53 INDUCES FILOPODIA FORMATION, AND LOCALIZATION OF IRSP53 TO THE EDGE OF MOTILE CELLS
Du Ying Sewa, Navin Brian Ramakrishna
National Junior College, Singapore

This project investigates protein-protein interactions in the actin-cytoskeleton. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell motility during wound healing or cancer metastasis via formation of cellular protrusions like filopodia. A protein termed IRSp53 has been identified as an actin regulator. This project focuses on elucidating the roles of Cdc42, a Rho type GTPase, binding to IRSp53 and the Proline-rich motif of IRSp53, both of which are largely unknown.<br><br>Co-immunoprecipitation was used to investigate protein-protein interactions while wound healing assays were used to observe the localization of IRSp53 to the leading edge of motile cells. HeLa and fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells were used as models to investigate the effects of IRSp53 in cancer cells and wound healing respectively. Through co-immunoprecipitation, it was found that Cdc42, not Rac, binds IRSp53, but binding was abrogated when a point substitution (I267N) was introduced to the CRIB domain and also in the absence of the Proline-rich motif, suggesting overlapping function. Microscopy shows synergistic effects in terms of filopodia formation when IRSp53 was co-expressed with Cdc42, suggesting cooperative action. NIH wounding assays may suggest a possible autoinhibition of the SH3 domain of IRSp53. Analysis of the Proline-rich sequence shows that it is a putative SH3-binding motif and hence involved in any potential autoinhibition.<br><br>Co-immunoprecipitation and observed structures in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells help infer the regulatory role of the IRS-Cdc42 complex and the structural role of the Proline-rich motif, providing more information on the regulation of cell motility in both cancer cells and fibroblasts. <br><br>

THE PRODUCTION OF SHARK ANTIBODIES VIA HYBRIDOMA TECHNOLOGY
Hadeel Obeidah Masoudi, Adam Omar Shanah
Al Ma'arf Schools, Tabarboor, Amman, JORDAN

Sharks are one of the oldest living creatures on earth with one of the most developed immune systems. Shark antibodies are highly stable and small in size, about 10% of a human antibody which may allow better penetration of tissues and the ability to neutralize targets that may not be accessed by larger antibody molecules. We wanted to test whether shark serum can identify and react with some serious human pathogens. We also generated shark hybridoma to immortalize shark antibody producing cells so that we can obtain such antibodies indefinitely. To detect shark antibodies, the Balb/c mice were immunized by the qualified scientist with shark serum and the immunized mice serum was used as shark antiserum. ELISA was carried out to test the reactivity of shark antibodies with envelope glycoproteins of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). All four reactions yielded strong positive results that decreased in a dose dependence fashion. This indicates that shark antibodies have the potential to neutralize such viruses. Our second goal was to generate shark hybridoma. SP2/0-Ag 14 myeloma and shark spleen cells were mixed at a 1:10 myeloma/spleenocyte ratio and the cell fusion was performed at 37oC in 50% polyethylene glycol and complete DMEM-20/HEPES/pyruvate/HAT media. HAT media was used to prevent unfused myeloma cells from growing and allow hybridomas to grow. The resulting hybridoma is currently under development and growth is being monitered. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to test the cross-reactivity between shark serum and breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF. Results showed positive linkage.

THE EFFECTS OF DISACCHARIDE SUBSTITUTES IN VARYING CONCENTRATIONS ON THE LIFESPANS AND MORTALITY RATES OF WILD TYPE (WT), DAF-2 AND DAF-16 MUTANT C.ELEGANS
Stephanie Marie Hicks, Tara Pahwa
Keystone School, San Antonio TX, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of sucralose, saccharin, and aspartame as well as sucrose on lifespans and mortality rates of wild type and genetically modified C.elegans. The C.elegans were exposed to two concentrations of each sweetener: 0.01% and 0.001%. It was hypothesized that the sweetener with the most detrimental effects would be saccharin. Aspartame would be the second most harmful, sucralose the third, and sucrose the fourth. <br><br>Nutrient agar fortified with additional minerals – and the appropriate sweetener and concentration in experimental groups - was poured onto small Petri dishes. E.coli was added topically to each plate and served as a food source for the worms. Both mutant and wild type worms were synchronized before experimentation to ensure equal age. Synchronization called for the removal of worms from a stock plate and centrifuging them in a bleach solution followed by M9. After synchronization, the worms were moved in groups of twenty onto smaller experimental plates. The worms were counted daily and placed onto new plates every three days to prevent counting second generation worms. Experimentation concluded when all worms had expired.<br><br>The analyzed data showed that the sweetener with the most detrimental effects based on its effects on mortality rate and lifespan in both wild type and mutant C.elegans was aspartame. The second was saccharin, followed by sucrose, and, lastly, sucralose. These results disproved the hypothesis because it had been postulated that saccharin would have the most detrimental effects, followed by aspartame, sucralose, and lastly, sucrose. <br><br> <br><br>

CONSTRUCTION OF PLAGUE ANTIGEN FUSIONS AS VACCINE COMPONENTS AIMED AT BLOCKING HIV-1 TRANSMISSION AND INFECTION
Jonathan Hu, Howard Cheng
Corona del Sol High School, Tempe AZ, USA

The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus as a global pandemic in the past few decades poses a critical threat to public health, especially in developing countries. A region of the envelope protein gp41 located on the surface of HIV-1 called MPR649–684 was shown to mediate transcytosis across the epithelial barrier and initiate<br><br>infection. There have been past efforts to induce MPR649–684-specific antibodies towards the aim of blocking HIV-1 transcytosis, however, immune responses obtained is not considered to be potent enough to solely provide protection against transmission of HIV-1. Two proteins on the surface of the Yersinia pestis, F1 and V, were shown to fulfill<br><br>certain criteria that make them ideal candidates for a recombinant subunit vaccine. This project investigates the creation of potential vaccine candidates by fusing combinations of the F1 and V sub-unit antigens of Y. pestis to MPR649–684 and analyzing their<br><br>expression in E. coli. The creation of these recombinant proteins provides critical opportunities for vaccine research and could potentially be a part of a multicomponent vaccine aimed at blocking multiple stages of HIV-1 infection and transmission.

I.MA.GE IRON-DEFICIENCY MARKER GENE
Mattia Mestroni, Paolo Fabbro, Roberta Orlando
Istituto Tecnico Industriale "Arturo Malignani", Udine, Italy

The present work proposes a diagnostic method for the early identification of iron deficiency conditions in some high plants. This aim was reached by studying the effects of iron depletion at physiological, biochemical, and molecular level in a plant taken as a model for the response to the nutritional stress.<br><br>Studies have proved that in the cucumber plant the condition of iron deficiency induces a bigger activity of PEPC, to be explained with an increased gene expression. In particular it is proved that Fe-deficiency causes the induction of the genes that encode for the first (PEPC1) and the second (PEPC2) isoform of the enzyme.<br><br>Results have shown that the PEPC1 transcription changes faster than the PEPC2 and also that the first increases 5,96 folds when the second increases by 2,96.<br><br>This results confirm that the PEPC is an effective metabolic marker of the nutritional state of Fe in the plant and suggest the use of the PEPC1 gene expression analysis to check for this nutritional stress. Moreover, it is showed that PEPC1 gene is induced in cucumber roots before the appearance of visible symptoms in the plant. This characteristic will permit the diagnosis in an early stage, at the onset of the molecular response to Fe-deficiency perception by the plant.<br><br>The future aim is to apply this diagnostic method to other high plants, in particular on the vine, trying to go on with the experimentation.<br><br>

GENE KNOCKDOWN BY RNA INTERFERENCE. A STUDY ON LEUKAEMIA-ASSOCIATED GENES
Hampus Lundgren, Carl Fredrik Appel 
Katedralskolan, Lund, SWEDEN

RNA interference of gene expression could have important medical implications for cancer treatment. The purpose of this investigation was to try to inhibit the expression of a particular fusion gene, called BCR/ABL1, which has been shown to be a causative factor behind the development of a malignant hematologic disorder termed chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and a fraction of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In addition we investigated if another gene, called PIM1, which becomes up regulated upon BCR/ABL1 expression, could be silenced using RNA interference. To silence BCR/ABL1 and PIM1, we used double stranded small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) that were targeted towards the mRNAs of the two genes. The siRNAs were delivered into a leukaemic cell line (K562), expressing the BCR/ABL1-fusion-gene, using oligofectamine droplets. The effects on the protein expression levels of BCR/ABL1 and<br><br>PIM1 were measured using Western blot analysis. The results showed that the two proteins were quantitatively decreased after 24 and 48 hours, with the latter time point showing a more marked reduction (60-70 %) compared with untreated control cells. However, further control experiments revealed that a non-target siRNA also affected the expression of BCR/ABL1 and PIM1, albeit to a lesser extent. In summary, our experiments show that we were able to knockdown the expression of two leukaemia-associated genes enabling further studies, in particular of the combinatorial role of<br><br>BCR/ABL1 and PIM1 in the genesis of CML. These findings may in the future facilitate the development of improved treatment regiments in leukaemia.<br><br>

ROLE OF CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASES IN BDNF-INDUCED AMPA RECEPTOR SURFACE TRAFFICKING
Diya Dwarakanath
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Long-term Potentiation (LTP) is a leading candidate mechanism associated with learning and memory. At hippocampal synapses, LTP stimuli are known to increase the surface expression of AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic neuron. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin, is known to be involved in synaptic plasticity and LTP, but currently little is known about the mechanisms associated with BDNF's involvement, particularly how it may regulate the surface expression of AMPA receptors.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to determine the signaling transduction pathway(s) that BDNF goes through to traffic AMPA receptors. I hypothesized this pathway would involve calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKinases), particularly CaMKI. Experiments were carried out using hippocampal cultures and a combination of biochemical, molecular biology and immunofluorescence techniques. My preliminary studies indicate BDNF activates ERK and CaMKI through activation of trkB receptors, CaMKK (a CaMKI activator), and CaMKinases. I also found that BDNF-induced increases in GluR1 (AMPAR sub-unit) surface expression were suppressed by the CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609 and the MAPK inhibitor U0126. This would suggest that BDNF-induced increase in AMPA receptor surface expression requires CaMKinase and/or ERK activity.<br><br> Through this project, a better understanding can be gained about the mechanisms of BDNF in synaptic plasticity, leading, in turn, to a better understanding of diseases involving synaptic plasticity abnormalities, i.e. Alzheimer's, seizures, or epilepsy. The focus of future studies could include testing other possible BDNF signaling pathways and BDNF's effect in vivo.

This included proliferation of cytotoxic and stem cells carrying specific protein markers and the intracellular signals—cytokines.<br><br>In the experiment cell cultures were made and subjected to different magnetic influences. There were three groups, Group A had a North magnetic field, Group B had a South, and a control group had no magnetic field. Within each experimental group, the cultures were further divided into Con A stimulated and non-stimulated cells. After incubation Brdu testing was done to determine which cells had divided. The Imuno test revealed cell specificity. The Eliza test showed the quantity of different cytokines. <br><br>Based upon cell count data, the magnetic field caused an increase in the number of cells regardless of stimulation. However, cultures stimulated with Con A had insignificantly more cells than non-stimulated cultures. The Imuno showed that the magnetism caused a decrease in the number of cytotoxic cells and stem cells. This could mean something is either stressing the cells, or something is wrong with the cells internally. The Eliza test showed that magnetism completely shut down the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Ü was heightened in only the Con A stimulated condition. This means that a person showing non-specific antigen response would have increased inflammation due to a heightened presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine.

VACCINES FOR CANCER? THE EFFECT OF SIGNAL PEPTIDES ON DNA VACCINES FOR MELANOMA
Sanjay Maruthi Kishore
Radford High School, Radford, VA

The development of DNA “vaccines” for cancers of non-vital organs is an exciting breakthrough in tumor immunology. Previously, a successful vaccine for melanoma was developed by utilizing a DNA vaccine encoding a rationally mutated form of a mouse melanoma antigen (MMA) that enhanced the avidity of MHC-peptide ligands. Later trials saw the effectiveness of the vaccine rise with the addition of chimeric fusion proteins that stimulated the immune response as adjuvants. <br><br>It was noticed that a fusion vaccine construct in which the signal peptide region (first 34 amino acids) was cleaved after translation showed increased stability in vivo that could potentially enhance an immune response. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect on the stimulated T-cell immune response of deleting the signal peptide of the original, non-fused vaccine. It was hypothesized that the deletion of the signal peptide from the specific vaccine would generate a stronger immune response. <br><br>The vaccine was constructed by first amplifying the target antigen excluding the signal peptide with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The target antigen was inserted into a plasmid which was then transformed and “cloned” in E. coli. <br><br> <br><br>Results from this study suggest the removal of the signal peptide from a vaccine encoding a rationally mutated MMA may decrease the generated immune response. However, results also suggest the removal of the signal peptide from a vaccine encoding a wild-type MMA may increase the immune response dramatically in comparison to a vaccine encoding a wild-type MMA. These results suggest that either rationally mutating a wild-type MMA or removing its signal peptide may enhance a generated immune response, but both modifications may decrease immune responses.

THE EFFECTS OF SAME ON MMP EXPRESSION IN AN ETHANOL/LPS INDUCED FIBROTIC ANIMAL MODEL
Amber Rebecca Roberts
Independence Senior High, Charlotte, NC

The purpose of my experiment was to verify that SAMe played a role in reducing liver fibrosis by use of Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to identify MMP-2 mRNA expression. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is a natural substance in the body that functions as an antioxidant. SAMe is shown to be hepatotprotective and protects the effects of fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is the excessive build up of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as type I collagen that can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Matrix metalloproteinase’s (MMPs) have been shown to degrade type I collagen (MMP-13) and type IV college (MMP-2). SAMe has been shown to be hepatotprotective and the modulation of MMP expression plays a role in maintaining proper liver function. I examined the effect SAMe had on MMP-2 and MMP-13 mRNA expression in the total liver from an ethanol-lipopolysaccharide animal model. I performed 5 trials of RT-PCR in order to show that SAMe inhibits the expression of MMP-2. As a control, I used a previously harvested cDNA sample of a liver that was fed on an 8-week control diet, because these rats were known to have good liver function. doing my experiment I did not see a change in MMP-13 expression therefore MMP-2 was used and the expression was decreased. The data I gathered from the gels of the RT-PCR suggest that SAMe reduces MMP-2 mRNA expression which can be supported by the brightness of the bands in the samples I tested; thus through the use of RT-PCR there is reason to believe that SAMe plays a role in reducing liver fibrosis. My results showed that SAMe played a role in reducing liver fibrosis through the amount of MMP-2 mRNA expression.

BACKGROUND:Degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) results in blindness. The body cannot regenerate RPE. <br><br>HYPOTHESIS:Programming of adult Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) with the RPE specific gene, RPE65, will cause the HSC to differentiate into RPE cells and repair and restore visual function.<br><br>PROCEDURE: 1.A mouse model whose RPE has been ablated is used. 2.Study group received HSC with RPE65 gene.Controls received either a.HSC with LacZ gene (control gene) b.HSC with no gene (null HSC), or c.No HSC. 3.Ocular tissue was analyzed. <br><br>RESULTS: 1.Study group (RPE65 gene) <br><br>a) Light Microscopy showed a normal RPE layer. b) Electron Microscopy revealed morphologic characteristics of RPE cells. c) Immunohistochemistry showed cells with the RPE-specific protein, CRALBP, in the RPE layer. d) Electroretinogram measured normal visual function.<br><br>2. Control groups revealed absence or minimal RPE cell regeneration, absence of CRALBP, and absence of visual response on ERG.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS:<br><br>Programming HSC with the RPE specific gene forced adult HSCs to differentiate into RPE cells and restore vision as shown by their morphological and functional characteristic, supporting the hypothesis.<br><br>APPLICATIONS: 1.Cell replacement therapy using Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) raises ethical issues.This is the first time that targeted gene manipulation of adult HSCs has been reported as a source of cell replacement. This opens up possibilities of cell replacement therapy using adult stem cells for use in many disease types.<br><br>2.This protocol overcomes rejection as HSC can be harvested by a bone marrow aspirate, programmed with the gene of interest and re-injected back into the same individual, thus avoiding rejection and toxic immunosuppressive treatment.

EXON PREDICTION USING A SIMPLE NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH
Amy Tai
Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, Oklahoma City, OK

Exon prediction is an emerging field which has impacts in medicine, drug development, and law enforcement. Little research has considered simple neural networks for human exon prediction. It is anticipated that the simplicity of two-layer neural networks can greatly reduce the complexity of existing exon prediction algorithms. A data set of 496 input vectors was collected based on quantitative data collected on TATA boxes, TG-dinucleotides, CpG island qualities, poly-A tails, and codon bias. Six different two-layer neural networks were trained, using either all 496 vectors or 248 vectors, with either 3 or 5 nodes in the hidden layer. All networks had prediction accuracy greater than 55% and a false positive rate less than 20%, an improvement from previous research. Five-node networks displayed higher prediction abilities than 3-node networks, indicating no overparametrization. This establishes precedence for further investigation utilizing neural networks with a 5-node hidden layer. Moreover, a principal components analysis conducted on all 496 vectors shows that CpG islands have little effect on the existence of exons. This provides evidence supporting the lack of correlation between CpG islands and coding regions, a previously ambiguous relationship. Further research aims to perfect the proposed method by identifying more robust exon indicators.

THE EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN RESPONSE TO ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Stephanie Jean Simcox
McGregor High School, McGregor, TX

Ultraviolet radiation can cause DNA damage. Some of this damage can be repaired internally, and previous research has indicated that antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C) may help repair DNA damage caused by radiation as well. In this experiment, Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to UV-radiation in order to examine the effect of vitamin E, vitamin C, and a combination of vitamins E and C. <br><br> Wild-type and Cinnabar flies were used for this experiment, as Cinnabar flies lack the mechanism needed to repair DNA damage caused by radiation. Flies were raised in media that had been treated with a solution of vitamins and exposed to 254 nm of radiation. Upon exposure at 0, 10, and 30 seconds, lava were transferred into media that had also been treated with vitamins, and percent survival was determined seven days later. <br><br> In Wild-type and Cinnabar flies, treatment with vitamin E and vitamin C alone appeared to increase the survival rate after 10 seconds of radiation exposure, but the numbers were not statistically significant. This was also the case with Wild-type flies exposed to vitamins E and C together (p<.2). However, in cinnabar flies, treatment with both vitamins E and C showed a significant increase in survival rate (p<.05) after 10 seconds of radiation exposure. This suggests synergism between vitamins E and C. These vitamins alone did not significantly increase survival rate, but together did.

ANALYZING IMMUNE RESPONSE FOR ISLET TRANSPLANTS IN TYPE-1 DIABETICS
Madelaine Francis Taft-Ferguson
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Three million Americans suffer from type-1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that occurs when a person’s immune system kills its own islet cells. Type-1 diabetes can be cured or significantly reduced by islet transplantation; however, 88% of islet transplants fail after five years, likely due to rejection. The purpose of my study was to develop a viable, efficient assay to quantify cytokine levels that have been found to correlate with rejection of transplanted islets. <br><br>My first goal was to show that an intracellular cytometric staining (ICS) assay was a viable, more efficient alternative to ELISPOT. Results showed that ICS was superior to ELISPOT for investigating production of cytokines in allo-stimulated human cells: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF[alpha]), interferon-gamma (IFN[gamma]), and interleukin two (IL-2). My second goal was to modify a BD Bioscience ICS assay to quantify cytokines in allo-stimulated human cells. I made three successful modifications to the BD Bioscience Assay: first, I extended incubation time to develop an assay that could be performed in two separate four-hour workdays. Second, because anti-CD3 in the BD Bioscience Assay did not show the expected increase in cytokine production, I used PMA/Ionomycin as the chemical stimulant and positive control. Third, after cells had been stimulated, I extended incubation time, which showed that TNF[alpha] and IFN[gamma] peaked the same day, while IL-2 peaked later. The modified ICS assay is a first step toward improving islet transplants for type-1 diabetes.

A NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITOR REVEALS ESSENTIAL ROLES FOR GBF1 IN INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT
William Sun
Parkway Central High School, Chesterfield, MO

The Golgi apparatus plays an integral role in intracellular transport. A recently identified compound, called golgicide A (GCA), has been demonstrated to specifically inhibit protein trafficking while disrupting Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) structure. GCA was suspected to target ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a master regulator of intracellular traffic, or its activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. <br><br> Unlike cells from other mammalian species, Madin-Darby canine (MDCK) cells were found to be resistant to the effects of GCA in initial experiments. The canine Arf1 and GBF1 genes were amplified and sequenced from MDCK cells, revealing a methionine-leucine substitution in the canine GBF1. To determine whether this substitution caused the phenotypic resistance to GCA, it was introduced into the GCA-susceptible hamster GBF1 gene. Immunofluorescence experiments verified that cells transfected with the mutant, but not wild-type hamster GBF1, were indeed protected from the effects of GCA. It became apparent that GBF1 was the sole target of GCA, and assays were performed to determine GBF1’s role in intracellular transport.<br><br> Compound GCA arrested secretion of a marker protein at the endoplasmic reticulum, while intracellular transport of shiga toxin was blocked within endosomes. However, both of these effects were rescued in cells expressing the GBF1 mutant, indicating that GBF1 is involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport and its activity is required to maintain Golgi structure and function. This novel compound and the resistant GBF1 mutant will assist in future studies on intra-Golgi transport and the development of therapeutic drugs that resist bacterial pathogenesis.

THE EFFECT OF GDF-5 ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS
Nyiramugisha Kay Niyibizi
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of a growth factor, growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) toward osteoblasts (bone cells) cultured on coral. These cells were adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) meaning they were harvested from fat, and they had a potential to become bone cells under appropriate conditions. <br><br>The hypothesis was that the cells exposed to GDF-5 would grow more rapidly and differentiate faster and more effectively into osteoblasts than those without GDF-5. <br><br>The hypothesis was tested by growing two groups of ADSCs marked with green fluorescent protein (GFP) so they could fluoresce under a microscope; one group was exposed to the growth factor and one was not. The medium conditioned by the ADSCs that were transduced with an adenovirus carrying GDF-5 gene (adeno-GDF-5 virus) was added to the non transduced ADSCs to serve as the experimental group of growth factor-treated cells. <br><br>The cells were monitored daily for growth on the coral. The cells in the presence of GDF-5 attached to the scaffold and proliferated quickly. The cells with GDF-5 appeared to undergo morphological changes resembling osteoblast formation. Eleven days after the virus was added, both the experimental and control cells were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. The staining results showed that my hypothesis was correct; the cells exposed to GDF-5 showed more areas of mineral deposition. These data indicated that the cells with GDF-5 differentiated faster into osteoblasts.<br><br>This project is very useful for people in need of bone repair. In order to repair bone fractures, it is necessary to use scaffolds that allow cell attachment and growth to augment bone repair. Using coral in this experiment showed its potential as a scaffold for bone grafts. Also, GDF-5 worked well as an inducer for stem cell differentiation, showing that it can be useful for bone repair.

ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER UNDER THE EXPOSURE OF WIFI 2.4GHZ ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
Arthur Kuan
Stevenson School, Pebble Beach, CA

In my previous study, I discovered fruit flies living by electronic devices appeared to have life cycles slightly longer than fruit flies living in normal environment. Researchers are still disputing over the standardizing of the exposure time and strength signal in a measured experiment. Some studies used cell phone as an electromagnetic field (EMF) signal generator (SG), in which the frequency is 1800MHz. However, I am more interested in the study of the wide spread use of technology called Wi-Fi, wireless fidelity with a frequency of 2.4GHz. <br><br>I exposed Drosophila adults and embryos in the EMF-wave pro Chamber under a frequency of 2.4GHz, with power of 1 watt. My results were that Drosophila melanogaster’s embryonic stages exhibit protections against oxidative stress from EMF radiation via decreased SOD and GPx as the primary barrier (depleted); and induced CAT level for the secondary barrier. GR has no significant influence by the oxidative stress resulting from EMF radiation in our studies. However, at the adult stage, only SOD is depleted at the primary defense; CAT and GPx are both induced for the secondary defense system. GR also has no significant changes in our studies. I suggest that the adult stage is not as sensitive as the embryonic stage in Drosophila melanogaster ,and therefore the antioxidant—SOD serves as a barrier to protect the body by evidence of depletion; if further oxidative stress continued to occur, the induced CAT and GPx can help soothe and protect the adult. I conclude that a long-term exposure to EMF will accumulate oxidative stress within the Drosophila adults and embryos. Judging from the constant decrease in SOD levels, I referred back to my previous study, this accumulated oxidative stress caused a prolonged life cycle in Drosophila, due the EMF, a cell rest stage in the developmental process has occurred.

HIV-1 INFECTION AND ENDOTHELIAL PROGENITOR CELL DYSFUNCTION
Kelsey Suzanne Moore
Monarch High School, Louisville, CO

HIV-1 infection is now recognized to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk within HIV-1 infection are not clear. Endothelial injury without a sufficient compensatory reparative response is thought to accelerate the progression of cardiovascular disease and its clinical consequences, including death. Bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are now recognized to play a critically important role in maintaining, repairing and/or regenerating the endothelial monolayer and restoring functional activity. EPC dysregulation has been linked to vascular dysfunction, increased atherosclerotic disease risk and greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, it is currently unknown whether HIV-1-infection per se is associated with diminished EPC function. The aim of this small pilot study was to test the hypothesis that circulating EPC clonogenic and migratory capacity are reduced in HIV-1-infected treatment naïve individuals. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 7 healthy(age: 36±3 yr; BMI 25.4±0.3 kg/m2) and 7 HIV-1-infected (36±2 yr; BMI 24.7±0.8kg/m2) men. Cells with phenotypic EPC characteristics were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and EPC clonogenic (colony forming unit [CFU]assay) and migratory (Boyden chamber) capacity were determined. EPC colony-forming capacity was 96% lower in the HIV-1 compared with healthy men. In addition, EPC migration was 36% lower in the HIV-1 compared with healthy men. These very preliminary results suggest that: 1) EPC clonogenic and migratory capacity are lower in HIV-1-infected adults; and 2) EPC dysfunction may contribute to HIV-1-related cardiovascular risk.

EFFECTS OF TURMERIC EXTRACT ON IMMUNE RESPONSE
Rafid Mustafa
Carroll High School, Fort Wayne, IN

Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of turmeric extract on immune response. Cell suspensions of spleen cells from young and aged mice (obtained by the supervising adult) were made and placed in a 96 well micro-plate at 1x106 (10 to the power 6) cells/well. The spleen cells were then treated, in triplicate, with or without conconavalin A (Con-A) as a proliferation stimulant, and with and without turmeric extract in different concentrations such as, 1:1, 1:10; 1:50, and 1:100. Cells were then incubated for 48 hours. Radioactive isotope counts of cells were then obtained by the supervising adult (who added tritiated thymidine to each well, harvested the cells at 72 hours, and counted them using a scintillation counter), and the data was statistically analyzed. Spleen cells from young mice that received turmeric extracts (with and without concanavalin A) showed significant increase in immune response (p<0.05), while spleen cells from aged mice that received turmeric extracts (with and without concanavalin A) showed no significant increase in immune response. The data indicates how turmeric increases the ability of spleen cells in young mice to proliferate, in- vitro, and that these findings will lead to future research to determine the mechanisms that underlie these benefits.

THE EFFECT OF SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION ON VOLTAGE NOISE RESPONSE OF SIMPLE CELLS
Gabriel Isaac Fine
Scituate Junior-Senior High School, North Scituate, RI

The Feed Forward Model of information relay in the visual system describes the role of light orientation in vision. Computational neurobiology is a discipline that uses computer simulation to model the performance of neurons on a cellular level. Using NEURON, a computer program that models electrical properties of neurons, I created a simulation to measure voltage response in the simple cells of the V1 Visual cortex. In this study, synaptic depression, a form of plasticity know to exist in the visual system, was incorporated into a simulation of the Feed Forward Model in an attempt to explain voltage fluctuation in Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials (EPSP) in the simple cell. Synaptic Depression was expected to create significant voltage fluctuation in simple cells when stimulated by a low contrast preferred stimulus while inducing low voltage fluctuation in the simple cell when stimulated with a high contrast orthogonal oriented stimulus. A simulation was created using NEURON to measure voltage response in a neuron without synaptic depression and compare it to the voltage response of a cell modeled with synaptic depression. It was found that, synaptic depression created significant voltage fluctuation in the simple cell when stimulated by a low contrast preferred stimulus and that there was very little voltage fluctuation when the simple cell was stimulated by a high contrast orthogonal stimulus. These data indicate that when modeled synaptic depression appears to be a necessary addition to the Feed Forward Model. Further investigations are need into the effect of synaptic depression on voltage noise response in simple cells in order to declare synaptic depression a necessary addition to the Feed Forward Model.

THE ROLE OF MICRORNAS IN INNER EAR DEVELOPMENT
Elizabeth Joy Tao
Jefferson High School, Lafayette, IN

In an early stage of the development of zebrafish embryos, prosensory cells are progenitor cells that will give rise to hair cells and supporting cells. At a point in development, each prosensory cell is differentiated into either a hair cell with a stereociliary hair bundle or a support cell beneath the hair cells. Scientists have been researching the possible role that microRNA may play in this differentiation. With this understanding, science could repair or even reverse the effects of hearing damage. Morpholinos are 22-nucletide synthetic strands that can either mimic microRNAs or bind to and inhibit them. Our hypothesis is that microRNAs are responsible for the differentiation of hair and supporting cells in early inner ear development.<br><br>Zebrafish embryos were injected with three different morpholinos, as well as control and uninjected embryos. After 54 hours of development, the samples were mounted onto slides. Using a microscope the number of hair cells in the maculae and the lateral line were counted. <br><br>The results show a definite decrease in hair cell numbers with the injection of morpholinos. The morpholinos lessened both the number of hair cells in the maculae and neuromasts and also the number of neuromasts present along the lateral line. This finding indicates that morpholinos play a role in hair cell development. Further testing will include different morpholinos and testing to what extent the morpholinos affect developing hair cells.

CALCIUM SIGNALS IN RAT PANCREATIC INS-1 BETA CELLS
Marifel Raneses Barbasa
James Campbell High School, Ewa Beach, HI

The pancreas provides digestive enzymes for the small intestine and hormones that regulate blood glucose levels in the body. The two pancreatic endocrine hormones, insulin and glucagon, produced by the pancreatic islet cells, are responsible for maintaining the blood glucose levels in the body. Like all endocrine cells, insulin is a protein that binds with cells (such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue). The cells have receptor proteins in them to receive the signals from hormones such as insulin. Some receptor proteins signal to pore-forming proteins, called ion channels. These ion channels allow the entry and exit of specific ions into and out of cells.<br><br> It was hypothesized that rat pancreatic insulinoma-1 (INS-1) beta cells express two ion channels, transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin subfamily 1 (TRPA1), and that they are both in the plasma membrane of an INS-1 cell and in the membrane of its endoplasmic reticulum, functioning as both calcium influx and calcium release channels. The method used to test this hypothesis was fluorescent calcium-imaging. INS-1 cells were incubated in a calcium-sensitive dye called Fura-2 AM for 45 minutes at a time. Fura-2 changes the light it emits when calcium binds to it. A calcium-imaging set-up measured these wavelength changes. The resulting calcium concentration was displayed and saved on a computer. For TRPV1, capsaicin and anandamide, substances predicted to activate TRPV1, were used as test compounds. For TRPA1, icilin, a substance predicted to activate TRPA1, was used as a test compound. The inward and outward currents of cells were measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in order to confirm that TRPV1 and TRPA1 caused the resulting calcium signals. It was concluded that the calcium channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 are expressed in INS-1 cells and therefore may contribute to insulin secretion.

DROSOPHILA MODELS OF LEOPARD SYNDROME
Tabassum Rahman
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

LEOPARD syndrome (LS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genetilia, retardation of growth and deafness. LS exhibits phenotypic similarities with Noonan Syndrome (NS). Both are caused by missense mutations in PTPN11 which encodes the protein, SHP-2. In vitro studies in bacteria and mammalian cells of LS showed that SHP-2 has loss of function (LOF), opposite the gain of function (GOF) reported in NS. The purpose of this current experiment was to understand how opposing functions of the same gene could lead to similar clinical features. The current study is based on an in vivo model developed to investigate NS using Drosophila melanogaster. Stock populations of transgenic Drosophila containing two common LS mutations, Y279C and T468M into corkscrew (csw), were crossed with mutants containing LOF genes of interest. Phenotype observation of the resulting offspring revealed overexpression of LS CSW, Drosophila homologue of SHP-2 engendered ectopic wing veins, a GOF phenotype. Phenotype resembling those of EGFR GOF and NS GOF N308D alleles, suggest that LS alleles have similar GOF effects during development. Genetic interaction tests performed using LOF alleles of RAS or MAPK genes revealed suppression of the ectopic vein phenotype, confirming that the ectopic wing vein formation required EGFR/Ras/MAP kinase signaling negating previous in vitro studies of LS. Future studies will be directed at determining whether this is attributable to the minimal residual phosphatase activity of the LS mutants or whether they result from GOF docking effects.

LEVELS OF SRAGE IN AGE-STRESSED HEPG2 CELLS
Johanna Meehyun Lee
Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology, Hackensack, NJ

In conditions of hyperglycemia, such as diabetes mellitus, the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is accelerated. Accumulation of AGEs often results in aging of tissues and causes diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. AGEs bind to cell surface receptors called RAGE. This AGE-RAGE interaction induces a cascade of cytotoxic pathways that causes oxidative stress. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE), a truncated form of the receptor RAGE, appears to play an important part in AGE-related complications. It has been suggested that sRAGE competes with cell-bound RAGE for binding of AGEs and acts as a decoy, resulting in less binding of RAGE. In the experiment reported here, it was hypothesized that if HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells are stressed by the addition of AGEs, then levels of sRAGE will be upregulated. To investigate this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of AGEs (7.2 uM – 720 uM), and levels of sRAGE were measured using ELISA. The concentrations of AGEs used did not affect cell viability, as determined by an MTS assay. Levels of sRAGE showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) with the higher doses of 360 uM and 720 uM of AGEs, representing a 67 fold and 90 fold increase over the untreated control, respectively. sRAGE produced with 360 uM AGE was 1.68 fg/cell and with 720 uM AGE was 2.25 fg/cell. Levels of IL-6 production were also measured using ELISA, as there is a reported association between hyperglycemia and inflammatory cytokine production. It was hypothesized that increased levels of sRAGE would be accompanied by a decreased production of inflammatory cytokines with the sRAGE acting as a decoy. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference between the levels of IL-6 produced by the untreated HepG2 control and the cells in the various concentrations of AGEs. These results suggest that cells upregulate production of sRAGE as a defense mechanism against AGEs, but this mechanism of defense does not impact IL-6 production, implying an alternate cell-signaling pathway.

A NUMERICAL MODEL OF LATE-SPIKING NEURONS
Fiona Winifred Wood
North Haven High School, North Haven, CT

Normal brain function depends critically on timing and temporal encoding across a wide range of time intervals. The present study attempts to understand the role of cellular neurophysiology in temporal encoding on time scales ranging from tens of milliseconds to tens of seconds. One approach to this problem is to assume the existence of “reverberatory” circuits. But since typical “regular-spiking” (RS) neurons require only a few milliseconds to fire, a reverberatory circuit is an impractical mechanism for encoding tens of seconds of time because such a circuit would need a huge number of neurons. The recent discovery of “late-spiking” (LS) neurons suggests a potential resolution to this problem. These unusual neurons delay firing for seconds after the onset of a depolarizing stimulus. To investigate the role LS neurons may play in temporal encoding, I created a computational model of an LS neuron using the simulator NEURON. Computer simulations are necessary for solving the system of stiff, non-linear, differential equations that govern the activation and inactivation of the various membrane conductances as a function of time. My model, the first of its kind, demonstrates that the incorporation of a slowly inactivating potassium (“D-type”) current can in fact give rise to firing that is delayed by seconds from the stimulus onset. Furthermore, my model accurately reproduces the detailed firing characteristics of real LS neurons in the cerebral cortex. In future work, I will use the model to construct large-scale circuits of LS and RS neurons.

Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, NY

The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of general anesthetics, particularly barbiturates, remain widely uncertain. Barbiturates, such as pentobarbital, depress the function of the central nervous system through GABA receptors. Astrocytes are the major cell type in the brain and outnumber neurons ten-to-one in humans. For many years, astrocytes have long been neglected because they are electrically nonexcitable and were viewed as supportive cells. However, more than the normal amount of astrocytes were recently found in the brain in schizophrenics. Thus, the central role that astrocytes and neurons play in neurological health and disease make them a potential target for new clinical therapies.<br><br><br> Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is a multifunctional nucleotide that transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. Pentobarbital, a barbiturate, was found to function through an increase in extracellular ATP in astrocytes and neurons, along with C6 cells. Ketamine, a dissociate anesthetic, was shown to almost eliminate extracellular ATP from astrocytes, indicating a different mechanism of action. <br><br><br> The results show that extracellular ATP release is a critical mechanism for anesthetics. The hypothesis that the accumulation of adenosine contributes to the loss of consciousness in Barbiturates is validated. Astrocytic ATP release, which has been found to be a significant mediator of sedation and anesthesia, could change the outlook on schizophrenia, epilepsy, and other neurological diseases.

COMBATING MUSCLE ATROPHY: A NOVEL STUDY OF MYOFIBRIL TURNOVER IN STERNOPYGUS MACRURUS
Harrison Phu Nguyen
Detroit Catholic Central High School, Novi, MI

Muscle atrophy, the general term for any loss in skeletal muscle mass, is a debilitating response to starvation and many systemic diseases including diabetes, cancer, and renal failure. In recent years, much research has focused on identifying the molecules involved in muscle atrophy as well as elucidating the pathway that induces muscle growth (hypertrophy). However, previously, it was not known if one process impinges on the other or if the hypertrophy pathway works dominantly to suppress the atrophy program. In this study, Sternopygus macrurus, a weakly electric fish which has a unique regenerating capability, is used for the first time as a paradigm to demonstrate a hierarchy between the signals which mediate hypertrophy and those which mediate atrophy. The IGF-1/PI3K/Akt pathway, which has been shown to induce hypertrophy, also prevents the upregulation of an atrophy-mediator, the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF-1. Furthermore, the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt pathway is shown to critically mediate the translocation of the FoxO family of transcription factors, which regulate MuRF-1 and hence the atrophy process. The study thus defines an important function of the intracellular kinase Akt; Akt is capable both of activating the hypertrophy pathway and of working to simultaneously suppress catabolic pathways and, thus, the atrophy program. Finally, it is shown for the first time that MuRF-1 is more prevalent in slow-twitch muscle fibers than in fast-twitch and is more abundant around the outside of cells, which is consistent with previous studies that have indicated MuRF-1 has both nuclear and proteosomal functions. Identifying the molecular processes involved in maintaining a partial muscle program has significant implications in understanding the plasticity of striated muscle as it relates to tissue homeostasis, evolution of novel cell types, and the process of regeneration.

DETERMINING GENE MUTATIONS CONTRIBUTING TO HYPOPHOSPHATASIA
Louise Li
Fayetteville High School, Fayetteville, AR

Mutations in the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene are found to cause hypophosphatasia, a rare and inherited bone disease that can be diagnosed in different stages in life. The objective of this study was to determine if a specific gene mutation caused hypophosphatasia in utero, a relatively new category of hypophosphatasia that is also known as the “bent but not broken” disorder.<br><br> Pre-existing DNA samples of three patients with this disorder were obtained from Shriners Hospital for Children in St. Louis, MO. The samples underwent polymerase chain reactions to amplify and copy all eleven exons, or coding regions, of the TNSALP gene and then a gel electrophoresis was performed to verify amplification. Afterwards, the DNA samples were purified and sequenced.<br><br> All the disease-causing mutations were found in the same exon of the TNSALP gene while harmless polymorphisms were found in several different exons in all the patients. For two patients, a single, dominant mutation c.1133A>T,p.Asp378Val was observed in exon 10 while a novel mutation c.1181_1182delCT, a deletion, was discovered in exon 10 in the third patient. <br><br> Although the Asp378Val mutation seems to be a common mutation contributing to hypophosphatasia in utero, further investigation is needed to confirm whether or not the novel deletion also contributes to the disease.

SEPARATING THE ROLES OF HIF-1ALPHA AND HIF-2ALPHA IN TUMORIGENESIS THROUGH THE DOWNREGULATION OF HIF-2ALPHA BY RETROVIRAL INFECTION
Winston Spencer Waters II
Elmont Memorial High School, Elmont, NY

Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau gene have been shown to lead to its inactivation, which causes renal cell carcinomas. In a normal cell, Hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) subunits are ubiquitinated by the VHL protein; however, in the absence of this protein HIF-alpha levels are unusually high, which leads to irregular cellular activity. In a cell where HIFalpha is unregulated, upregulation of HIF-responsive genes occurs. This in turn increases the probability of tumorigenesis. There are multiple forms of HIF-alpha and current research has shown that HIF-2alpha has greater tumor forming potential than HIF-1alpha. In this experiment the effects of removing HIF-2alpha in VHL inactivated cells will be examined using RNA interference as a means to reduce the concentration of HIF-2alpha subunits. This will be done in order to assess whether pVHL tumor suppressor properties become apparent in the cell in the absence of HIF-2alpha, showing that reduction of HIF-2alpha has the ability to suppress tumors relating to the VHL disorder. Assessments of cell line differentiation as well as fibronectin deposition will be used in this analysis. In addition, cellular morphology will be observed, and tumor forming potential will be measured through studies of the cell lines’ cell cycles.

FREE-RADICAL BIOMARKERS: DETECTING OXIDIZED LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN IN RELATION TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE LEVELS OF AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER PATIENTS
Sishir Mannava
Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, Oklahoma City, OK

It has been noted that the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly increased in the majority of patients with autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and traditional risk factors have not been able to fully explain why this consistency exists or why patients with Sjogren’s Syndrome (SS), an autoimmune illness that affects salivary and lacrimal glands, do not also report propensity for CVD. Recently, oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) has been linked to plaque formation and destabilization within atherosclerotic lesions that lead to artherogenesis and increased susceptibility to CVD. With this knowledge, this study was undertaken to determine whether evaluation of Ox-LDL levels in SLE and SS patients could provide a connection between the autoimmune disorders and CVD. Also, because of SLE’s propensity for being mistaken for other diseases with similar symptoms, Ox-LDL trends could serve as markers for physicians to utilize in detecting autoimmune diseases in patients. To detect the levels of Ox-LDL in SLE and SS patients, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and immunoblot tests were utilized. These methods are used to detect specific proteins in tissue samples, but the ELISA procedure tested the reaction of the samples on a plate, while the immunoblot tested the response of antibodies to Ox-LDL in gel media. To conduct the experiment, purified LDL1 was modified chemically through the use of CuSO4 to produce a form of Ox-LDL and was used as the coating antigen for Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays. Furthermore, pre-modified Ox-LDL2 was used for immunoblot tests. The sera of SLE, SS, and control patients were then run through the ELISAs and immunoblots and the specificity of antibodies contained in these sera samples for the Ox-LDL was evaluated. The data showed that overall, antibodies contained in the sera of SLE patients preferentially bound to Ox-LDL. The data obtained from the sera of SS patients and controls, however, revealed binding at a much lower level than that exhibited by SLE patients. Therefore, these levels in SLE and SS patients strongly suggested that a link may exist between CVD, SLE, and Ox-LDL.

THE ROLE OF CDC7 KINASE ACTIVITY IN IME2 PROTEIN STABILIZATION DURING MEIOSIS
Brittany Lynn Katz
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

The process of meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.c.), commonly known as baker’s yeast, is extremely similar to gametogenesis. Meiotic mistakes are frequent in humans, sometimes resulting in nonviable gametes. Demystifying this process as it occurs in yeast cells may prove promising towards discovering new ways to improve meiosis in humans and diagnosing meiosis-related infertility. The mechanisms that control transcription during meiosis are one of the mysteries of meiosis. During sporulation, yeast cells produce the transcription factor Ndt80 in order to successfully complete their meiotic divisions. Transcription of the NDT80 gene is suppressed by the Sum1 repressor until it is removed by a protein named Ime2. A protein kinase named Cdc7 may aid in NDT80 transcription by phosphorylating Ime2. In order to prove this, we must rule out the possibility that Cdc7 serves to stabilize Ime2. In this investigation, different yeast strains were observed with and without the presence of a Cdc7-inhibitor to determine whether the presence of Cdc7 stabilizes Ime2. Upon conclusion of the experiment, it was proven that the amount of stable Ime2 wasn’t affected by the presence of inactive Cdc7. This suggests Cdc7 is involved in another step of the NDT80 transcription process, possibly the phosphorylation of Ime2.

THE INFLUENCE OF GROWTH PROMOTING FACTORS ON ANTIZYME INHIBITOR TRANSCRIPTION
Igal Khay Nazar
Gimnasia Realit, Rishon le Zion

Polyamines are organic cations present in all living cells, which have an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation. It is known that high polyamine levels in cells are correlated with rapid cell proliferation and cancer. The protein Antizyme Inhibitor (AzI) is a positive regulator of polyamine homeostasis. In this study, we examined the influence of growth promoting factors (FBS, EGF, TPA), on the expression of AzI. First, by using bioinformatics techniques, a putative promoter of AzI was defined as a 1.6 kb long sequence, upstream of the coding region of the gene. Next, this sequence was cloned into PGL-3 plasmid, upstream to the reporter gene firefly luciferase. Finally, the plasmid was transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblastic cells, and those cells were stimulated with either FBS, EGF or TPA. This study provides evidence for positive effect of FBS and EGF on AzI transcription. On the other hand, no effect of TPA on the AzI 2.2 kb promoter activity was found. Examining the influence of FBS on shorter promoters of AzI (1.6 kb, 1.4 kb, 1 kb and 0.7 kb) made it possible to define a 200-long sequence that reacts to the growth signals. In this study, we have successfully defined the promoter of AzI gene. Our results further establish the link between AzI, polyamine levels and cellular growth. Additionally, they raise the intriguing possibility that the positive regulation of AzI by FBS is mediated by NF-kB transcription factor – and it would be interesting to confirm this suggestion in further studies.

THE NOVEL ROLE OF THE GLUCL-ALPHA ION CHANNEL AND DIAZEPAM-BINDING GENES IN ALCOHOL ADDICTION
Kapil Vishveshwar Ramachandran
Westwood High School, Austin, TX

Alcoholism is a global problem that, each year, consumes more than 200 million dollars and wastes thousands of lives. However, the genetic cause of addiction is still not fully understood. This study was conducted to further understand the mechanisms underlying alcohol tolerance, a primary component of addiction, and to identify genes important for producing tolerance. <br><br> To understand tolerance, Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, was used to identify genes that are important for normal alcohol responses. A novel behavioral assay, based on phototaxis, was constructed and optimized to test for ethanol tolerance in Drosophila. With this assay, mutant flies, such as those with chromosomal aberrations and excisions were screened. The result of the behavioral screening was the identification of a mutant, df-7589, that did not acquire tolerance to ethanol. This mutant has a deletion that removes nine genes, five of which are described as being related to a diazepam- binding protein family. The transcriptional responses of these five genes to ethanol were measured through RNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR. These data, together with known interactions between diazepam and ethanol, suggest that Diazepam-binding proteins are necessary for ethanol tolerance. <br><br> I then analyzed the molecular pathways through which Diazepam-binding proteins act, in order to further our understanding of tolerance and alcoholism. Using RNAi gene-knockdown assays and P-element induced mutations specific to the Diazepam-binding genes in the deficiency, I have been screening point mutants to test my hypothesis. I have recently implicated a pathway involved in ethanol responses and corresponding Diazepam-binding gene mediated activity of these responses. The gene, GluClα, encodes a Glutamate-Gated Chloride Channel, a recently discovered molecular pathway. I am now working on conclusively proving the pathways' co-involvement with Diazepam-binding proteins in modulating the effects of ethanol. In the long run, I hope to use this knowledge to find a cure for alcoholism.

DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THYMOQUINONE ON CANCEROUS AND PRECANCEROUS CELL LINES
Adam Akkad
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

Black Seed (Nigella sativa) is known for its immune boosting, cancer inhibiting, virus preventing and bacterial killing properties all around the world. Through past experiments I have found that Nigella sativa and one of its major components, Thymoquinone, were very effective in not just inhibiting but killing all kinds of species of bacteria, but also increases cellular viability and proliferation in cultured human cells. This year, I am looking at the effects of Thymoquinone on cancerous and precancerous cells.<br><br>My first step towards reaching my goal was to conduct a viability test for epithelial cells with different concentrations of Thymoquinone. I found that Thymoquinone at concentrations below 30 micromolar increased cellular viability, while at higher concentrations (up to 300 micromolar) decreased cellular viability. Propidium Iodide staining was used to further investigate the mechanism of the decreased viability at higher concentrations. This assay showed that apoptosis was occurring. It is known that Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) can stimulate signaling, including cell proliferation and apoptotic cascades. Therefore I investigated whether Thymoquinone increases ROS in cells. I found that all investigated concentrations (1 to 300 micromolar) increased cellular ROS. ROS is also known to damage DNA in cells, so I performed a Comet Assay. I found that 100 micromolar Thymoquinone damages DNA in cells. This data suggests that ROS is signaling to promote cellular proliferation at lower concentrations while inducing apoptosis at higher concentrations.

KINASE SUPPRESSOR OF RAS MODULATES MULTIPLE INFLAMMATORY MAST CELL FUNCTIONS
Mia Yang Chen
Carmel High School, Carmel, IN

The Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade and Ras-PI3-K-Akt pathways are intricately regulated and evolutionarily conserved pathway that has been implicated in multiple aspects of cell fate and specialized cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, survival and degranulation. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a scaffold protein that appears to regulate activities of Ras-Erk and Ras-PI3-K. However, it remains unclear whether KSR has impact on mast cell function(s). In the present study, utilizing a KSR deficient (-/-) murine model, we examined mast cell functions in the mice. In vivo, KSR-/- mice have significantly reduced numbers of resident mast cells in a range of organs including the peritoneum and the skin as evaluated following alcian blue staining. To evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings of these in vivo observations, bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) were generated, proliferation, survival, degranulation, and migration assays were performed. A significant reduction in SCF mediated proliferation, migration, degranulation, and an increase in apoptosis was observed in KSR-/- BMMCs as compared to that in wildtype (WT) cells. Given that Erk and Akt are established molecular targets controlling these cellular functions, we next performed western blot to assess if there is any alteration in these signaling pathways. A reduction in phosphorylation of Erk and Akt was observed in the KSR -/- BMMCs as compared to that in WT BMMCs. Collectively, our results suggest that KSR is an important regulatory kinase that may be a viable molecular target for modulating inflammatory mast cell functions.

HOW INFLAMMATION KEEPS US ALIVE: THE SUPERANTIGEN PARADOX
Nikhita Singh
A.B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

Bacterial superantigens (SAgs) are pyrogenic exotoxins that cause massive T cell activation leading to diseases such as toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever, HIV, and AIDS. Autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are also linked with SAgs. Despite the strong immunostimulatory capacity of these toxins and the high frequency of infections by superantigen-producing bacteria, superantigen-induced diseases, and toxic shock in particular, are rather uncommon. In order to explain this “paradox”, it was hypothesized SAg-expressing bacteria have been selected for strategies that down-regulate the immune response to these toxins. If correct, this would mean that the concomitant presence of SAg and bacteria would prevent toxic shock. It was found that human T cell response to staphylococcal SAg is inhibited by simultaneous presence of bacteria. This down regulation, measured as IL-2 response, resulted from the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 signaling through the NF-kB pathway by the peptidoglycan on the bacterial cell wall, leading to IL-10 production and the induction of apoptosis of antigen presenting cells. A computational model of these observations was then used to generate hypothesis regarded T cell activation. Experiments were conducted under varying conditions, with IL-2 as the readout. Hypothesis generated by the model was then tested in vitro to determine validity of model. Through further experimentation in the field, it is possible to control the harmful effects of superantigens in situations such as hospital infections, biological warfare, and disease.

EFFERENT SYNAPTIC DEVELOPMENT INFLUENCED BY TARGET SIGNALING
Omar Osama Abudayyeh
Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

The medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, serves as a simple and useful model for the anatomical investigation of neurons and their development. Heart excitor (HE) motor neurons contain the neurotransmitters acetylecholine (ACh) and FMRFamide (FMRF). Examinations of the heart tube showed that locations of FMRF synapses do not correspond to all places of HE innervation, indicating that there may be some other type of synapse being developed. This project investigated what types of synapses were being developed by using various synapse-labeling procedures. After dissecting the leeches and exposing the heart tubes, two labeling solutions were used. One solution showed ACh synapses as dense brown patches while the other solution showed FMRF synapses as red dots. If only red dots were visible then the synapses contained FMRF. If only brown patches were present, then the synapses contained ACh. Any overlap between red dots and brown patches were synapses with both neurotransmitters. It was discovered that HE neurons had the ability to form ACh-only synapses and FMRF-only synapses in addition to the already understood ACh/FMRF synapses. These results suggest that the HE neuron has the ability to form multiple types of synapses in order to perform many functions. The current model of the nervous system may need revision as presently it dictates that a neuron only does one function using a certain mixture of neurotransmitters. This remarkable discovery should help scientists better understand the intricacies of the human nervous system, enabling them to better fight such diseases as Alzheimer’s and muscular dystrophy.

DEVELOPING AN IN VITRO METHOD FOR TESTING GENES THAT REGULATE ANGIOGENESIS
Elizabeth Cai
Briarcliff Manor High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

Neoangiogenesis, the formation of new vessels, is a crucial process in cancer (tumor angiogenesis), macular degeneration and other diseases, and is the target of approved as well as under-development therapeutic regimens. In order to study the role of genes and/or pharmacological interventions implicated in neoangiogenesis, an in vitro method utilizing genetically modified Embryonic Stem (ES) cells was developed. Focusing on VegfR2 as a prototypical example, ES cell lines modified to be homozygous-null (VegfR2 LacZ/LacZ — 1432AA2), conditional null (VegfR2 LacZ/COIN; ROSA26 CreERt2/+ — 2192VB12), and wild type (VegfR2 LacZ/LacZ; ROSA26 CreERt2/COIN — 2192BH1) for VegfR2 where examined for their ability to differentiate into endothelial cells (as judged by expression of PECAM) and organize into vessels (sprouting). Critical experimental parameters – such as treatment with Tamoxifen, activation of Cre, and expression of eGFP – were shown to have no effect on the angiogenic process, effectively establishing a robust protocol for the examination of the role of different genes in angiogenesis. In this in vitro model of neoangiogenesis, VegfR2 was not required for differentiation of ES cells into endothelial cells, yet necessary for their organizing into sprouts. This mirrors results obtained with ES cell-derived tumors in vivo (Thurston et al, personal communication), stands in contrast to the apparent requirement for VegfR2 for normal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during development, and provides a possible explanation to the resistance of certain tumors to therapeutic approaches targeting the VEGF pathway.

USING LAMININ TO PROMOTE THE REVERSAL OF MYELIN INHIBITION IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM NEURONS
Daniel George Barson
John Jay High School, Cross River, NY

Central nervous system neurons do not regenerate after injury due to the presence of inhibitory proteins (Nogo, MAG, OMgp) in the neuronal oligodendrocyte myelination that interact with receptors on the neuronal growth cone signaling the collapse of the growth cone. Previous research has shown that treatment that increases the level of cAMP in the CNS growth cone will encourage regeneration by preserving growth cone structural integrity through CREB phosphorylation and arginine synthesis (Gao 2004). Many protein and chemical cascades have been investigated to determine the mechanism by which cAMP preserves the cyoteskeletal rigidity in the growth cone, and many appear to be involved. Laminin is an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule that binds to the integrin receptor on the growth cone of a neuron attempting growth. By simulating the inhibitory nature of the CNS in vitro using a neurite outgrowth assay, this study shows that treatment with laminin promotes outgrowth of CNS neurons in spite of the inhibitory environment. Further research will seek to use Western Blot analysis (SDS-PAGE) to show that laminin acts through an integrin-linked signaling cascade by which the cAMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase is inactivated, allowing for an increase in cAMP in the budding growth cone and viable growth.

CANCER CELLS CLEAVE CYCLIN E INTO LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT FORMS
Phoebe Dana Cole
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany, NY

To demonstrate that proto-oncogene cyclin E protein is cleaved into low molecular weight (LMW) form in cancer cells, two plasmids were designed; one expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Cyclin E fusion protein containing an elastase sensitive site and one expressing a GFP-Cyclin E fusion protein containing an elastase resistant site. Both fusion proteins also contained a nuclear localization signal (NLS), designed to target the fusion proteins to the nucleus of the cells. These plasmids were transfected into five tumor cell lines and imaged with light fluorescent microscope to detect GFP signal. When the plasmid containing elastase resistant form of cyclin E was transfected into cancer cells, GFP expression was strictly nuclear. I propose that GFP expression was nuclear because the GFP-cyclin E-NLS fusion protein was still intact, and the NLS targeted the fusion protein to the nucleus of the cells, therefore confirming that the cyclin E protein was not undergoing proteolytic cleavage. When the plasmid containing the elastase sensitive form of cyclin E was transfected into cancer cells, the GFP expression was detected only in the cytoplasm of the cells. This location indicates that cyclin E was proteolytically cleaved, therefore removing the NLS tag, and no longer targeting the fusion protein to the nucleus, consequently there was an accumulation of the protein in the cytoplasm. This confirms for the first time that LMW cyclin E, a protein that is strongly correlated with breast cancer and poor patient outcome, is cleaved into LMW forms inside cancer cells.

A ROLE IN HEARING MECHANOTRANSDUCTION? CHARACTERIZATION & LOCALIZATION OF LIPID-BINDING PROTEIN STARD10
Patrick David Hsu
Homeschool, Stanford, CA

The main process of hearing, mechanoelectrical transduction (MET), is dependent on mechanical properties of hair cell membranes that change with the phospholipid bilayer composition. Modification of these properties due to protein-lipid interactions in membranes may thus play a role in the MET pathway. My research characterized and localized a putative stereociliary protein - StARD10 - to understand possible contributions to auditory transduction. I hypothesize that StARD10 is localized to the hair bundle and modulates the lipid composition of stereocilia membrane due to its phospholipid binding and shuttling properties.<br><br> The mouse homologue of StARD10 was PCR-amplified from an organ of Corti cDNA library and transposed into a recombinant bacmid. Transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells produced baculovirus stock for large-scale protein expression. A high-affinity polyclonal anti-StARD10 antibody was produced in immunized rabbits for in vitro and whole-mount immunostaining studies. Lipid-binding specificity of StARD10 was also studied through antigen capture assays.<br><br> I found that StARD10 exhibits strong membrane concentration in HEK 293 cells and microvilli localization in LLC-PK1-CL4 cells. In native tissue, it localizes to hair bundles and stains the pericuticular necklace. Finally, StARD10 binds specifically to inositol phospholipids. This is the first time StarD10 has been characterized in the mouse or inner ear. <br><br> The crucial roles that phosphoinositides play in actin filament reorganization and polymerization make them key players in cellular growth and polarity. Based on my results, StARD10 may modulate PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P to affect actin development of hair bundles, associating StARD10 with stereociliary development, gradient maintenance, and mechanotransduction sensitivity. Furthermore, due to its localization in smaller hair cells, StARD10 might play a role in cochlear frequency tuning.

CHARACTERIZATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN MYXOCOCCUS XANTHUS FRUITING BODY FORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF BIOFILMS
Carrie Lee Wubben
Woden-Crystal Lake-Titonka High School, Crystal Lake, IA

Biofilms are highly organized communities of microbial cells attached to solid surfaces. Bacterial biofilms have been linked to numerous health problems in humans and are not treatable with typical antibiotic therapies. Therefore, scientists need different treatment options. In order to combat biofilms, researchers must understand the genetic and molecular basis of their formation. This can be achieved by identifying and characterizing genes that are believed to be involved in biofilm formation. My research addresses this need by characterizing new genes required for Myxococcus xanthus fruiting body development, a well-studied model system for the formation of single-species biofilms. <br><br> When deprived of nutrients, Myxococcus xanthus initiates a developmental program allowing groups of cells to migrate to aggregation centers and begin building multicellular fruiting bodies. Once a fruiting body is molded into its final shape, individual cells within this structure become dormant spores that are resistant to environmental stresses. Fruiting body development requires that cells be motile. Therefore, I focused on putative motility genes. Mutants containing plasmid insertions in these genes were monitored for fruiting body formation using phase-contrast microscopy and sporulation by comparing their sporulation efficiency to that of wild-type cells. Also, each mutant was tested for defects in motility using swarm expansion assays.<br><br> A majority of the mutations affected motility and fruiting body formation. Results from these studies can be expanded to identify genes involved in biofilm formation in bacterial pathogens. The practical application of this information is the potential discovery of new targets for biofilm disruption and other treatment possibilities.

COLD SENSATION THROUGH MENTHOL-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF TRPM8 ION CHANNELS
Angela Lingxin Qian
Glenwood High School, Chatham, IL

The activation of various transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels results in different sensory perceptions such as pain and temperature sensation. Studies have revealed that several of these channels are activated by chemicals, such as capsaicin, which activates TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channels, and menthol, which activates TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channels. However, the biological mechanisms of action for some of the channels are still unknown. This study was designed to determine the activation characteristics of TRPM8 and the differences in properties of TRPM8 and TRPV1 ion channels.<br><br>TRPM8-mediated ion channel activity was recorded from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which were cultured on glass coverslips. Using patch-clamp techniques, a giga-seal was formed between the pipette containing a menthol solution and the cell membrane of a DRG neuron. Single channel activity was observed and recorded and stored into a computer and analyzed. Analyzed TRPM8 data was then compared to previously known data for TRPV1 ion channels.<br><br>The results showed activation of TRPM8 ion channels by menthol, and provided data for the characterization of channel. It is concluded that the activation of TRPM8 ion channels by menthol produces currents, the electrical recordings of which show channel characteristics unique to TRPM8. Further studies may provide a means for the development of more effective methods of pain relief.

MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF A EUKARYOTIC CIRCADIAN CLOCK
Alexander Chi-Jan Huang
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

Circadian rhythms in biological organisms arise from cellular-level metabolic and genetic regulation. The regulation process in eukaryotes involves proteins and enzymes forming complex feedback processes to generate oscillations. Mathematical modeling of the regulation process allows a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms and functions of the rhythms. In this work, the circadian clock of fungus Neurospora crassa was studies in detail with a new mathematical model which provides a basis to understand the circadian mechanisms of other eukaryotes. The new model was established with activating-inhibiting feedback loops exerted on the expression of frq gene by proteins Frequency (FRQ) and White Collar Complex (WCC).<br><br><br><br>The model has been successfully validated with various laboratory data and it entrains to a 24-hour period under circadian light-dark cycles. It demonstrated period sensitivity to the degradation of FRQ and provided molecular-level explanations for single-pulse suppression and cessation of clock activities under constant light. The model also predicts several new phenomena not yet seen in the laboratory and is thus ideal to serve as a tool to design future experiments. The work suggests similar genetic feedback models can be developed to study the circadian behaviors of higher eukaryotes.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO NERVE REGENERATION: MST3B NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION
Xiaoli Mi
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Axon outgrowth is crucial to brain development and functional recovery of the nervous system after disease or injury. As the regenerative capacity of the nervous system is significantly limited in adults, studying the mechanisms that activate axon regeneration will be useful in developing therapies for the repair of brain circuitry. <br><br>In this study, a novel approach to nerve regeneration through Mst3b nuclear localization is identified. Mst3b is a neuron-specific and purine-sensitive kinase that regulates axon outgrowth. It exhibits a nuclear export (NES) site and a nuclear localization site (NLS) on the C terminal end of the amino acid sequence. Its mechanisms remain largely unknown and are explored in a PC12 cell line model. The region of Mst3b critical in regulating axon outgrowth is determined through transfection with wild-type Human Mst3b and Human Mst3b with C terminal deletion in PC12 cells stably transfected with shRNA against Mst3b. Mst3b cellular localization is further analyzed using immunostaining and transfection with Mst3b-EGFP in addition to various treatments of inosine, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), and nerve growth factor (NGF). <br><br>Compared to wild-type Mst3b, C terminal deletion and NES removal of Mst3b significantly increase neurite outgrowth. In addition, nuclear localization of Mst3b is found to associate with neurite regeneration. These findings could be useful in identifying targets for developing of new treatments for nervous system recovery after stroke, injury, or neurodegenerative diseases.

A NEW TARGET OF ASPIRIN: UNVEILING A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION
Anartya Mandal
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

The purpose of this study is to understand the molecular mechanism(s) of action of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), widely used in alleviating mild pain. It is a multifunctional drug as it is efficacious also in rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, colon tumor, and Alzheimer’s disease. Aspirin is known to exert its action by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COXs), enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting step of biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), a class of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. The COX-1 isoform is constitutively expressed whereas the COX-2 isoform is inducible. At the molecular level, aspirin acetylates serine 530 residue of COX-1 and serine 516 residue of COX-2, at their catalytic sites. Aspirin was also reported to inhibit Ikappa kinase-beta (IKKbeta) and Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) at higher concentrations indicating its multiple targets. <br><br>As the COX-2 gene is inducible by inflammatory stimuli, I hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of aspirin is also due to inhibition of the induction of the COX-2 gene expression.<br><br>To test the hypothesis in vitro, COX-2 protein levels were compared in aspirin-treated and untreated mouse macrophage cells (RAW 264.7), induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), employing immuno-blotting techniques. The results indicate that aspirin inhibits LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression. More interestingly, aspirin was found to do so by inhibiting LPS receptor (TLR4)-mediated activation of MEK of the TLR4/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in this cell type. <br><br>Therefore, by targeting the MEK/ERK signaling pathway aspirin might affect expression of other genes.

ANALYSIS OF OPSIN GENES FOR INSIGHT INTO THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OF COLOR VISION
Amy Belynne Dixon
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

Trichromatic vision is characteristic to humans, Old World primates, and one species of New World primate, the Howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) and is dependent upon separate X-linked opsin genes organized in a head-to-tail tandem array. These genes are flanked on the upstream side by a locus-control region which contains Alu elements. This study compared the location of Alu element sequences in the Marmoset (a dichromatic New World primate) and the Howler Monkey (the only trichromatic New World primate), as Alu sequences can be involved in gene duplication, the mechanism responsible for the development of trichromatic vision. Nucleotide sequences, obtained from the NCBI gene database, were compared with a Basic Local Alignment Sequencing Tool (BLAST). Alu element homology shared between the Howler monkey and Marmoset could underlie the opsin gene duplication observed in the Howler, and be indicative of the potential for gene duplication in other New World primate species. Protein comparisons were conducted between opsin genes within and between trichromatic species, including Old World primates and humans, using BLAST. The results demonstrate greater homology between X-linked opsin genes, including Middle-wave (MW) and Long-wave (LW), between different species of primates and less for the MW-LW identities shared in comparison within individual species, thus indicating that gene duplication occurred before species divergence in this instance. Because opsin gene duplication in the Howler monkey occurred after divergence, however, the timing of X-linked duplication could be variable in some cases.

METABOLIC IDENTIFICATION OF GLYCOLYTIC-DEPENDENT PHENOTYPES IN GL261 BRAIN TUMOR CELLS
Brandon Matravers Law
Wayzata High School, Plymouth, MN

The present study analyzed the metabolic phenotype of GL261 glioma brain tumor cells to identify active metabolic pathways in high (20%) and low (5%) oxygen conditions. The metabolic profile was determined by different metabolic substrates (sugars and amino acids) and oxygen tensions in novel metabolic phenotype technology. A microplate spectrophotometer quantified metabolic activity through absorbance measurements from formazan accumulation. GL261 glioma cells displayed significantly higher metabolic activity in assay wells with a-D-glucose or D-mannose than the blank control in high oxygen conditions (P < 0.001). Cells displayed high metabolic activity in D-mannose (P < 0.001) but low metabolic activity in a-D-glucose in low oxygen conditions. Low metabolic activity was observed in all other substrates (e.g. pyruvic acid, citric acid) in both high and low oxygen conditions. Cells in amino acids exhibited a significantly higher metabolic activity than their low oxygen counterparts (P < 0.001). These findings identify a mannose-reliant, glycolytic-dependent phenotype in GL261 glioma cells. The results from this study will provide information regarding specific metabolic pathways that are active under in vivo low oxygen conditions that could be targeted with subsequent development of tumor cell-specific metabolic inhibitors.

DIETARY INTERVENTION OF FLAX SEED/OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS IN OVARIAN CANCER IN THE LAYING HEN, GALLUS DOMESTICUS
Shailee Samir Shah
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Purpose: The laying hen is the only animal model which spontaneously develops outer surface epithelial cancer similar to human ovarian cancer. Dietary intervention has proven to slow the mechanisms of breast, colon, and prostate cancer, suggesting that a potential therapeutic treatment for ovarian cancer slowing the progression of the disease exists. Omega-3 fatty acids in diets have shown to be preventative of breast cancer and may be critical for suppression of ovarian cancer. Several enzymes and proteins including COX-1, COX-2, E-Cadherin, and N-Cadherin have been found to play a critical role in the development of ovarian cancer. The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on 1) various proteins in the development of ovarian cancer and 2) physical changes and overall health in the laying hens and their reproductive tracts. <br><br>Procedure: A 10% flax seed enriched diet on 200 2.5-year-old hens for one year was implemented prior to experimentation to determine the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor development. Tissue samples were extracted from the hens, and then fixed, embedded, and used in histological and immunohistochemical stains.<br><br>Data & Conclusions: The flax seed hens showed a significant decrease in COX-1 and COX-2 expression or mRNA in total OSE compared to control birds. The immunohistochemical stains showed a reduction of the COX enzyme in the flax-fed hens. Although there was a significant decrease in COX enzymes and although COX enzymes are crucial in the production of prostaglandins, specifically in eggshell formation, there was no effect on the hen's egg-laying frequency. These observations may provide information critical to a therapeutic treatment of flax seed as a chemosuppressant for ovarian cancer.

OVEREXPRESSION OF AQUAPORIN-1 IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER
Sushma Kola
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

The aquaporins are newly discovered channel proteins that regulate water transport across cell membranes. Since most tumors exhibit high vascular permeability and interstitial fluid pressure, a possible role of aquaporins in tumor angiogenesis, growth, and spread has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) in various types of lung cancers (52 adenocarcinomas, 12 bronchoalveolar carcinomas, 25 squamous cell carcinomas) by immunohistochemical staining. <br><br>Tissue microarrays (TMAs) of lung cancers were stained with AQP-1 antibodies to identify expression of AQP-1 in non-small cell lung cancer. Results of this study demonstrate a significant correlation between AQP-1 expression and histologic subtypes of lung cancer. <br><br>AQP-1 was overexpressed in 69% (36 of 52) and 67% (8 of 12) of adenocarcinomas and bronchoalveolar carcinomas, respectively, compared to only 36% (9 of 25) of squamous cell carcinomas (P = 0.0049). Only 33% (2 of 6) of normal lung tissue overexpressed AQP-1, compared to 60% (60 of 100) of all lung cancer tissue studied (P = 0.1941). <br><br>Although further details on the molecular function of AQP-1 related to tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated, the results suggest a potential role of AQP-1 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer.

THE EFFECT OF RESVERATROL IN THE CARCINOMA OF THE COLON
Nismaliry Martinez Garcia
Carmen Belen Veiga High School, Juana Diaz, PUERTO RICO

Resveratrol is a natural compound with antioxidant properties found in grapes. Resveratrol has a lot of potentis Modified Eagles Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, penincillin and streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were maintained in an incubator at a temperature of 37oC and with 5% of CO2. Experimental groups of cells were treated with resveratrol at different concentrations and control groups were treated with DMSO vehicle. Protein extracts from control and experimental cells were used in Western Blot analysis to determine the effect of resveratrol on the expression of genes that are important for the regulation of cellular processes such as cell division, apoptosis and cell adhesion. It was found that resveratrol induced phosphorylation and activation of p53, a protein that is very important for apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Observation of cells under a microscope revealed that resveratrol induced cell death by a process that appeared to be apoptosis. The conclusion was that resveratrol can fight cancer by activating p53 which in turn induces apoptosis or death of cancer cells.al in cancer treatment because it can block the growth of cancer cells. The scientific question is: What is the mechanism by which resveratrol inhibits the growth of cancer cells? The hypothesis was that resveratrol can inhibit properties of cancer cells such as excessive cellular division, metastasis and migration thus blocking the formation of tumors. In this research, the human colon carcinoma HT29 cell line was used. Cells were maintained in cell culture bottles with 10mL of Dulbecco

PROBE SIZE DETERMINATION FOR THE DETECTION OF THE OMPC GENE IN SALMONELLA AND OTHER ENTEROBACTERICIAE
Dianicha Santana
Petra Mercado Bougart High School, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

This research seeks to determine the size of the probe that allows the detection of the gene OmpC in Salmonella and other Enterobactericeae. The problem was what probe size will detect gene Omp C in Salmonella and other Enterobactericeae? The hypothesis was that it is possible to detect the gene OmpC in Salmonella and other Enterobactericeae with a probe of 70 oligonucleotides. The strains used were: Salmonella enterica ATCC 49284, Escherichia coli ATCC 700926, Shigella flexneri ATCC 700930, Salmonella choleraesuis ATCC 9150 and Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 15038. Bacteria were grown in culture media for DNA extraction. DNA (g) was used as a template to amplify it using “multiple displacement amplification" (MDA) and Rep-PCR (204 bp). The 70, 17 and 204 oligonucleotides probes were used to test the presence of the gene. These probes were complementary to Omp C and Inv A. These probes were hybridized with products from MDA and rep-PCR. The 17-mer probe could not detect the presence of these genes. When the PCR product (204 bp) was used as a probe, it was possible to discriminate between Salmonella and other Enterobactericeae. However, the PCR product (204 bp) could be difficult to immobilize in a surface. The 70 mer probes detected their complementary sequence when were hybridized with MDA, although there was a false positive. When the hibrydization conditions were change to higher stringency, the probe was more selective for Omp C in Salmonella. Data analysis indicated that the 70-mer probe could detect the Omp C gene in Salmonella.

CONFIRMING THE IDENTITY OF A POPULATION OF CXCR3 POSITIVE CELLS IN CELIAC TISSUE
Molly K. Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

Celiac is a noncontagious autoimmune disease of the small intestine, triggered by gluten, found in many grains. The body destroys the lining of the small intestine in response to this protein. It affects 1 in 133 (2.2 million) Americans. 2.1 million Americans are undiagnosed. It is the only autoimmune disease where a trigger is known, and understanding its mechanism will open the understanding of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and others. <br><br> The previous year’s study led to the discovery that CXCR3 stained 2 distinct cell populations in celiac tissue, a large and small population. Morphology suggested the large cells are plasma cells. Their identity needed verification to further understand the celiac mechanism. <br><br> In this project, the antibody CD138, a common plasma cell marker, was used in an immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedure to determine if large cells that stain abundantly with CXCR3 in celiac tissues are plasma cells. The same large cells that stained with CXCR3 stained with CD138. For further verification, IHC was used with kappa and lambda immunoglobulin, more plasma cell markers. Again, the same cells stained and both clones of the immunoglobulin were present. <br><br> From the CD138 staining, I concluded the large cells stained with CXCR3 were plasma cells. Kappa and lambda confirmed this and added the information that this was an inflammatory reaction, because both clones are present. This information contributes to the body of general celiac research and presents one more piece in the picture of the autoimmune disease mechanism in general.

THE ROLE OF SERINE PROTEASE INHIBITOR KAZAL (SPIK) IN CANCER FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Felix Yide Lu
Hatboro-Horsham Senior High School, Horsham, PA

Despite the prevalence of cancer in the population, the etiology of cancer formation and development remains unclear. Defects and blockages in apoptotic pathways, which can result in inefficient immune-surveillance, have been suggested as important precursors to cell carcinogenesis. Immune-surveillance generally relies upon the apoptotic killing mediated by cytolytic granules such as granzyme A and B, which are secreted from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibition of these granzymes, possibly via apoptosis inhibitors, often leads to the escape of malignant cells from granzyme-mediated cell death and the uncontrolled expanse of these cells would ultimately lead to cancer. Recent studies show that a tumor associated protein called serine protease inhibitor Kazal (SPIK) is up-regulated in many types of cancer cells such as colorectal tumors, renal-cell carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, using mutation techniques, we show that over-expression of functional SPIK protein results in a significant decrease in cell susceptibility to granzyme A induced apoptosis. In contrast, the mutants over-expressing dysfunctional SPIK protein or blocking SPIK protein expression did not suppress Granzyme A induced cell apoptosis. It is therefore possible that the over-expression of SPIK in malignant cells triggers the resistance to CTL and NK cell mediated immune-clearance, consequently leading to uncontrolled cell expanse and the development of cancer. Based on this discovery, a new kind of drug may be explored, which might not only prevent but also treat cancer.

COOPERATION OF EPIGENETIC MARKS IN MAINTENANCE OF GENE SILENCING
Daniel Lipsman
Central High School of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA

This project addressed whether inhibition of two epigenetic gene silencing systems, DNA methylation and histone modification, would lead to sustained reactivation of an epigenetically silent gene. Reactivation of a silent Green Fluorescent Protein gene was measured in HeLa cells after single or combined treatment with Trichostatin A and 5-Azacytidine. Cells were set up on plates, with treatments varying in drug combinations and exposure between the experiments. The cells were analyzed using a Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter. The data were then put into FlowJo for graphical analyses. If fluorescence levels were above the control, the cell groups were continued and analyzed with the FACS each time they were split. The cooperative treatment experiment lasted for approximately 10 days until the fluorescence became low, compared to the 41 days of the pretreatment re-treatment experiment. <br><br>Combining TSA and 5-AzaC resulted in initial percentages of 43.3%, which quickly decreased. Meanwhile, the group treated with 5-AzaC alone resulted in a final percentage of approximately 14%. In the pretreatment re-treatment experiment, the TSA drug did not work, and so those results did not seem viable. At the same time, the pretreated group continued having high levels of fluorescence for over 5 weeks. The hypothesis that combining drugs would result in longer expression was not supported. Similarly, the hypothesis that longer exposure time would result in permanent reactivation was incorrect as supported by the results. Results from both experiments showed resilencing, suggesting a resilencing mechanism that was not inhibited, or possibly a third form of epigenetics.

THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF DNA VACCINE IN A MURINE ASTHMA MODEL
Yixuan Zhou
White Station High, Memphis, TN

DNA vaccine can prevent the induction of Th2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation in experimental models, when administered before or at the time of allergen exposure. This study investigated whether or not DNA vaccine encoding Bla g 1 could exert therapeutic effect on allergen-induced allergic airway inflammation in mouse model and explored the mechanism(s) of DNA vaccination in asthma specific-allergen immunotherapy.<br><br>Vaccine challenged mouse tissue was supplied.<br><br>Bla g 1 DNA vaccine significantly inhibited the development of airway inflammation induced by allergen and markedly reduced the serum IgE level. The reduction in eosinophil numbers correlated with a fall in levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Moreover, the polarity of the immune response upon in vitro restimulation with rBla g 1 is changed in Bla g 1-vaccinated mice, with a resulting decrease in Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 and an increase in the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. <br><br>These studies demonstrate that the immune response of hypersensitized individuals can be modulated by Bla g 1vaccination, preventing allergic airway disease upon re-exposure to allergen.

MECHANISMS OF PATERNAL NONDISJUNCTION IN CHROMOSOME 21
Archit Nitin Bhise
Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GA

Down syndrome occurs due to nondisjunction, which is defined as the failure of chromosomes to segregate during meiosis. Paternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21 accounts for <10% of Down syndrome cases, therefore, compared to maternally derived cases, little is known about paternally derived Down syndrome. The largest analysis of recombination and nondisjunction is presented here for a paternally derived population of Down syndrome conceptuses. The purpose of the study was to identify risk factors associated with nondisjunction of chromosome 21 within the sperm. This was done by conducting a genotyping analysis of 91 paternal families (each family consisting of mother, father and child). Individuals were analyzed for the amount of short tandem repeats in particular locations on chromosome 21 and then analyzed for reduced and nonreduced homozygosity and recombination. Through this, the cases were classified as meiosis I, meiosis II and mitotic errors. When the paternal ages of these cases were compared with those of the controls, no correlation was found. However, there was a skewed sex ratio of 1.67 males born for every female when meiotic paternal nondisjunction occurred. These findings further supported the Savage model because a meiosis I skewed ratio was not observed before. Furthermore, a disturbance was seen in sex ratios in the proximal-medial region of meiosis II errors which was attributed to the resolving of precocious sister chromatid separation. This research will certainly help spread light on the underlying mechanisms of paternal nondisjunction, to help us understand Down syndrome better and someday treat affected individuals.

THE IMPACT OF RESVERATROL: NATURAL ANTIOXIDANT ON ADIPOSE STEM CELL GROWTH, DIFFERENTIATION, SURVIVAL, AND GENOMIC STABILITY
Suraj K. Mishra
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine if Resveratrol, a phenolic antioxidant, can enhance adipose stem cell growth/differentiation, increase survival, and exhibit lower oxidative species when induced with hydrogen peroxide. The constant variable of this experiment was the concentrations of Resveratrol. The type of differentiation (Myogenic or Adipogenic) or the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were administered to the cells, depending on the type of the study. The dependent variables were observed effects of differentiation, survivability, and redox stress. Images of cells from Myogenic and Adipogenic differentiation were used to determine any positive factors of Resveratrol enhancing and showing healthier differentiation. Hydrogen peroxide was induced in undifferentiated Resveratrol treated cells for 4 days and cell survival was recorded using the Trypan blue viability test 8 days following hydrogen peroxide treatment. The redox assay was then done to determine any significantly less damage to cell’s DNA when induced with Resveratrol. Myogenic and Adipogenic differentiation were enhanced when induced with Resveratrol, but future work of testing differentiated cells in a natural environment will be done. The ANOVA test significantly proved an interaction between Resveratrol and Hydrogen Peroxide on cell natality, showing increased survival with Resveratrol treatment. The redox assay determined that damage to the cell’s DNA was much lower with cells induced with Resveratrol, exhibiting inhibiting factors against dangerous oxidants and free radicals to DNA such as hydrogen peroxide. Future experimentation includes monitoring telomere length to determine any anti-aging effects and to study anti-cancer activity by this powerful antioxidant.

A SECOND YEAR STUDY OF NEURONAL VARIABILITY IN THE GASTROPOD, LYMNAEA STAGNALIS
Joel Eduardo Garcia
Weslaco High School, Weslaco, TX

The goal of my project was to study the plasticity of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis but I had to study the variability first which is what I did last years and this years project. I studied the right pedal ganglion and analyzed the giant-dopamine containing neuron R.Pe.D.1. <br><br>In phase II of my project I examined the structural features of the right pedal ganglion, a structure in the snail’s brain that controls breathing and locomotion. Specifically I studied the primary and secondary branches of the neuron R.Pe.D.1 using DiI labeling. I would then analyze the labeled neurons under a fluorescent microscope and take photographs for further analysis. <br><br> <br><br>After months of hard work my results have shown that there is a primary axon that comes out of R.Pe.D.1 and remains constant in every experiment. I have begun to use a micro injector that mounts on to my micromanipulator in order to get cleaner injections. When I complete my study of variability in the nervous system in the near future I plan to study the plasticity of it. I plan to manipulate the experiences and see whether the structure of the brain changes.

MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF THE HEME UPTAKE PROMOTER REGION OF BARTONELLA QUINTANA
Amanda Rainy Lockwood
Hellgate High School, Missoula, MT

Bartonella quintana is a human pathogen that needs an excessive amount of heme, acquired from hemoglobin in red blood cells of the host, to grow in vitro. There is a cluster of genes within B. quintana, tentatively titled the heme utilization/transport (Hut) locus. Within this locus, there is tonB; encoding a putative energy transducer and hutA; encoding a putative heme receptor. HutA has been shown to function as a TonB-dependent hemin receptor in an E. coli strain deficient in the enzymes required for hemin biosynthesis. Preliminary research suggests that the transcriptions of those genes are subject to hemin-responsive regulation. The genetic arrangement suggests that they may be divergently transcribed. In order to test this hypothesis, we used 5’ RACE analysis to map the transcriptional start site of these genes. The transcriptional start site for tonB has been found 40 base pairs 5’ of the start codon. The hutA transcript is 121 base pairs 5’ of the start codon. The hutA and tonB are back to back divergently transcribed. The regulatory elements between hutA and tonB are unknown. Further analysis of the promoter regions and of the hut locus is underway.

INTERLEUKIN-6 SIGNALING IN CAVEOLIN-1 DEFICIENT MICE: THE ROLE OF STAT-3 PHOSPHORYLATION
Laura Lynn Lee, Joaquin Covarrubias, 
Mirkwood High School, Charlotte, NC

This project arose obliquely from an internship at the UNCC Hepatic Injury and Repair Lab. The lab is working under a NIH grant to study the mechanisms of hepatic sepsis down to the molecular level. <br><br>In this project we investigated the possible disruption within the hepatic IL-6 signaling pathway, specifically to test whether if the disruption of signaling in Caveolin-1 deficient mice (Cav-1 -/-) involves the Stat3 proteins. Our hypothesis for this project is that the interference of the IL-6 signaling pathway in Cav-1 -/- involves reduced phosphorylation of the Stat3 protein (Stat3). We were able to compare the ratios of PStat3 and Stat3 in both Cav-1 +/+ and Cav-1 -/- livers by using the Western Blot technique. The Cav-1 +/+ Control proved to have a statistically significant lower expression of Stat3 when compared to Cav-1 -/- Control. For PStat3 Control there was no difference in expression of PStat3. In IL-6 treated samples, Cav-1 -/- had a higher expression of both PStat3 and Stat3. These results did not support our hypothesis. Additional experiments are in progress to increase the statistical reliability.

THE DOWN-REGULATION OF COMPLEMENT REGULATORY PROTEIN CD59 AND ANTI-TUMOR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THERAPY
Ruowan Lucy Yan, Melissa Hou, 
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Nonspecific cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation destroy both malignant and regular cells. Anti-tumor monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy is specific; it targets cancer cells and mediates cytotoxicity through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and other mechanisms. However, many cancers up-regulate complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) that impede complement activation, thereby escaping destruction. For example, CRP CD59 can prevent membrane attack complex formation – preventing CDC. Consequently, mAb therapy as a monotherapy is not very effective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether down-regulation of CD59 increases mAb therapeutic efficacy. It was hypothesized that short interfering RNA (siRNA) down-regulates tumor cell CD59 expression – allowing CDC to occur. <br><br> SKOV-3 (human ovarian cancer) cells were transfected with synthetic CD59 siRNA and CD59 expression was determined using flow cytometry. While the 150mg/ml and 300mg/ml showed no significant decrease in CD59 expression, 600mg/ml did. When a time trial was implemented, the down-regulation did not last, indicating a transient effect. To combat this problem, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to induce permanent gene silencing. shRNA plasmids (ID1-ID4) were amplified, purified, and transfection was performed, followed by CD59 expression determination. A mAb-mediated CDC assay comparing cytotoxicity levels between transfected and parental cells was also completed. <br><br> Results showed that ID4-CD59-shRNA-transfected cells significantly down-regulated CD59 and also produced the highest cytotoxicity. This data support the hypothesis that CD59 down-regulation increases mAb therapy efficacy. Further studies include expanding the methodology to other cells that up-regulate CD59. Also, an in vivo mouse model can be developed to validate in vitro results.

LOSS OF RPB1 INDUCES G1 ARREST IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Sajith M. Wickramasekara, Yukun Yao, 
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been a staple of biomedical research in the battle against cancer due to its evolutionary conservation with human cells. When the tumor suppressor BRCA1 is heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae, a cleavage of the RNA Polymerase II’s carboxyl terminal domain occurs. In addition, the cells undergo a G1 cell cycle arrest and experience lethality. To further investigate this interaction, we replaced the genomic Rpb1, the large subunit of the RNA Polymerase II, with a plasmid-borne copy containing a synthetic CTD and we expressed BRCA1. As expected, cell lethality after a G1 phase arrest occurred. However, we observed a novel phenomenon involving cell enlargement. This enlarging effect resulted in the cell diameter swelling fourfold and lysis occurring within 3-4 days. Continued size expansion would be impossible without the synthesis of additional cell wall components. Proper utilization of this enlargement effect may unlock doors to an alternate protein expression system, improve drug therapy through utilization of spontaneous lysis, and provide insight into enigmatic checkpoint arrest and cell cycle mechanisms.

LINK BETWEEN AUB AND GCL DURING OOGENESIS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Shiru Liu, Shiyan Liu, 
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, CANADA

Drosophila melangonaster is a commonly used model organism in the study of developmental genetics. In Drosophila’s meroistic oogenesis, maternal gene products are expressed and localized to discrete regions, which are necessary for germ cell formation and asymmetrical embryonic development. The expression and localization of these genes are highly controlled and regulated via interaction with each other in a specific manner. Studies show that both maternal germ cell less (gcl) and aubergine (aub) are genes required for germ cell formation and have similar localization in the ovaries. We are interested to know if aub can regulate gcl activity and vice versa. <br><br>Our experiment involves two major procedures: Immunostaining and Western Blot. We examined the gcl and the aub female mutant flies and compared them to the wild type flies. Results using confocoal microscopy from Immunostaining show that the localization of Aub protein is not affected in gcl mutants. Results from Western Blot show that the expression of Aub is also independent of gcl, but the expression level of Gcl has slightly reduced in aub mutants, showing that these two genes are not completely disconnected from each other. <br><br>Therefore, we can conclude that Aub expression and localization are gcl-independent, but the possibility of aub regulation on Gcl expression and localization cannot be excluded. Further experiments are needed to elucidate this issue. Since these genes are conserved among many species including humans, seeking links in gene regulation might provide further insights to the mechanism of germ cell development in humans as well.

MECHANOCHEMICAL REGULATION OF CELL BEHAVIOR: FROM NANOFIBERS TO NANOPARTICLES
Pooja Rajalakshmi Vasudevan, Radha Ramjeawan,

Current modalities of cancer treatment by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation result in unavoidable damage to normal tissue. This study is designed to attack cancer cells while restoring normal human tissue functions through engineering nanostructured materials. Protein-coated nanoparticles were synthesized to first specifically target the tumor site. A 3-D nanofibrous scaffold was engineered to encourage growth of normal cells. Embedded protein-coated nanoparticles specifically targeted the cancer cells while preserving normal cell architecture. The 3-D fibrous scaffold was engineered through the process of electrospinning, and AFM and SEM were utilized to characterize the fibers. TEM confirmed nanoparticle synthesis. Confocal images show that the fibrous scaffold selected the normal keratinocytes to adhere and follow the orientation of the aligned fibers. However, the cancerous keratinocytes attached to the fibers but did not follow the linear orientation. On direct cell contact, the synthesis of the nanoparticles had an adverse effect on cancer cells by distorting cell shape, growth, and internal cytoskeletal architecture. Furthermore, the protein-coating of the nanoparticles worked to specifically target cancer cells while preserving normal cell morphology. This study demonstrates the major impact of nanoscale devices in tissue engineering and cancer therapy.

EXPLORING THE ROLE OF THE CRYPTOCHROME 1/2 GENE IN THE RESTORATION OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHM
Marissa Pan, Kelsey Schodowski, 
Alpharetta High School, Alpharetta, GA

Circadian rhythm is the metabolic rhythm describing the internal body clock that regulates most organisms’ daily activity including biochemical, behavioral, and physiological output. In the body circadian rhythms are regulated by the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) and subordinate peripheral clocks. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes help in generating and maintaining that clock. In the present study behavioral rhythms of Cry 1/2 double mutant mice were analyzed under 2 different low light intensities to determine whether circadian rhythm could be reestablished under constant light. The mice were housed in light-tight “coffins” and exposed to varying light cycles. Each cage was equipped with a wheel that was connected to a device which monitored movement. This data was then used to create actograms, graphs displaying the time and duration of activity. The activity of Cry1/2 double knockout mice placed in a LD cycle was masked by light. When placed in DD, the mutants lost circadian rhythmicity because of the absence of light cues. In LL of low intensities, the ultradian rhythms were restored at the behavioral level. This suggests a functional circadian clockwork in the SCN and reinitiation of self-sustained circadian rhythms in LL. The results imply that Cry 1 and 2 play an important role in controlling the body’s response to low light intensity. This may have future implications for various circadian disorders in humans such as Seasonal Affective Disorder.

EFFECTS OF TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA ON THE PROLIFERATION OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS TYPE 16 IMMORTALIZED HUMAN EPITHELIAL CELLS
Colby Taylor Foss, Claire Noonan, Meghan Brown
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a cytokine secreted by many cell types, is a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation. We explored the effect of TGF-beta on the proliferation of human papillomavirus type 16 immortalized human keratinocytes at both early (HKc/HPV16) and late (HKc/DR) stages of in vitro progression. Fifteen dishes of each cell type were cultured, and fed with media containing TGF-beta over a five-day period. Every 24 hours three dishes of each cell type were removed from the incubator and cell number determined by direct counting in a hemocytometer. It was hypothesized that in the early time intervals the cells fed with TGF-beta would at first be suppressed by the growth factor. However, as time elapses, it was further predicted that the cells would gradually acquire a resistance to the TGF-beta and eventually begin growing and dividing at an increased rate. The hypothesis was rejected: the HKc/DR cells had a resistance to TGF-beta until the fourth day, when the TGF-beta suddenly cut the cell-count in half. The HKc/HPV 16 cells followed a similar pattern; however, the cell count dropped on the third day, but continued to grow again at day four.

NUCLEOPLASMIN (NLP): REGULATOR OF HIGHER-ORDER CHROMATIN ORGANIZATION?
Maza Rose Tchedou
Carver School of Health Sciences and Research, Atlanta, GA

This project addresses Nlp’s potential interaction with insulators and the impact it may have on the formation of the higher chromatin structure known as insulator bodies. Previous research and published work have concluded that nucleoplasmin is a histone binding protein, but none have really looked at how its role in histone organization may impact higher structures. In addition, Nlp shows patterns of localization in the nucleus similar to other proteins believed to be involved in chromatin organization, namely insulator binding proteins. Using an allele of Nlp that contains a P-element insert within the gene (NlpEP3555) to disrupt Nlp expression, we can use immuno-staining to look at certain insulator proteins such as CP190, SuHw, and Modifier 2.2, to see if there is disruption of insulator bodies or the ability of these proteins to interact with DNA. Once these stains were done, we found that most of the bands of SuHw staining on the chromosomes from Nlp line that had an inserted p element larvae were relatively large and spaced out compared to the banding pattern of the wildtype. According to the data from the immuno-staining of polytenes, it appears that some SuHw and CP190 bands are wider when Nlp has an inserted p element as compared to that seen in the wild type OR line. Some of the bands with p element insertion of Nlp appeared a little darker than normal. The findings satisfy my hypothesis. It suggests that Nlp, impacts DNA organization, further research will be conducted to verify this.

FREEZING TOLERANCE IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE: IMPACT OF THAWING RATES AND CRYOPROTECTANTS ON CELL VIABILITY
Naeh Lyron Klages-Mundt
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

The most important components of cryobiology reside in cryoprotective agents and freeze/thaw methodologies, both essential for the recovery of frozen cells. The purpose of this study was to establish an optimal thawing rate following varying cryoprotection for freezing of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Major practical applications include biobanking and frozen-dough-technology. Various concentrations of sugar, polyol, and salt aqueous solutions were used, with de-ionized water as a control. Variable thawing rates included slow thawing on ice while at 4°C, room temperature thawing, and rapid thawing in a 37°C water bath. Cell suspensions were created, allowed to equilibrate, and then frozen at -20°C. Initial samples were prepared with immediate plating. Following 48 hours of frozen storage, the cell suspensions were obtained and thawed appropriately. The suspensions were diluted before proceeding with the cell plating procedure. Incubation took place for 72 hours at 30°C. The number of colony forming units was determined and compared to the respective initial sample to determine viability. Slow and moderate-thawing rates generally improved survivability following sugar cryoprotection. Room temperature thawing provided the highest viabilities for disaccharide sugar cryoprotectants. Sugars act as non-penetrating agents, protecting extracellular spaces. Increased sugar concentrations generally improved viability, while the inverse held true for glycerol, suggesting polyol cytotoxicity. Sodium glutamate yielded substantial viability after room temperature thawing. This study suggests further exploration of specific sugars and sodium glutamate for biobanking and utilization of yeast for frozen-dough-technology. Subsequent research could enhance the understanding of specific cryoprotectant interactions and natural freezing resistance mechanisms in microbial species.

EFFECT OF CYTOTOXIC CHEMICALS ON APOPTOSIS IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Sarah Elizabeth Guthrie
Boulder High School, Boulder, CO

Apoptosis is a mechanism of programmed cell death often dysregulated in neurological diseases and cancer. Betulinic acid (BetA), derived from white birch (Betula pubescens), induces apoptosis in sixteen cancer cell lines, including drug resistant lines. BetA is hypothesized to induce apoptosis by antagonizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in a context-dependent manner. I used ced-1 C. elegans, which have a genetically sensitive background to apoptosis, to determine BetA’s effect on apoptosis. To determine if BetA targets CED-9, I used ced-1; ced-9(ts) worms, which have an inactive Bcl-2 homologue CED-9. I used this information to investigate how BetA selectively induces cancer cell death. I quantified apoptotic cells in the germline of C. elegans treated with BetA or a DMSO control. My prediction was that BetA would increase the number of apoptotic cells relative to the control in ced-1 worms, but that it would have no effect in ced-1; ced-9(ts) worms. BetA was found to increase apoptosis by 10% in the ced-1 background, though this trend was not found to be significant. BetA had no effect in the ced-1; ced-9(ts) background. These results indicate that BetA has a slight effect on apoptosis, probably in a ced-9-dependent manner. Further experimentation is warranted to determine BetA effects in a highly sensitized system in C. elegans and to determine which protein BetA effects. Further experimentation determining effects on apoptosis in C. elegans by other cytotoxic chemicals including crocin and allicin is suggested.

LOCALIZATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF ATAXIN-1 IN NORMAL CELL LINES AND ALZHEIMER’S-MUTATED CELL LINES AND AN EVALUATION OF NICOTINE- AND THC-INDUCED MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION
Prachiti H. Dalvi
International Baccalaureate at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

Even in this era of accelerated scientific knowledge and technological innovation, the lives of 5 million Americans are dictated by the progressively deteriorating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. This neurodegenerative disease is invariably characterized by beta-amyloid plaque formation and chronic inflammation. Deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide, produced as a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein, is a neuropathological hallmark of AD. The ataxin-1 protein, a component of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway, has been identified as playing a role in neurodegeneration and aggregation. A fundamental development in the process of neuroinflammation is the activation of microglia. Upon the detection of neuroinflammation by the innate immune system, microglia are activated, releasing cytokines, and eventually causing neurodegeration. The localization of ataxin-1, a determination of relative levels of ataxin-1 in normal and Alzheimer’s-mutated cell lines, an affirmation of ataxin-1’s role in cell viability, and an analysis of the co-administration of nicotine and THC were the objectives of this study. Immunohistochemistry assays revealed ataxin-1 to be an intracellular protein which was expressed to a higher degree in normal cell lines. Ataxin-1 protein levels varied inversely with beta-amyloid levels indicating that higher levels of ataxin-1 in the brain could induce the desired effect of fewer beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Cell proliferation was decreased in cells expressing higher levels of ataxin-1 confirming that ataxin-1 is implicated in neurodegeneration. The immunohistochemistry assays of the mice brains peritoneally treated with the co-administration of nicotine and THC exhibited a minimized cytokine-mediated pro-inflammatory response of the immune system.

ENHANCED EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCING INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN FIBROBLASTS THROUGH LENTIVIRAL EXPRESSION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
Kyle Jones
The Villages High School, The Villages, FL

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are derived from somatic cells through expression of genes known as pluripotency transcription factors. Current methods of producing iPS cells have not been very efficient, hindering the potential applications of iPS cells. The purpose of this research is to develop a method to improve the efficiency of generating iPS cells from human fibroblasts by increasing the rate of vector transduction.<br><br>It was hypothesized that when the four genes Oct3/4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28 are ligated together in a single pTYF plasmid it can be used to enhance the transduction efficiency and increase iPS cell development from fibroblasts by several fold. Also it was hypothesized that ligating SV40 Large T Antigen to the plasmid will enhance the efficiency.<br><br>A plasmid vector containing the genes Oct3/4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28, as well as T antigen, was developed. E. coli transformation was conducted to produce large numbers of the plasmids. Fibroblasts were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum. The four genes were expressed in the fibroblasts through lentiviral transduction. After iPS cell colonies were developed, immunostaining, cell viability assays, and embryoid body formation assays were conducted.<br><br>Results indicated a 30 fold increase in the number of iPS cell colonies using the novel plasmid than the other methods used in the past have been able to produce. Assays indicated that the iPS cells maintained full pluripotency.<br><br>These results indicate that the plasmid developed in this project does enhance the efficiency of producing iPS cells by approximately 30 fold.

CONTROL OF CELL DIVISION BY THE MUSASHI PROTEIN
Sarah Budney Stanger
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

The purpose of this experiment was to examine how the Musashi protein regulates mRNA translation under differentiating and proliferating conditions in PC 12 cells. Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells found in brain tumors that share similar characteristics to neural stem cells like self-renewal and differentiation. The RNA binding protein, Musashi, has the ability to support differentiation and self-renewal in diseases by repressing the translation of certain mRNA molecules. Musashi targets mRNAs that code for proteins which regulate whether or not cells grow out of control. Musashi regulates the target mRNAs by binding to a PRE (polyadenylation response element). Firefly Luciferase assays and Western blots were used to test the concentration and activity levels of Musashi in differentiating PC 12 cells treated with Nerve Growth Factor. The results of the Firefly Luciferase assays indicated that in one day differentiating PC 12 cells, Musashi did not block the translation of mRNA (translation was de-repressed). Furthermore, although the concentration of Musashi decreased over time in all Western blot trials, the Musashi levels in differentiating PC 12 cells were higher than those in control (proliferating) cells after one day. This illustrates that PRE containing mRNAs regulated by Musashi can be translated even when Musashi is present and that Musashi promotes the transition from proliferation to differentiation in PC 12 cells because the concentration of Musashi consistently increased from proliferating to one day differentiating PC 12 cells. Once researchers learn how the cell regulates Musashi activity, Musashi-caused cancer may be controllable.

USING A MOTILITY ASSAY TO DETERMINE MEMBRANE INTEGRITY OF LONGLEAF PINE TERPENES
Katherine Ann Smith
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

In previous years, it was determined that a longleaf pine extract increased mortality in protozoa. The goal of this experiment is to determine the mechanism of inhibition of longleaf pine terpenes. It was suggested that terpenes affect the mitochondria and membranes of microorganisms (Andrews, Parks, and Spence), but no study has shown definitive results regarding membrane inhibition.<br><br> Paramecia were exposed to aluminum fluoride (a substance with known effects on dynein ATPase) and ethanol, which breaks down cell membranes. These chemicals were used as positive controls because the two primary components that affect motility are the membrane and the cilia. The research hypothesis stated that cultures of ciliated protozoa exposed to aluminum fluoride would have the strongest inhibition of motility, while ethanol, α-pinene, or β-pinene would have a lesser inhibition of motility and would have comparable motility.<br><br>Paramecium cultures were exposed to the chemicals in the following concentrations: 1M, 0.5 M, and 0.1 M. The speeds of twenty-five Paramecium were recorded for each group. <br><br>After statistical analyses were run on the data, it was concluded that cultures exposed to aluminum fluoride had the greatest inhibition of motility, while groups exposed to ethanol or the terpenes were statistically identical to each other. The research hypothesis failed to be rejected. The method of inhibition may be related to an effect on the membrane integrity. Confirmation of these results will be achieved by using a plasmalemma-specific stain on the cultures of Paramecium.

TARGETING ONCOGENE PELP-1 USING SIRNA NANOPARTICLES
Adrian Garcia
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Breast cancer is the commonest malignant disease in American women, killing 40,390 victims in 2008. Approximately 80% of all breast cancers start as hormone-dependent. Estrogen Receptors play a role in the hormonal proliferation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, studies have identified PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and luecine-rich protein-1) as a coactivator of Estrogen Receptors. PELP1 expression in breast cancer cells promotes estrogen-mediated tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a method composed of nanoparticle and RNAi (RNA interference) technologies to prevent the expression of PELP1, thus allowing the inhibition of PELP1 expression with minimal side-effects. <br><br>Nanoparticles were produced using ionic gelation of tripolyphosphate (TPP) with chitosan, a naturally occurring sugar present in the exoskeleton of crustaceans. The size of the nanoparticles size was determined through dynamic light scattering microscopy. In vitro studies were conducted with MCF7 and ZR75 breast cancer model cells expressing fluorescent tagged PELP1. Breast cancer cells were treated with PELP1-sRNA nanoparticles and qualitative data was obtained through fluorescence microscopy and SDS-Page analysis. Biological significance of PELP1 siRNA was measured by monitoring cell proliferation using MTT assay.<br><br>Results showed that PELP1 siRNA nanoparticles significantly down-regulates expression compared to control siRNA nanoparticles. The results from these studies confirmed the hypothesis that PELP1-siRNA nanoparticles substantially reduce the rate of cancer cell proliferation (p-value of 1.97E-6). Based on collected results, it can be concluded that biodegradable chitosan-based PELP1 siRNA nanoparticles can be used to down regulate PELP1 expression in breast cancer cells leading to a decreased rate of cancer proliferation.

ROLE OF CD34+ AND CD14+ CELLS IN DIABETIC VASCULAR DISEASE.
Sabrina Lakshmi Prabakaran
Home School, Fort Myers, FL

Diabetic vascular disease is the leading cause of kidney failure requiring dialysis, peripheral vascular disease necessitating limb amputations, and retinal vascular complications leading to blindness. Bone marrow stem cell angioblasts generate CD34+ and CD14+cells. CD34+ cells are responsible for vascular repair. They replace damaged endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels, and are called endothelial precursor cells (EPCs). Diabetes impairs CD34+ cell functions. CD14+ cells form macrophages. Research Aim 1 is to improve diabetic vascular repair. Since CD34+ cells are impaired in diabetes, it is hypothesized that healthy donor CD34+ cells will provide vascular repair in diabetics. Research Aim 2 is to evaluate the role of CD14+ cells in diabetes. Since CD14+ cells share the same ancestor as CD34+ cells, it is hypothesized that CD14+ cells will convert to a CD34+ EPC phenotype in diabetes to compensate for the impaired CD34+cells. Normal and diabetic C57BL6 mice received healthy or diabetic donor CD34+ or CD14+ cells. The degree of incorporation of the injected CD34+ or CD14+cells into the retinal vasculature was assessed through fluorescent immune-histology and quantified. Results:<br><br>1) Healthy CD34+cells incorporated into diabetic vasculature whereas diabetic CD34+cells did not, supporting hypothesis one. 2) CD14+cells colocalized with diabetic vasculature suggesting conversion of CD14+ cells into a CD34+ EPC phenotype. Results were statistically significant (p> .05) compared to control animals. Diabetes affects approximately 23.6 million Americans or about 8 percent of the population. The role of CD14+cells in diabetes needs to be studied further. Research to provide for CD34+cell transfusions, similar to red blood cell transfusions for anemia may improve quality of life and longevity in diabetics.

A COMMON FOOD ADDITIVE INDUCES CELL MIGRATION AND NEOPLASTIC PHENOTYPE BY DECREASING ASB ACTIVITY
Prithwis Kumar Mukhopadhyay
Woodbury High School, Woodbury, MN

Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) have strong influences on cell adhesion, motility, invasion and metastasis. Carrageenan, a common food additive, structurally mimics sGAG and induces several adverse influences involving lysosome. On the other hand, Arylsulfatase B (ASB) is a lysosomal enzyme, which regulates sGAG/ chondroitin 4-sulfate content in cells. This study addresses the possible influence of carrageenan on cell membrane, ASB activity and migration/invasive phenotype of mammary epithelial cells. ASB and sGAG measurements in different types of mammary cells revealed that sGAG in malignant mammary epithelial cells is significantly higher and ASB activity is 3–4 times lower than that in non-malignant cells. Moreover, carrageenan treatment reduced ASB activity, and increased sGAG /chondroitin sulfate (CS) content in all cells. ASB silencing in MCF-10A cells increased sGAG from 4.426 (±0.224) ug/mg to 20.221 (±2.003) ug/mg of protein, increased CS significantly (p<0.001) over control and increased cell migration by about 67%. In contrast, overexpression of ASB decreased sGAG from 4.413 (±0.177) ug/mg to 2.076 (±0.127) ug/mg of protein, CS from 2.337 (±0.224) ug/mg to 0.111 (±0.008) ug/mg of protein, and cell migration to 45% of control. Observations further substantiate that non-malignant cells with higher ASB activity migrated 2.5–3.5 times slower than malignant cell lines. These results collectively suggest that carrageenan decreases the ASB activity and low ASB activity influences cell membrane composition by increasing sGAG and CS content. Thus carrageenan induces cell migration and invasive phenotype. These findings raise concern over the uncontrolled use of carrageenan in food.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL DETRIMENT: CELLULAR MUTATIONS AND INHIBITED GROWTH OF C. ELEGANS DUE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Alvin George Thomas
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are emitted by all devices consisting of a electronic circuit and they have raised health concerns including the possibility of cancer. In order to test their effects on biological organisms, the nematode C. elegans was used. C. elegans was choosen because ithas both a nervous system and a fully-sequenced genome. The C. elegans were allowed to grow for multiple generations, 10 petri dishes in EMFs and 10 petri dishes not in EMFs; mutations and general population size were used as factors and measurements for detrimental effects of EMFs. It was hypothesized that there would fewer C. elegans and a greater mutation rate for those C. elegans grown inside the EMF.<br><br>The results were then analyzed and compared to the researched genome to determine the affects of EMFs on gene determination and expression. The results show that the presence of electromagnetic fields does inhibit growth and result in cellular mutations which is relevant to the field of medicine and biomedical engineering – primarily constructing devices that do not cause disease. The data was tested using a two-variable t-test and found to be statically significant with a P-value under 0.0001. EMFs, affecting cell determination from the nervous functions to physiological structure in C. elegans, can be a cause of great concern to humans – especially if the quantity and/or strength of unsafe electronic devices increases.

ASSOCIATING CELLULAR ENERGETIC METABOLISM WITH PROSTATE CANCER CHEMO-RESISTANCE
Brinda Anusri Gokul
Jesuit High School, Portland, OR

Do factors within a prostate cancer cell predispose it to chemo-resistance? Cancer cells have distinct behavioral and physical differences than normal cells. Chemotherapy-the use of chemical treatment to cease the growth of cancer cells-has generally been found effective for many cancer patients. Prostate cancer patients who undergo a prostectomy and chemotherapy together are likely to go into remission, but some patients, reason unknown, develop chemo-resistance where their cells do not react to the therapy. In those cases, other options are tested but may not always be as promising. The question remains, however, as to why certain cells are prone to chemo-resistance any why others are not. Further, are functions of pathways involved in cellular energetic metabolism altered, potentially causing chemo-resistance or response? <br><br> <br><br>Data from a cellular ATP measurement was categorized into five metabolic pathway subcategories. After determining the extent of up- and down-regulation of each pathway, Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to estimate the impact of AMACR and Citrate Synthase gene expression on the disease outcome and effectiveness of treatment based on patients' relapse-free survival information. Lab procedures and analysis were both applied for final conclusion.<br><br> <br><br>It was found that over-expression of Citrate Synthase was linked to response to chemotherapy, while over-expression of AMACR was linked to resistance; thus confirming mitochondrial function changes in prostate cancer cells. Additionally, some gene expressions of metabolic pathways can affect a prostate cancer cell's sensitivity to chemotherapy.

TARGETING AKT3 SIGNALING PATHWAY IN CUTANEOUS MELANOMA WITH ISOSELENOCYANATE
Natalie D-T Nguyen
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

Melanoma is the most serious skin cancer with a strong tendency to invade and metastasize. For advanced melanoma, current drug therapies are virtually ineffective, resulting in high mortality rate. In the search for new treatments, phytochemicals were screened. Both Selenium (Se) and isothiocyanate (ITC) were found to possess anti-cancer properties. However, they were not sufficiently potent independently. To enhance their cancer killing potency scientists have synthesized new isoselenocyanates from isothiocyanates by increasing the alkyl chain and substituting sulfur for selenium. On the previous project, two novel compounds PBITC (Isothiocyanate) and ISC-4 (Isoselenocyanate) were tested on engineered human skin models and ISC-4 was found to be more effective at killing melanoma. However, their mechanisms of action are not fully known. Many signaling cascades are perturbed in cancer. Beside B-Raf, another common pathway up-regulated in 70% of melanoma is Akt3, a kinase which enhances cell proliferation and survival and inhibits apoptosis. This study examined the effects of these compounds on the Akt3 survival signaling pathway. The anticancer effects on less invasive WM35 and aggressive metastatic UACC903 melanoma cells were evaluated using three different assays: MTS (cell viability), BrdU (cell proliferation) and Caspase (apoptosis). The p-Akt (activated) and Akt3 proteins were detected through Western blots. The results showed that both PBITC and ISC-4 significantly decreased melanoma cell proliferation and viability, and induced apoptosis through caspase activation (P < 0.001). They appeared to inhibit Akt3 survival signaling pathway by blocking Akt3 phosphorylation (activation). ISC-4 was more potent than PBITC.

CANCER TARGET VALIDATION USING SIRNA
Felix D-H Nguyen
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural phenomenon in which short-interfering RNA suppresses expression of a target protein by inducing degradation of its mRNA. RNAi is a powerful tool for studying gene function. Cancer cells rely heavily on cell cycle for proliferation. Arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis are the goals of cancer treatment. Forcing cancer cells to divide too prematurely may cause cell death. Wee1 coordinates cell growth with division. Wee1 prevents cells from entering mitosis prematurely. This study examined the role of WEE1 in aggressive UACC903 melanoma and the effect of knockdown with siRNA. This experiment included an untreated control, two negative controls (DEPC and siScrambled) and a positive control B-Raf siRNA. The experiment was first carried out using pooled WEE1 containing 3 different synthetic siRNAs. Next, individual siRNA was tested for potency. Cells were transfected with siRNA. Cell viability and proliferation assays were performed. The results showed high viability in untreated and negative controls, but 75% reduction in viability in positive control B-Raf and a 70% reduction with pooled siRNAs (P<0.001). siRNA #2 and #3 had 60% and 70% decrease in viability, respectively while siRNA #1 was ineffective (P<0.01). Data for cell proliferation and viability were comparable, and 7-day time point was similar to 5-day time point. In conclusion, transfection technique using Amaxa nucleofector efficiently delivered siRNAs into UACC903 without causing cell death. Only siRNA #2 and #3 were potent in knocking down WEE1. Synthetic siRNAs remained effective for at least 7 days after transfection.

DOES THE ENZYME ACCELLERASE1000 AFFECT THE PRODUCTION OF FREE SUGARS AND ETHANOL IN AMMONIUM TREATED BAGASSE USING LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS HYDROLYSIS?
Kai Addriane Spraggins
Lighthouse Christian High School, Abbeville, LA

This experiment breaks down the cellular structure of a waste product called bagasse to produce ethanol. Two trials were performed. The hypothesis is that a new enzyme, Accellerase1000 will increase the production of free sugars and ethanol in ammonium treated bagasse just as sugars and starches would from usable food crops. Six experimental flasks of ammonium treated bagasse and four control flasks of untreated bagasse were prepared. Controlled amounts of water, buffer, and yeast extract were added. The pH of each was tested and adjusted to standard. All flasks were labeled and placed in an autoclave to prevent contamination. Varying amounts of enzymes were injected into the flasks under a hood. Two flasks received enzymes for a positive control and two control flasks received no enzyme for a negative control. The flasks were then placed in an incubator and samples were taken at time increments of 24, 48, and 72 hours. Samples were then tested for sugars. All flasks were again placed under the hood for yeast injection and placed back into the incubator. Samples of those flasks were tested for ethanol. Results showed that increases in enzyme concentration in the experimental groups produced glucose from 15 521.59 ml/25 g dry bagasse to 42 442.44 ml/25 g dry bagasse. When the yeast was added, 100% of the glucose disappeared from the experimental flasks of bagasse. The results also showed 44% converted to ethanol. Thus, Accellerase 1000 can be used an alternative means of producing ethanol without jeopardizing food consumption.

THE ANALYSIS OF IMMUNE RESPONSES IN R-V-4-1BBL VACCINATION WITH LYMPHODEPLETION IN B16 MELANOMA.
Alexander Gregory Mendez
Mamaroneck High School, Mamaroneck, NY

The primary goal of tumor immunotherapy is to generate a prolonged tumor-specific humoral and/or cellular response which has the ability to mediate tumor regression. One method of tumor immunotherapy involves the use of Cancer vaccines. Cancer vaccines are vaccines which stimulate the patient's immune system, and in turn produce an increased amount of antibodies and/or T-Cells that have the ability to kill cancer cells and prevent relapses of the cancer. This study sought to use a Vaccinia virus expressing the 4-1BBL molecule and also to use a method known as lymphodepletion.The goal was to generate a strong anti-tumor response that had the ability to mediate tumor regression. To further understand the antitumor immune response we sought to perform FACS analysis and to determine the quantity and activation status of CD8+, CD4+ T-Cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. After receiving the spleens which were removed prior to my experiment, I performed the FACS analysis. In summary, the overall CD8 T-Cell population was increased in the group treated with the rV-4-1BBL vaccine and the group treated with the vaccine and TBI. In addition, the TBI was effective in the activation of CD8 T-Cells and the downregulation of Treg Cells. In addition, tumor growth was significantly delayed in the vaccine and combination groups.

DESIGNING A NOVEL CANCER VACCINE AGAINST EGFR
Ross Anthony Bruck
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

Cancer immunotherapy offers many advantages over traditional therapies and has already made a profound impact on how cancer is treated. Specifically, vaccination with a portion of an oncoprotein could elicit a targeted and powerful immune response against oncoprotein bearing cells. One such oncoprotein is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is overexpressed in the majority of solid tumors, including colon cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In the present study, a panel of ten EGFR peptides were used as vaccines, and antibody response was measured in mice using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting. This study found that several EGFR peptides yielded strong anti-EGFR antibody responses, that these antibody responses were cross reactive with other EGFR peptides, but that they failed to bind to EGFR expressed on the surface of human cancer cells. This finding, that certain modified EGFR peptides are able to break immune tolerance and trigger a powerful immune response against cancer cells paves the way for further research by demonstrating that the vaccine method could potentially be successful in the clinical setting. Additionally, this study found that modified isoaspartyl peptides were more immunogenic and more cross reactive than unmodified peptides, which has important implications in the fields of both cancer immunotherapy and traditional autoimmunity. Future studies would include determining T-cell responses to the vaccines and measuring inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by anti-EGFR antibodies and T-cells.

AN IN VITRO METHOD OF SPROUTING ANGIOGENESIS REVEALS A RELAXATION FOR THE REQUIREMENT OF VEGFR2 SIGNALING FOR THE FORMATION OF ENDOTHELIAL-LIKE, PECAM-POSITIVE CELLS.
Elizabeth Cai
Briarcliff High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

Neoangiogenesis is a crucial process in cancer (tumor angiogenesis) and macular degeneration, and is the target of approved or under-development therapeutics. Most of these drugs target VEGF or VEGF signaling, long considered essential for tumor angiogenesis. <br><br>In order to study the role of genes implicated in neoangiogenesis, an in vitro method utilizing genetically modified Embryonic Stem (ES) cells was developed. Focusing on VegfR2 as a prototypical example, ES cell lines modified to be homozygous-null, conditional-null, or wild type for VegfR2 were examined for their ability to differentiate into endothelial cells (as judged by expression of PECAM) and organize into vessels (sprouting). Critical experimental parameters were shown to have no effect on sprouting, effectively establishing a robust protocol for the examination of the role of different genes in angiogenesis. <br><br>In this in vitro model of neoangiogenesis, VegfR2 was not required for differentiation of ES cells into endothelial cells, yet was necessary for their organizing into sprouts. However, VegfR2 null cells were able to contribute to vasculature when in the presence of wild type cells. This mirrors results obtained with ES cell-derived tumors in vivo, contrasts the requirement for VegfR2 for normal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during development, and points towards a possible explanation for the resistance of certain tumors to anti-VEGF therapies.

ACETYL TRANSFERASE INHIBITORS: A NEW TREATMENT FOR COLON AND CERVICAL CANCER?
Arun Brendan Dutta
Western Albemarle High School, Crozet, VA

Tip60 is a cellular acetyltransferase enzyme that assists in many cellular activities, including DNA repair. Unfortunately, Tip60 also helps repair cancer cells that have been treated with radiation and DNA-damaging drugs like Daunorubicin. So Tip60 activity must be suppressed in radiation- or Daunorubicin-treated tumors. Last year, I found two chemicals that inhibit Tip60 HAT activity, Anacardic Acid and Garcinol. This year I added these chemicals to colon (HCT116) and cervical (C33A) cancer cells along with Daunorubicin, which is already used in cancer treatment. <br><br>I used MTT assays to test short-term effects of the drugs and colony forming assays to test long-term effects. For the MTT assays, the cells were exposed to drugs and dye and then were read using a spectrophotometer. For the colony forming assays, drugs were added to cells for a day and then allowed to form colonies over two weeks. The number of colonies formed was estimated by a dye-binding assay. In both cases Garcinol killed cells surprisingly better than, and independent of, Daunorubicin.<br><br> Since Tip60 depletion by siRNA has been known to increase levels of phospho-H2AX in cells damaged by other agents like radiation or Daunorubicin, I used gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting and immunofluorescence to test whether Garcinol increased the levels of phospho-H2AX in cells. Surprisingly, Garcinol as well as Daunorubicin increased levels of nuclear phospho-H2AX. These results suggest that Garcinol can cause extensive DNA damage on its own and kill colon and cervical cancer cells in culture, perhaps better than the existing drug, Daunorubicin.

THE CARCINOGENESIS AND INVASIVENESS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA WITH IQGAP2 SIRNA TRANSFECTION
Jason Michael Littman
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

Hepatocellular Carcinoma, the most prevalent form of liver cancer, causes fatality among more than 600,000 people, worldwide, increasing annually. Many of the mechanisms of the carcinogenesis of Hepatocellular and Renal Cellular Carcinoma, as with many cancers, are currently unknown. IQGAP2, a multidomain scaffolding protein, is among a family of proteins known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of different cancers. Western Blot analysis confirmed the presence of IQGAP2 protein in hepatocytes and renal cells diagnosed with Hepatocellular and Renal Cellular Carcinoma. Quantification of siRNA transfection, resulting in knocking down the mRNA nucleotide sequence coding for the production of IQGAP2, illustrated a successful and efficient transfection. This led to an Invasion Assay of both cell lines to determine the effects of transfection on invasion. Hepatocellular Carcinoma cells transfected to reduce IQGAP2 production revealed a significant decrease in the invasiveness of the cells; contradicting the present murine model of IQGAP2 studies. Renal Cellular Carcinoma cells induced to manufacture additional IQGAP2 protein by plasmid transfection revealed an increase in invasiveness, correlating with hepatocyte results. Thus, IQGAP2 protein, whether induced or suppressed, was found to affect the metastasis of Hepatocellular and Renal Cellular Carcinoma cells. This, in turn, may lead to the development of IQGAP2 specific therapeutic agents to treat different cancers.

AML1-MTG16 CHIMERIC FUSION LEADS TO MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION ARREST
Odochi C Uwazurike
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) occurs when blood progenitor cells become incapable of normal differentiation. Major factors that lead to AML include chromosomal translocations that result in the fusion of two genes. The AML1-MTG translocation is hypothesized to be caused by epigenetic modifications to the cell's DNA sequence. It has already been established that an AML1-MTG8 fusion gene leads to irregular nuclear morphology and a block of differentiation. Since both MTG16 and MTG8 can recruit histone deacetylases, this research investigated whether AML1-MTG16 also blocks differentiation. Using an in-vitro model, murine 32D cells expressing the AML1-MTG16 chimeric fusion gene and control cells were cultured and samples were extracted for microscope evaluation on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Cells at 11 days of incubation displayed, on average, a 90% (p<0.001) block of differentiation when they contained the aberrant gene. Thus, this research has identified that the presence of the AML1-MTG16 fusion gene reduces differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells, thereby blocking granulopoiesis; and may be a causal factor of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Future work would include treating cells containing the fusion gene with chromatin-modifying drugs to test whether they can reverse the actions of the histone deacetylases recruited by the AML1-MTG16 chimeric fusion gene.

PLASMACYTOID DENDRITIC CELL NIBBLING AND MATURATION: A NOVEL MECHANISM LINKING INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY
Radomir Kratchmarov
Livingston High School, Livingston, NJ

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) link innate and adaptive immunity through the secretion of cytokines and presentation of antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells. Pathogens internalized by pDCs signal through sorting endosomes and induce a potent immune response involving natural killer and T cells. The pathways through which pDCs initially recognize pathogens in vivo are not entirely understood. As one of the first cell lineages to actively respond to foreign antigens, pDCs exhibit the novel phenomenon of antigen uptake from live cells through nibbling. The nibbling of infected material induces interferon-alpha production and chemotactic cytokine secretion. In the following study, pDC – tumor cell interactions were assayed to determine if pDCs efficiently mature into antigen presenting cells after ingesting pathogenic material during co-culture. Flow cytometry and microscopy visualizations show that ~75% of pDCs mature into antigen presenting cells after nibbling material from Raji lymphoma cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), suggesting that nibbling constitutes a critical link between innate and adaptive immunity in vivo. Furthermore, fluorescence in Raji cells treated with HSV-GFP virions demonstrates efficient viral infection of lymphoma cells and robust pDC maturation in response to infected tumor cells. Viral vectors targeted to tumors can therefore offer a triply effective cancer treatment that lyses cancerous cells, curtails immunosuppressive cytokine production, and induces an immune response against malignant cells.

DEVELOPING A HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN TO IDENTIFY SMALL MOLECULES THAT REVERSE ANTI-CANCER DRUG RESISTANCE: BFL-1 AS A MOLECULAR TARGET
Rachael Chi-Kue Lee
Walt Whitman High School, Bethesda, MD

Upregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bfl-1 contributes to chemoresistance to anti-cancer drugs. This project is designed to identify small molecules that inhibit Bfl-1 gene expression in human lung cancer cells. The first phase of this project was to create a cell line to screen for Bfl-1 inhibitors. Three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were tested for Bfl-1 messenger RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the A549 cell line had the highest Bfl-1 expression. To obtain maximal constitutive Bfl-1 promoter activity, different Bfl-1 promoter regions were cloned upstream of luciferase and an antibiotic resistance cassette and transfected into A549 cells. The region from the transcription start site to -1130 base pairs conferred the highest promoter activity. A549 cells were transfected with this construct and selected with G418 sulfate to achieve a cell line with the Bfl-1 promoter-luciferase reporter stably integrated into the genome. This stably transfected cell line was treated with the anti-cancer drugs etoposide and cisplatin, and both cytotoxic drugs upregulated activity of the Bfl-1 promoter and the Bfl-1 transcript level. In the second phase, a small molecule drug library was screened in a high-throughput format using a luciferase enzymatic assay, and two compounds were identified as inhibitors of Bfl-1. The results demonstrate establishment of a cell-based screen for small molecules targeting Bfl-1. The initial hits from the high-throughput screen can serve as tools to develop a compound to bring to clinical trial for the reversal of drug resistance in cancer patients.

PATHWAYS OF HEALING: DISCOVERING DITERPENE SYNTHASES IN THE MINT FAMILY THAT PRODUCE PROMISING DRUG CANDIDATES
Marton Spohn
Fazekas Mihaly Secondary Grammar School, Budapest, HUNGARY

White horehound (Marrubium vulgare) is a herb known to have anti-inflammatory and supposedly antiproliferative substances, mainly marrubenol and marrubiin. These are synthetised from a linear substance by two steps of enzymatic cyclisations having a by-product, copalyldiphosphate (CPP). The so called class II and class I diterpene synthases (TPSs) involved in producing similiar compounds have been already characterised in some plants, especially where the whole genome is known, eg. Arabidopsis thaliana.<br><br>To isolate TPS genes from the prepared Marrubium DNA extract, I designed degenerate PCR primers based on similiarities of known sequences from philogenetically far related but more similiar product outcome conifers (eg. Abies grandis), and closely related angiosperms that in spite have a different stereoisomer of CPP by-product. By polymerase chain reactions, I subcloned the isolated gene fragments into the cDNA of the respective TPS of Arabidopsis (obtained from a cDNA library), producing functional chimeric enzymes.<br><br>As step two, I characterised how the substituted sequences changed the functionality of TPSs. I introduced the full TPS pathway by co-expressing class II.&I. TPSs from Arabidopsis in E.coli as control, and transformed other strains using class II. and/or I. chimeric Marrubium TPSs substituting the respective steps of this pathway. I extracted reaction products from the bacterial cultures and identified diterpenes by spectrophotometry, TLC and partially by GC-MS.<br><br>As TPSs show stereoselectivity for CPP and Arabidopsis and Marrubium use different stereoisomer of this by-product, - beneath the Arabidopsis control - the cultures that showed diterpene production had proven to have both class TPSs functionally converted to produce Marrubium diterpenes. <br><br>Such recombinant/chimeric enzymes have a key future use in producing pharmaceuticals.

INVESTIGATING THE FRENCH PARADOX: RESVERATROL AS A POTENTIAL ANTIOXIDANT IN MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND GENOMIC STABILITY
Suraj K. Mishra
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA

The current goal of stem cell research is to fully understand and produce methods that maintain viability and efficiency during procedures such as stem cell transplantation. To achieve this goal, new supplements and safety measures must be developed. The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine if Resveratrol (RV), a phenolic antioxidant found in red wine that is the backbone of the “French Paradox” theory, can enhance Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (hAMSC) differentiation and maintain genomic stability. Resveratrol was tested in four differentiated pathways (neural, adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic) to determine if Resveratrol treated cells exhibited enhanced differentiation towards specific cell types. Resveratrol was also tested against concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to determine if the antioxidant protected against oxides, in preventing nuclei damage and cell death. Appropriate staining methods for the differentiated pathways demonstrated that Resveratrol treated cells exhibited more structured and accurate differentiation unlike the negative control, EtOH, or the untreated group. Also, cell survivability against oxides such as hydrogen peroxide increased with Resveratrol treatment. Finally, the redox assay’s image processing analysis gave strong statistical evidence supporting that Resveratrol lowers DNA damage to the nucleus. These findings fundamentally indicate that Resveratrol, because of its pro-oxidant capacities, is a potential antioxidant in mesenchymal stem cell processes in demonstrating enhanced differentiation, increased survivability, and lowered oxidative damage. Future experimentation will investigate Resveratrol’s effects in vivo and manufacturing a viable supplement or vitamin for the human body.

INTO THE MATRIX: REGULATION OF SMOOTH MUSCLE GENE EXPRESSION
Karissa Ann Miles
Westmoore High School, Oklahoma City, OK

This study evaluates gene expression changes in smooth muscle cells in response to growth factor stimulation. It is proposed that vascular smooth muscle cells change their extracellular matrix receptors during angiogenesis. The hypothesis was: SMC's would transition between the contractile and migratory phenotypes, and that this would alter the expression of integrins. RNA was isolated from VSMCs cultured under conditions that promote a contractile or migratory phenotype. PDGF-BB was used to stimulate the migratory phenotype, while PDGF-BB plus TGF-β, was used to induce a contractile phenotype. This RNA was used as a template to produce cDNA, which was then amplified using a polymerase chain reaction approach. PCR was performed using oligonucleotide probes specific for integrins alpha5, 6, 8, and V. PDGF-BB provoked a down-regulation of alpha6 and alpha8 and an increase in alpha5. Demonstrating that alpha6, an important laminin receptor, is significantly down-regulated suggests that this detachment may be a critical step in the ability of VSMCs to move away from basement membrane components towards the region of newly forming blood vessels. Importantly, remodeling tissue is associated with the formation of a transitional matrix consisting primarily of fibronectin, and the expression of alpha5 may be important for VSMCs to move into regions of new vessel formation. Co-stimulation of these cells with PDGF-BB and TGF-beta did not alter the response to PDGF-BB. These results suggest that PDGF-BB stimulates a switch in integrin expression, likely resulting in altered adhesion to the extracellular matrix. This switch may alter integrin-mediated signaling in the process.

THE EFFECTS OF SVP ON COLON, PROSTATE, AND OVARIAN CANCER.
Deepika Bhargo
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which snake venom protein (SVP) would be most effective at preventing the growth of three types of cancers cells: colon, prostate and ovarian. The three SVPs tested were Atroporin, Kaotree and Contortrostatin. The second reason for conducting this experiment was to determine if SVPs were targeting NFKappaB, a protein linked to apoptosis. Literary research was conducted to determine which cells (tumors, normal or both) the SVPs target. It was hypothesized that the Kaotree would be the most effective in inhibiting the growth of the three types of cancer cells, Atroporin would be the second most effective, and Contortrostatin would be the least effective. <br><br> A brief overview of the procedure includes the following. First grow the cancer cells in flasks. Transfer the cells to 96 well plates after conducting a cell count. After creating 2 fold serial dilutions, the SVPS were added to the wells and incubated for three days. The Cell Proliferation Assay was then added, and the plate was read at 490nm in a spectrophotometer. Additionally, an SDS-PAGE and a Western blot were conducted. <br><br> Results indicated that Kaotree was the most effective at preventing the growth of all three types of cancer. Although it had been hypothesized that Contortrostatin would be the least effective at inhibiting the cancer cell growth, results indicated that the Atroporin was. No data was obtained from the Western blot, which may indicate that apoptosis was induced. Future research is required to verify this.

SPONTANEOUS RENATURATION VS. CHAPERONE ASSISTED RENATURATION OF MYOGLOBIN
Demetrius Miles Murphy
West Side High School, Gary, IN

Acidic and basic ph changes can be used to study damaged proteins. This study can be used to understand the folding, unfolding and refolding of proteins. pH can damage the protein myoglobin. Some of this damage can be repaired spontaneously, and previous research has indicated that chaperone proteins (GroEL, GroES) may help repair myoglobin damage caused by pH as well. In this experiment, myoglobin was exposed to different pHs in order to examine its refolding by two different mechanisms: spontaneous renaturation and chaperone assisted renaturation. <br><br>Equine skeletal muscle myoglobin was used for this experiment. Myoglobin was denatured in a cuvette at three different pHs: 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5. Then 240 microL of renaturing solution was added. Some cuvettes had GroEL GroES and others did not. Shortly after, spectrums were run to compare the two types of renaturation mechanisms.<br><br>Spontaneous renaturation did take place but the chaperone assisted renaturation came closer to the original spectrum of the myoglobin. It was concluded that the chaperone assisted renaturation was more efficient then the spontaneous renaturation.

CREATION OF A FUNCTIONAL, GENETICALLY-TAGGED ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-ENHANCED GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN GENE TO STUDY ANDROGEN ACTION IN PROSTATE CANCER CELLS
Prateek Singh Baghel
Shaker High School, Latham, NY

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the androgen receptor (AR) localizes to the nucleus in androgen-dependent or androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through the production of a recombinant gene consisting of the AR and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) genes. The first step was to construct a fusion gene between AR and eGFP (called AR-eGFP) that could be inserted into 293T cells through Lentiviruses along with a reporter gene consisting of Gaussia Luciferase and the probasin promoter to test functionality. With exposure to R1881 (a synthetic androgen), there was increased Gaussia Luciferase production in cells expressing AR or AR-eGFP, indicating a functional recombinant protein. After proving functionality, we determined AR-eGFP localization in both low-passaged (LP) and high-passaged (HP) androgen-dependent LNCaP (prostate cancer cells) and in androgen-independent LNCaP in either androgen-deprived or androgen-stimulated conditions through fluorescent microscopy. In LP androgen-dependent LNCaP, nuclear localization of AR-eGFP occurred only in the presence of androgens. In the HP androgen-dependent LNCaP, there was evidence of some nuclear localization in the absence of androgens but complete localization in the presence of androgens. In androgen-independent LNCaP cells, there was significant abnormal localization of AR-eGFP in the absence of androgens and complete localization in the presence of androgens. It was concluded that the AR-eGFP gene expresses a chimeric protein that functions correctly in both 293T cells and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, we have concluded that the AR plays a significant role in the progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN A SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM IN THE RAD18 GENE AND COLORECTAL CANCER
Bruna Favetta
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a form of neoplasm characterized by its high incidence, severity, and delayed diagnosis. In the RAD18 gene (chromosome 3 p24-p25), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 302, encoding either arginine (Arg, CGA), or glutamine (Gln, CAA) was reported. The Arg302Gln polymorphism was genotyped in 50 patients and 83 controls by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) assay, in order to elucidate a correlation between this SNP with the development and progression of CRC. The electrophoresis of PCR products indicated that there were no samples with the Gln/Gln genotype, and the Arg/Gln genotype was not significantly more frequent in CRC patients (p>0.05), suggesting that the risk of development of CRC was not increased in individuals with the heterozygous condition (Odds Ratio, 1.28 ; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.59-2.75). The results also suggested a possible association between Gln/Gln genotype and the risk of CRC, since this condition could have been of such high risk that these individuals did not survive to participate in the patient group. To certify the accuracy of the PCR-CTPP, random PCR products were sequenced, which indicated that this method was not differentiating between heterozygote and homozygous variants. When the frequency of the genotypes in the patients was compared to clinic pathological parameters, an association between the presence of a Glutamine allele and the Aster-Coller staging system was established (Chi-Squared- 6.09, p=0.048), suggesting that there is a correlation between the RAD18 polymorphism and the progression of CRC. This study can provide a tool for early diagnosis and prevention of CRC.

Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Much research has been done to find correlations between aging and different aspects of lifestyle. My study focuses on an uncharted area of research, being Type A Behavior and whether or not it affects the length of telomeres, a genetic link to aging. <br><br>Questionnaires were constructed that included questions covering all aspects of lifestyle and an extensive survey to analyze and quantify the extent of Type A Behavior for each individual. Each of the individuals had varying behavior levels and worked to the advantage of finding a valid correlation between Type A behavior and aging patterns. <br><br>Relative telomere lengths were found using Multiplex Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with an added dissociation stage. By amplifying and measuring the fluorescence of the single copy gene (S) albumin, and comparing that to the fluorescence of telomere repeat products (T), a T/S ratio was established and used to determine relative telomere lengths. <br><br>This research is leading the way for an understanding of how personality affects the life expectancy of an individual. Many scientific studies are able to determine the varying stages of aging, whereas this research is focusing on the foundation of aging at a molecular level.

SHIP AS A TARGET OF MIR155: A NEW MODEL FOR LEUKEMIOGENESIS
Aaditya Ganesh Shidham
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH

A previous publication demonstrated the growth of a colony of E-miR155 transgenic mice that develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia/high grade lymphoma (Costinean, 2006). The present study uses the miR155 transgenic mice colony to characterize a new model of tumorigenesis. Here, it is shown that the miR155 transgene has higher expression in the precursor B cells than in the mature population, and that pre-B cells are at the origin of these leukemias. Ship (Src homology 2 domain–containing inositol-5-phosphatase), known to be an important regulator of the IL-6 (Interleukin-6) signaling pathway, was found in silico to be a direct target of miR155 and is gradually more downregulated in the leukemic than in preleukemic mice. This direct hybridization was confirmed in vivo through a luciferase assay. It is proposed that miR155, by down-modulating Ship, initiates a chain of events that acts exclusively in the domain of immature B cells and eventually arrests the growth of pre-B cell populations. This proposed mechanism leads to the accumulation and preferential proliferation of large pre-B cells, leading in turn to acute lymphoblastic leukemia/high grade lymphoma. The study thus proposes a novel mechanism of miR155-induced leukemiogenesis.

A GENETIC STUDY OF THE VON HIPPEL-LINDAU TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE
David Tianbai Zhang
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in humans cause devastating tumors in the kidney, retina, and central nervous system. This characterizes the inherited VHL disorder. VHL mutant tumor cells show increased cell migration and over-accumulation of cell surface fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR). <br><br>In the fruit fly, Drosophila, it has been previously shown in the laboratory that loss of function of VHL resulted in ectopic (abnormal) migration defects during tracheal development (Adryan et al., 2000). Such defects are very similar to the cancer metastasis process. Since human and fly VHL genes are highly similar, the Drosophila embryos provide an excellent animal model for studying this important human disease gene. <br><br>Using this system, detailed analyses were conducted on the behavior of VHL mutant cells in the trachea. It was found that these cells lost orderly movement. In severe cases, the cells moved away from the tubular epithelium, a situation very similar to cancer progression. Using genetic methods, it was shown that the VHL mutant defects (phenotypes) are caused by over-expression of the important fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR, and can be corrected by gene therapy. Statistical analysis was performed, and the results were found to be statistically significant. There was a relationship between the genotype and the rescue expressivity, so the null hypothesis is rejected. <br><br>The results indicate that VHL is involved in regulating the FGF receptor expression in the Drosophila trachea, suggesting a new potential therapy for the VHL-related cancer.

THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF P70 RIBOSOMAL S6 KINASE IN REGULATING MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL CARDIOMYOGENESIS
LeeAnn Kai-Yin Li

Optimization of stem cell applications such as stem cell transplantation to rescue diseased organs relies on comprehending underlying regulatory mechanisms driving differentiation of stem cells into tissue-specific cells. Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) is among the proteins upregulated in beating versus non-beating cardiomyocytes. In this project I tested the hypothesis that S6K plays a pivotal role in embryonic stem (ES) cell cardiomyogenesis, primarily because it regulates the translation of three 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs involved in key steps of cardiac development: connexin 43 (Cx43), desmoplakin (Dsp), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). I have confirmed with Western blots and confocal microscopy that S6K is indeed upregulated in beating ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes in contrast with non-beating cardiomyocytes. Observation of S6K siRNA-transfected stem cell cultures further indicated that inhibiting S6K strongly hinders development of cardiomyocyte beating and translation of Cx43, Dsp, and PTEN. As shown by Western blotting, these cardiac 5’ TOP mRNAs were only properly translated in cells with S6K, supporting my hypothesis. An unexpected discovery took the role of S6K one step further: S6K-knockdown stem cell cultures developed into more neurons than ordinarily seen even in neuronal stem cell cultures. These results introduced the novel idea that S6K may be a significant factor in keeping stem cells from pursuing a neuronal pathway, in addition to its critical cardiac roles. Overall, results have indicated the necessity of S6K for normal stem cell cardiomyogenesis to occur, as well as the necessity of S6K absence for neuron development from stem cells.

THE IMPACT OF POLYPHENOLIC COMPOUNDS ON APOPTOSIS IN EPITHELIAL CELLS
Mayson Dawn Husband
Latta High School, Ada, OK

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether polyphenolic compounds present in common beverages facilitate the process of apoptosis in epithelial cells. It was hypothesized that cells exposed to polyphenolic compounds would exhibit increased rates of apoptosis. It was also hypothesized that full strength solutions would have greater numbers of apoptotic cells than half strength solutions. It was further hypothesized that green tea beverages would produce higher percentages of apoptotic cells than other polyphenolic containing substances. <br><br><br> Epithelial cells were treated with seven different substances known to contain polyphenolic compounds. After exposure, the slides were prepared using a Fragmentation Detection Kit and examined microscopically. To verify the cellular results, DNA was extracted from liver tissue after exposure to the polyphenolic compounds. <br><br><br> Twenty-four slides were covered in both full and half strength solutions. Extracts from the steeped green tea had the highest percentage of apoptotic cells (11.61%, full strength; 6.18, half strength). The lowest percentage of apoptotic cells was found in the cells exposed to the cocoa solution (5.99%, full strength; 1.75%, half strength). <br><br><br> The results supported the hypothesis that cells exposed to polyphenolic compounds would exhibit increased rates of apoptosis (P=0.0014 and 0.0025). It was also supported that full strength solutions would produce more apoptosis than the half strength solutions. The results supported the hypothesis that green tea beverages would produce higher percentages of apoptotic cells since the steeped green tea and Fuze green tea had the highest percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis exposed to full and half strength solutions.

MICROSCALE PLATFORM FOR DETERMINING HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL FATE
Jane Yoonhae Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) hold great potential for treating many fatal diseases, but macroscale culture conditions restrict medical applications. Conventional macroscale culture systems do not accurately reflect the 3D in vivo microenvironment restricting knowledge of hPSC behavior and biology. Animal products for maintaining stem cell growth cause xenogenic contamination, making transplantations unsafe. Also, limited understanding of differences among different hPSC populations limits the selection of homogeneous target cells for regenerative therapy. In order to address these problems, a PDMS microscale device that reflects a 3D microenvironment was developed to sustain the growth and development of hPSCs and to determine stem cell fate. Feeder-free Matrigel coating at dilution 1:20 resulted in optimum stem cell growth and high expression of pluripotency factor OCT4, confirming the robustness of the microscale device. Different human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell lines (H1, HSF6, IPSA1, IPSB2), were cultured under various chemically defined culture media (StemPro, mTeSR, N2B27) to reduce problems with xenogenic contamination. Through immunostaining of cell cycle markers (DAPI, p-Histone H3 and EdU) and apoptosis (Caspase-3/-7), the fate of hPSCs at different stages of the cell cycle were efficiently detected. Quantitative phenotypic analysis characterized differences among different stem cell lines. This microscale platform represents an effective tool for maintaining optimum growth in a 3D microenvironment and for determining stem cell fate among different pluripotent stem cell populations. The precision, high controllability and small reagent consumption of this microscale platform can improve high-throughput drug screening analysis and transplantation therapies to help advance regenerative medicine.

CONSTRUCTION OF AN IGF-NAGLU PROTEIN FOR TREATMENT OF SANFILIPPO B SYNDROME YEAR 2
Carolyn Sinow
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS-IIIB), also known as Sanfilippo B Syndrome, is a genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). Synthetic NAGLU has not effectively corrected this deficiency because it has poor cell uptake. Attaching an Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) tag to synthetic NAGLU may allow the enzyme to enter cells using the mannose-6-phosphate receptor. The goal of this project was to use recombinant DNA techniques to create a plasmid coding for the production of a NAGLU-IGF-II fusion protein for preclinical testing as therapy for Sanfilippo B. <br><br> Isolated NAGLU cDNA fragments were ligated into plasmid pCI-IGF-II to create plasmid pCIGFNag. pCIGFNag underwent transformation and amplification using E.coli cells. Plasmids were extracted from the E.coli colonies, double digested, and screened using gel electrophoresis. DNA sequencing of plasmids verified correct insertion of NAGLU cDNA fragments. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with pCIGFNag to express the enzyme and characterize its biochemical activity. The CHO cell growth medium was assayed for NAGLU activity using a fluorogenic substrate; however, NAGLU activity was minimal. A Western blot was performed to further characterize the enzyme.

DEFINING FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS IN NATURALLY OCCURRING TELOMERASE MUTANTS
Katherine Taneille Johnson
North Peace Senior Secondary School, Fort St. John, British Columbia, CANADA

Telomerase is a specialized enzyme responsible for telomere elongation and stability. The majority of normal somatic cells (ex: cells that compose tissue, skin and organs) show limited telomerase activity, resulting in continuously shortening telomeres, eventually leading to senescence (natural cell death). Patients with certain hematological disorders, who have these mutations, also have shortened telomeres. I investigated the functional interactions in naturally occurring mutants of the protein catalytic subunit component hTERT, (Delta-V144M, A279T- not published at time of study) to understand why patients with these mutations have shortened telomeres (the biochemical impacts of these mutations). Defining the functional interactions, which occur in naturally occurring telomerase mutants, is an essential step in understanding the genotypic implications in disease, if any that may occur. Knowing the functional interactions and how a mutant biochemically impacts a cell’s processes can help determine the type of medication or treatments that are used. In vivo and in vitro analysis concluded that the A279T mutation does not impair telomerase activity; both protein and RNA are stably being produced- so why do patients with this mutation have shortened telomeres? I also concluded that the Delta-V144M mutation does impair telomerase activity, however, both protein and RNA are still being produced stably. Neither the Delta-V144M nor the A279T mutations appear have an immediate in vivo impact<br><br>on telomerase activity. Additional in vitro and in vivo analysis would have to be conducted to determine whether or not the Delta-V144M mutant acts as a dominant negative over wild type telomerase.

NOVEL TREATMENT OF HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES BY MODULATING TESTIS-SSPECIFIC PROTEIN, Y-ENCODED LIKE 1 (TSPYL1) AND FETAL GLOBIN INDUCING FACTOR (FGIF) GENE EXPRESSION: RNAI-MEDIATED GENE SILENCING AFFECTS GAMMA-GLOBIN GENE TRANSCRIPTION
Prarthana Jignesh Dalal
Shawnee Mission East High School, Prairie Village, KS

Hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia are common genetic diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. Hemoglobinopathies affect hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells. People with SCD have abnormal hemoglobin molecules which distort red blood cells into sickle cells. SCD is related to vascular complications and is associated with a high morbidity rate. Symptoms can be treated by reactivating human fetal hemoglobin which contains gamma-globin subunits. Regulation of human beta-like globin gene switching is controlled by several parameters and unraveling the mechanisms controlling gamma-globin gene expression is important for discerning new targets for therapeutic intervention. The human proteins testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like (TSPYL1) and fetal globin inducing factor (FGIF) represent potential targets for research. Using RNA interference (RNAi) to silence TSPYL1 and FGIF helps establish a correlation between target knockdown and gamma-globin gene expression. Use of silencing RNA (siRNA) specific for TSPYL1 proves the hypothesized correlation. Research is currently being conducted with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to further understand TSPYL1 and FGIF gene expression as it relates to gamma-globin gene expression. Ultimately understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling globin gene switching may aid in the development of novel therapies to effectively treat hemoglobinopathies.

EXPLORING A SEQUENCING-BASED HUMAN IDENTIFICATION METHOD AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CURRENT FRAGMENT SIZING TECHNOLOGY
Jennifer Shuen Chen
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

There is currently an enormous forensic DNA backlog, meaning a large number of DNA samples from criminals have not been analyzed to create DNA profiles and entered into the FBI Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database. Consequently, not all potential DNA profiles are in the database for comparison with DNA samples collected in the future. These DNA samples are used to provide evidence to determine the guilt or innocence of those accused of serious crimes, making this database critically important. My project explored an innovative way to reduce the backlog of DNA samples by proposing a more accurate, more efficient, and less costly method of human identification—ultra-high throughput (UHT) DNA sequencing. I tested my hypothesis by amplifying the miniSTR D7S820 locus of three individual samples with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). I then sized the PCR products by two methods: 1) agarose gel electrophoresis to represent the current fragment sizing technology and 2) Sanger DNA sequencing, a conventional sequencing method, to simulate UHT DNA sequencing. Gel electrophoresis yielded blurred bands that were very difficult to size, while the Sanger method produced clear sequences from which size and allele were easy to determine. Furthermore, comparing fragment sizing with UHT DNA sequencing showed the latter is both more efficient and less costly when dealing with a large number of DNA samples, such as those of the backlog. In conclusion, UHT DNA sequencing holds great promise as a more accurate, more efficient, and less expensive human identification method than what is currently used.

PREPARING TO DIE OR RECYCLING TO SURVIVE: INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APOPTOSIS AND AUTOPHAGY USING THE NATURAL PRODUCT, PALMEROLIDE A.
Katharina Sophie Yandrofski
Frederick High School, Frederick, MD

Palmerolide A was isolated from the Antarctic tunicate Synoicum adareanum and found to be potently active against human tumor cell lines in the NCI-60 panel. Recent data has shown that palmerolide induces autophagic vacuole formation, which is generally associated with cell survival by allowing for recycling of vital nutrients; however, palmerolide induces tumor cell growth inhibition and toxicity. Research has indicated autophagy may also be a form of programmed cell death, or lead to apoptosis under some conditions. In order to evaluate the relationship between these two processes, I used four isogenic baby mouse kidney cell lines that are either autophagy and/or apoptosis deficient, and assessed palmerolide induction of markers of autophagy and apoptosis. Protein measurement by Western blot analysis demonstrated autophagosome formation by transfer of cytoplasmic LC3-I to the membrane bound to LC3-II only in the autophagy competent cells (Atg5 +/+ and Atg5 +/+ BCL2) after 24h treatment with palmerolide. Unexpectedly, with the same treatment, apoptosis (as measured by PARP cleavage) was also induced more readily in both Atg5 +/+ and Atg5 +/+ BCL2 cells, compared to both Atg5 -/- cell lines. However, growth inhibitory and clonogenic data indicated that the BCL2+ cell lines were more resistant to palmerolide toxicity. With the data gathered thus far I must presume that autophagic vacuole formation caused by palmerolide treatments can directly relate to a greater induction of PARP cleavage. Thus, although the presence of BCL2 appears to protect the cells from palmerolide toxicity, this is not correlated with palmerolide-induced PARP cleavage.

TRANSFECTION OF SCRIBBLE SIRNA INDUCED FIBROBLAST-LIKE MORPHOLOGY IN A COLON CANCER CELL LINE
Kelly Christine Ramsburg
Urbana High School, Ijamsville, MD

Because scribble, a scaffold protein that establishes apicobasal polarity in epithelial sheets, acts as a tumor suppressor in Drosophila and three-dimensional sphere formation is a hallmark of cancer stem cells, I hypothesized that decreased scribble would occur in colon cancer cell lines treated with a sphere-inducing media, Serum Substitute (SS). The initial studies documented sphere formation in seven colon cancer cell lines after five days in standard conditions or SS. Morphologic changes were observed in all seven cell lines, although sphere formation varied. The least change occurred in COLO205, where cells were organized into an adherent monolayer with some dense clusters. Denser clusters and a less apparent monolayer were observed in HCC-2998 and HCT-116. Defined spheres were observed in HT-29, KM12, SW-620 and HCT-15. Next, scribble protein levels in cells in standard and SS conditions were quantified by Western Blot. Scribble was decreased in three colon cancer cell lines, COLO205 (30% of control), HCC-2998 (70%), and HT-29 (50%), when treated with SS. Of these cell lines, sphere formation was not consistent. Because scribble protein levels do not necessarily reflect function, scribble was down-regulated through siRNA transfection of three cell lines cultured under standard conditions. No spheres formed even though scribble protein levels were absent following transfection of two concentrations of scribble siRNA. However, HCT-116 cells became more fibroblast-like, a hallmark of invasion and metastasis in cancer (n=2). Under these limited conditions, scribble did not appear to modulate sphere formation, although it may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.

ANDROGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN MAMMARY CELLS: A NEW APPROACH TO CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER TUMORS LACKING ESTROGEN RECEPTORS
Niloy Jafar Iqbal
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

The Androgen Receptor (AR) pathway has long remained unexplored in breast cancer cells, in part because AR is mostly associated with prostate cancer, and also due to the obvious larger role of the Estrogen Receptor in breast cancer tissue growth. However, patients who do not express Estrogen Receptor, as well as pre-menopausal patients who produce endogenous estrogen have limited treatment options, leading us to consider AR as a new target for breast cancer treatment. There is a substantial body of literature suggesting that steroid hormone receptor (such as AR) activity is regulated by phosphorylation. We have used immunohistochemistry to show that AR and phosphorylated AR are present in breast cancer tissue. Using western blot analysis and densitometry, we have identified phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as an agent that induced phosphorylation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We have used an Androgen Response Element Luciferase Gene Assay to show that PMA acts synergistically with AR steroid hormone ligand to increase AR transcription. The data from these experiments provides the basis for further experimentation that can establish a new pathway for breast cancer treatment, which would focus on modulating the activity of AR. This new chemotherapy would be able to aid a significant population of breast cancer patients who cannot be treated today, such as pre menopausal and male patients.

OVER-EXPRESSION OF BUBR1 CAN PRODUCE ANEUPLOIDY IN HUMAN CELLS
Qi Fan Zhang
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Most cancer cells are aneuploid, the condition in which a cell has an<br><br>abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy is usually a result of defects in the mitotic checkpoint proteins. One such protein, BubR1, is pivotal in preventing anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. It has been proposed that an excess of BubR1 yields aneuploidy and ultimately cancer progression. To test whether over-expression of BubR1 leads to tumor proliferation, two cell lines, MCF10A (a stable mammary epithelial cell line) and MDA-MB-231 (an unstable tumorogenic breast cancer cell line) were immunoblotted in order to compare the BubR1 levels in each cell line. It was found that MDA-MB-231 contained more BubR1 than MCF10A. In order to explore the effects of the<br><br>over-expression of BubR1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, an immunofluorescence assay was conducted and it was found that the tumorogenic cell line entered anaphase prematurely. A chromosome spread was later performed to demonstrate that the cell line with an excess of BubR1 is more aneuploid than the cell line with a normal level of BubR1. To show the consequences of having an excess of BubR1 in cells, BubR1 was transfected under a constitutively strong promoter into a stable cell line and it was found that cells exit metaphase prematurely, resulting in aneuploid daughter cells. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between BubR1 and aneuploidy, and possibly cancer formation. Hopefully, we can use BubR1 as a mechanism to target cancer.

SEQUENCING THE FULL-LENGTH DNA BINDING/ZINC ION BINDING/ETHYLENE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GENE OF THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN CHESTNUT WITH CDNA LIBRARY COLONY LIFT, HYBRIDIZATION, AND GENOME-WALKING PROTOCOLS
Elizabeth Marie Shoenfelt
Skaneateles High School, Skaneateles, NY

This project focused on sequencing the full-length DNA binding/zinc ion binding/ethylene transcription factor gene from Chinese and American chestnut cDNA library stock cells since only a small, 461 base-pair sequence of Chinese chestnut cDNA is currently known. The full gene could be 2-6 times larger or so, and sequencing it for placement into a gene bank could be crucial in promoting further American chestnut conservation research, as identifying differences between the genes could advance knowledge of Chinese chestnut resistance to the chestnut blight fungus and American chestnut susceptibility to it. The procedure included a series of colony lifts from selective plates containing the cDNA library clones, the preparation of a probe from primers designed to isolate a small section of the gene for location of the proper colonies (those containing the ethylene gene cDNA as plasmids), hybridization of the blots with the labeled probe (to detect the colonies that hybridize with the probe oligonucleotide), positive-colony isolation from a chemiluminescent film detection, NCBI Blast of colony sequences, and a genome-walking protocol for sequences with ethylene-related hits. One of the positive-signal colonies of a Chinese chestnut hybridization yielded a putative ripening-related protein match from Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) mRNA, but further sequencing down the gene with the first set of genome-walking primers reduced its matches with any known ethylene sequences, suggesting that the isolated colonies did not, in fact, contain the target gene and were simply the product of non-specific probe/filter DNA complements due to hybridization temperatures that were too low.

THE EFFECTS OF UV RADIATION ON SUPERCOILED DNA: AN IN VIVO AND IN VITRO STUDY
Kyle Richard Rothschild-Mancinelli
Carlmont High School, Belmont, CA

Experiments on the effects of UV radiation are timely because changes in stratospheric ozone are causing solar UV radiation levels on Earth to rise, so UV-induced DNA damage (resulting in skin cancer) is increasing. While other studies have emphasized thymine dimer production, I have focused on whether current levels of solar UV radiation are strong enough to nick or break the DNA backbone. I hypothesized that in vivo, the DNA would show at least nicking after increasing exposure to UV radiation. As a prelude to this project, I showed that solar radiation could nick and break the backbone of isolated pUC19 plasmid. This year, I exposed pUC18 under a UV hood both in live Escherichia coli and as an isolated plasmid in order to begin to understand the effects on a live organism. The E. coli were killed rapidly although a few cells survived to 60 minutes. I also isolated plasmid DNA from exposed cells. Gel electrophoresis revealed that nicking of the DNA increased with exposure time in vivo and in vitro, but the in vivo DNA had less damage then the in vitro DNA. As exposure time increased, less DNA was extracted probably due to further breakage of the DNA backbone. I conclude that nicking directly correlates to the viability of the cells. Any cells surviving at 60 minutes might have been self-shaded or possibly had survival mechanisms. Thus these results suggest that in studies of UV induced damage in nature, breakage of the DNA backbone could be a critical factor that needs to be researched.

CELL WALL FORMATION FROM MARINE DIATOM PROTOPLASTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR NOVEL TRANSFORMATION AND NANOTECHNOLOGY TECHNIQUES
Ronit Batya Roth Abramson
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

Biosilification, or the biological processes responsible for silica deposition, is of growing interest in many fields of study from marine biology to nanotechnology. Since diatoms can so readily make three-dimensional intricate structures that exceed current synthetic methods, investigation of diatom cell wall development offers applications in microengineering, photonics, and nanotechnology. Diatoms also have shown potential as a source of lipids for biodiesel. However, diatom research is impeded because access to the cellular DNA is obstructed by the silica cell wall. In this study, the marine apochloratic diatom Nitzschia alba was induced to grow without a cell wall using a silica-starved media, L+2%, consisting of 0.5% bacto-yeast extract, 1% bactotryptone, and 2% sodium chloride. Rapid agitation was necessary to induce frustule divergence. The resulting protoplasts were then harvested and transferred to an artificial seawater media with PDMPO, a silica fluorescence stain. The cell wall regeneration was observed for pattern and growth comparison after 24 and 48 hour time periods using an epifluorescence microscope. It was determined that viability was maintained through the protoplast procedure as evidenced by the complete regeneration of the cell wall with wild-type morphology through multiple generations. Further investigation is required to establish genes responsible for independent steps of cell wall formation but the implications suggest the potential for an alternative gene transformation technique and pave the way for further studies of diatom cell wall development.

RESTORATION OF MIR-200C: EFFECT ON HEY CANCER CELL BEHAVIOR
Connie Liu
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), previously thought to be “junk-DNA,” are now known to play a large role in gene regulation. In particular, miR-200c is highly expressed in normal cells but not in very aggressive breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer cells. To determine the effects of miRNA on cancer cells, miR-200c was added to aggressive ovarian cancer cells (HEY) to target specific messenger RNAs in the cell and alter its characteristics. Negative (HEY cells with a scrambled miRNA code) and mock (HEY cells without added nucleic acids) cells were used as controls.<br><br> <br><br>The effects of miR-200c on HEY cells were assessed with two assays. The wound healing assay determined how quickly HEY cells migrated when a “wound” was created in plates of monolayered cells. The clonogenic assay determined how well HEY cells responded to paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug, by quantifying surviving colonies. The miR-200c transfected cells were hypothesized to be less migratory and more sensitive to paclitaxel due to miR-200c’s presence in non-cancerous cells, and the results support this hypothesis. The “wound” for the pre-200c cells closed slower than the control cells, and 64% of pre-200c cells died when treated with 10 nM of paclitaxel, compared to 43.4% and 24% of negative and mock cells, respectively. However, with only five successful trials, definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Therefore, more experiments are currently being done. It is hoped that with more trials and a larger variety of assays, the miR-200c will be shown to cause HEY cells to behave more like normal cells.

IDENTIFICATION OF MOLECULAR BREAST CANCER SUBTYPES USING TISSUE MICROARRAYS AND DIGITAL MICROSCOPY
Arika D Verma
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

A wide histological range is found in invasive breast cancers (IBC) and many subtypes lack targets for therapy. This study aimed to compare predictive genomic biomarkers found in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBCs useful for determining tumor progression. Through the use of Automated Cellular Image Analysis, biomarker status was identified following immunohistochemical staining of four tissue microarray (TMA) whole slide images on 453 tissue cores from 149 patient tumor samples. Five predictive biomarkers were identified; estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and cytokeratin 5/6 (CK-5/6). From these protein expression results, hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed cancer subtype identities. IBC TMAs show various breast cancer subtype identities containing many of the same biomarkers found in DCIS type cancer. Statistical analyses were also performed comparing histological parameters associated with the prevalence of subtypes. The DCIS component of IBCs demonstrated the same immunophenotype as associated IBCs. Pure DCIS shows immunophenotypic heterogeneity and a relatively small proportion of HER-2/ER- and basal-like. Significant correlations provided by these analyses may lead to earlier detection of progressively invasive tumors and allow for timely aggressive treatment for these patients. Similarity in DCIS and IBC subtypes provide evidence for the DCIS as the precursor lesion.

ASSESSMENT OF RELATIVE TELOMERE LENGTH BETWEEN VARIOUS LINES OF HUMAN CANCER
Micah Kuuini Del Rosario
Kamehameha High School-Kapalama, Honolulu, HI

The purpose of this project was to measure the relative telomeric DNA length of various human cancer cell lines using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Measurement of relative telomere length was to be accomplished via RT-PCR by using primers specific to the human telomeric sequence of TTAGGG. By making proper, unavoidable assumptions and standardizing the initial mass of genomic DNA in a sample set containing various cell lines, the differences in the rate of accumulation of telomeric PCR product can be attributed to the lenght of the telomere in the cell; a larger telomere would create more target sites to which the primer can bind.<br><br> The results showed that at low and high masses of genomic DNA, the amount of telomeric template is either too little or too much to produce recognizable differences in the product accumulation rate. The data did show, however, that since the percentage of telomeric DNA in the genome is extremely small, relatively large amounts of genomic DNA are required for RT-PCR assessment. The final, presented RT-PCR run also shows that replicates of the same cell line retain similar accumulation rates of telomeric PCR product and that distinctions can be made between cell lines in product accumulation and, therefore, in relative telomere length. The feasibility of the procedure is demonstrated in the concluding results, but procedural fine-tuning is still required to get clearer, more conclusive data.

TREATMENT OF THIRD DEGREE BURNS USING TISSUE ENGINEERING GENERATION OF BIOARTIFICIAL SKIN IN 3D-CULTURE SYSTEM IN-VITRO
Amira Mostafa Badran
Dar el Tarbiah American School, Cairo, EGYPT

Tissue engineering research is applied to accomplish a new technology which makes medical treatments possible for diseases which have been difficult to cure by traditional methods. However; due to its expensive resources, it is not used in most countries. Tissue engineering usually involves cell culture of skin tissues, chitosan scaffold which is considered as a natural polymeric polysaccharide and media growth. In my project, I thought of a new idea to solve the financial problem by using a less expensive resource of scaffold, extracting chitosan from the peel of shrimps. This procedure was implemented by professional doctors with my assistance. The experiment done involved cell culture of mice skin tissue, which was seeded into the chitosan scaffold to initiate epithelial tissues in three-dimensional culture systems. The procedure depends on the ability to manipulate cell behavior in such a way as to produce three-dimensional skin tissues. This invention has attracted much attention as a new technology which tends to replace damaged tissues to overcome the drawbacks caused by using traditional methods in tissue transplantation and skin grafting, such as immune rejections or the presence of bacteria. Using a new source of chitosan, much cheaper than ones used nowadays, provides patients with the most efficient technique in tissue engineering with also a low cost. Applying this technique on human beings who were severely burnt after an accident that caused partial or full damage to a certain part of the skin, will avoid any sort of infection and also allow the skin tissues to build up on the human body again safely.

CHLOROPLAST ADVENTURE
I-Chia Liao
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

The purpose of this project includes: to see if the chloroplasts can survive independently from the plant cells and attempt to test the validity of Endosymbiotic Theory. Before the experiments, centrifuge was used to isolate the chloroplast. In experiment one, I putted the chloroplasts in a bottle with 20mL of cold isolation buffer, and recorded its CO2 concentration, temperature, and light intensity for at least 24 hours. I did a control with the same set up, except the chloroplast solution was replaced with fresh spinach leaves. In experiment two, I pasted the chloroplasts on the agar in three Petri dishes, placed them under indirect light, and took pictures every day for two days. In first trial of experiment one, the CO2 concentration does not decrease smoothly as expected, instead, the graph rises and drops greatly. I suspect there is bacteria influencing the result. In second trial, the CO2 concentration shows periodic negative slopes down the decline of the graph. It can mean the occurrence of photosynthesis, therefore chloroplast activity. In second experiment, the chloroplasts grow visibly after 24 hours and 48 hours. The contents in the Petri dishes tested to have similar color before and after the experiment, so it is chloroplast growth. It shows that they can really grow outside of the plant cell, and the Endosymbiotic Theory is true based on my experiments.

RACE FOR THE CURE: EFFECT OF HERCEPTIN AND HERCEPTIN-AURISTATIN IMMUNOCONJUGATES HC-AF AND HC-AE ON 231BR-HER2 BREAST CANCER CELLS
Manali Yavatkar, Sanjana Rao, 
Jesuit High School, Portland, OR

Breast cancer is a devastating disease and the HER2 (Human Epidermal growth Receptor 2)-over expressing tumors form 25-30% of breast cancer incidents. Herceptin® has been touted as a revolutionary treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. Herceptin® keeps the cells from proliferating by attaching itself to the cells and signaling the body’s immune system to destroy them. Research has shown that Herceptin® requires the immune system to be effective. The purpose of our project was to investigate Herceptin®’s unique role in killing the cells without help from other factors. The second goal of our project was to compare Herceptin® with an improved version of Herceptin®, Herceptin® -auristatin in the form of two immunoconjugates (HC-AE and HC-AF). Our research hypotheses were two fold. First, we hypothesized that the Herceptin® would have no effect on the cells in vitro because it relies on the immune system to kill the cells. Second, we postulated that the Herceptin® -auristatin immunoconjugates would be more effective than Herceptin® because they contain both Herceptin® and a cytotoxic drug. We also studied the relative potency of two immunoconjugates based on the storage interval. The tests involved plating the cells, adding drugs with different concentrations, and then assessing cell apoptosis using a WST assay. In contrast to the common belief that Herceptin relies on the immune system, we discovered that Herceptin, can destroy HER2+ cells in vitro. We also found that the Herceptin® was more effective in killing the cells in vitro than the Herceptin® -auristatin immunoconjugates.

A MICROARRAY BASED RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION SCREEN FOR NOVEL CELL ADHESION GENES IN CEREBELLAR BASKET AND STELLATE INTERNEURONS
Pragya Kakani, Aakash Abbi, 
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

Cerebellar basket and stellate interneurons regulate neural circuits involved in motor control. Insight regarding the molecular cues guiding basket and stellate cell action in circuit formation in the cerebellum is not widely available. The goal of this study is to identify genes specific to these cerebellar interneurons in comparison with their synaptic partner, the Purkinje cell. These genes will have relevance for the formation of major neural circuits by providing evidence for cell adhesion molecule (CAM) coding. <br><br> Genes with relevance for basket and stellate specificity and with domain sequences common to CAMs were isolated using microarray data analysis. PCR cycling followed by in vitro transcription was used to treat RNA primers to form probes. In situ hybridization was then performed revealing mRNA expression patterns in fixed saggital brain sections of Mus musculus aged 21 postnatal days (P21). A total of 9 critical genes with relevance for CAM coding were identified. By identifying novel genes as candidates for synapse formation, this study provides a critical foundation for research regarding the genetic basis for motor coordination and related neurological disorders.

EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESVERATROL ACTION AND TELOMERASE IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Edward Joseph Gillig, Hannah Olson, 
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

This study examined the relationship between resveratrol action and telomerase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Telomerase is an enzyme that synthesizes telomeres, which are short DNA repeats that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomerase is inactivated in normal somatic cells, which is associated with replicative senescence and cell death. Resveratrol is a popular health supplement that is associated with anti-aging and anti-cancer properties. The goal of our experiment was to see if resveratrol exerted its effects via telomerase. In order to assess this question, we compared the replicative life span of wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae to that of the EST2 mutant that lacks the enzyme telomerase, each grown with and without resveratrol. Replicative life span was determined by conducting viability tests on culture growth over 12 days. Our studies showed that resveratrol extended the replicative life span of normal S. cerevisiae cells, but did not show any effect on the cells which lacked the telomerase enzyme. These results suggest that resveratrol exerts its effects at least in part though the action of telomerase. Further studies examining the interplay of resveratrol and telomerase may have relevance to cancer cells, which exhibit reactivation of telomerase associated with immortality.

ENERGY = MITOCHONDRIA²
Witney Chen, Diane Chen, 
North Quincy High School, Quincy, MA

In society today, natural sugars are constantly being replaced by artificial sweeteners as supposedly healthier alternatives, but the synthetic variety does not guarantee energy. <br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to compare artificial and natural sweeteners’ abilities to induce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in Dypsis lutescens endosperm mitochondria. It was hypothesized that natural sweeteners would prevail in making the most energy in the form of ATP. To do this, fresh endosperm cells were first retrieved from the palm seeds. <br><br> Different solutions of both artificial (sucralose and saccharin) and natural (sucrose) sweeteners were added to the cells, with the presence of Janus Green B, a dye that targets active mitochondria. The mitochondria were isolated from the cells and examined spectrophotometrically using a 395 nm wavelength. Since the dye marked active mitochondria, where ATP production occurred, greater ATP production would be indicated by greater absorbance. <br><br> Results showed that natural sucrose had the highest absorbance, with a steep decline to sucralose and saccharin absorbance values. Therefore, the two artificial varieties performed poorly in generating ATP energy as compared to natural sugar, based on observed absorbance values. Thus, consumers should be aware of the inability of artificial sweeteners to produce energy in comparable quantities to natural sugars.

ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS ON DUGESIA TIGRINA
Lauren Elizabeth Costa, Michael Taberski, 
Somerset High School, Somerset, MA

The objective of this project was to determine whether electromagnetism could have negative effects on Dugesia tigrina. It was hypothesized that increasing electromagnetism would negatively affect regeneration time, spontaneous regeneration, and the general morphology of the planaria. They were separated into three distinct categories: the controlled in an environment with no magnets, others exposed to two neodynium magnets, and the last exposed to four neodynium magnets, creating varying magnetic fields. Over the course of 13 days, an exposed planaria would be cut using a scalpel, then set aside into a separate environment where observations were made daily and recorded using a digital microscope.<br><br> Several instances showed that electromagnetism altered the outcome of the development of individual planaria. Such differences included the regeneration time, individual abnormalities, and spontaneous regeneration. More abnormalities were observed in the planaria exposed to larger amounts of electromagnetism. To further prove the hypothesis, the planaria were exposed to a stronger “cow magnet.” This created the possibility that electromagnetism could increase mitosis in the planaria, which would explain the abnormalities and faster regeneration time. In one instance an individual planaria completely disintegrated after forming a white bulge resembling a tumor. More examples of recorded abnormalities appeared in the higher magnetic field.<br><br> The next part of this experiment uses Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis to analyze differences in the protein composition of the normal planaria compared to the planaria subjected to electromagnetic fields. Further evidence will be collected to make a connection between electromagnetic fields and abnormal mitosis during regeneration.

THE EFFECT OF THE STRESS HORMONE CORTISOL ON CANCER CELL REPRODUCTION RATE
Benjamin Tyler Cobb, Conor Moran, 
Chantilly High School, Chantilly

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of the stress hormone cortisol on mouse L929 cancer cell reproduction. Because cortisol is known to decrease reproduction of normal cells we thought it might have the same effect in cancer cells. We used mouse fibroblast L929 cells because they are known to contain cortisol receptors. The concentrations we used were normal level (72 ng/mL), 0, 2x, 4x. We used sterile technique to place the cells into flasks after counting them using a hemocytometer. After cells attached to the culture flask, we prepared the cortisol solution and treated the cells with it. After 24 hours of incubation with cortisol, we took the cells out and counted them. We counted detached cells (mitotic), as well as attached cells (cells in interphase). Our data showed that normal amounts of cortisol had the greatest effect, increasing cell reproduction. 0 and 2x also increased cell reproduction, but very slightly. The concentration four times the normal level lead to cell death.<br><br> From this data we can conclude that our hypothesis was correct. This finding is important because we can eliminate one of the possible hypotheses about how stress acts to decrease survival rate in cancer patients. It is also important because anyone who takes extra cortisol (ex: inhalers, prednisone) would not have to worry about that extra amount increasing possible tumor size.

MICRORNAS: A POSSIBLE TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE CANCER
Fatma Tanis, Rebecca Abrams, 
Harmony Science Academy, Houston, TX

MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs which regulate gene expression by Messenger RNA (mRNA) cleavage or repression. Because prostate cancer is characterized by gene over expression in the prostate gland, microRNAs are a possible treatment for this cancer. <br><br>The purpose of this study is to use bioinformatics (a field of science in which computational tools and statistics are used to analyze biological information) to determine if changing the 9th nucleotide from a U to a G would increase stability and therefore enhance gene repression through mRNA cleavage. By applying this research to the genes this research can expectantly be used as a treatment for prostate cancer. If applied, the outcome of this research can expectantly be used as a treatment for prostate cancer.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the editing of the 9th base pair nucleotide would improve the binding of the microRNA to the mRNA. This 9th base pair nucleotide change could help provide a better treatment for prostate cancer by increasing the chances of cleaving the mRNA. <br><br>A list of let-7a genes was obtained from a journal article. From this list the 9th base pair position of all genes were characterized. Images of MicroRNA binding to mRNA were acquired and the 9th base pair was looked at before and after edition. It was also determined whether the 9th base nucleotide was paired or unpaired to the mRNA. From the list and the papers studied, it was discovered that HMGA2 is a gene over expressed in prostate cancer and has seven target sites. Once HMGA2 was identified as an over expressed gene in prostate cancer, the list of genes and the Minimum Free Energy numbers (MFE) were used to identify the effect of base pair change on the binding and consequently the cleaving or repressing of the microRNA to the mRNA. <br><br>In conclusion, the hypothesis was correct; the editing of the 9th base pair improved the binding of the microRNAs to the mRNAs by 70%. It was also found that HMGA2 is over expressed in prostate cancer and has seven target sites, meaning that the possibility of good binding is strong. In addition, three of the seven target sites improved, all adding up to a high possibility of cleavage. The results suggest that this procedure can be used as a viable treatment for prostate cancer.

THE EFFECT OF THE METABOLIC INHIBITORS 2-DEOXYGLUCOSE AND DHEA ON GLUCOSE INTAKE AND LACTATE SECRETION IN A549 HUMAN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS
Monali Gautam Haldankar, Anna Duan, 
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Cancer is an increasingly prevalent disease. Cellular metabolism inhibitors need to be discovered in hopes of halting cell growth, as well as promoting cell death. If the inhibitors are successful in promoting cell arrest they can be used in further studies to determine legitimacy as ingredients in drugs. This project will determine the effect of the metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose and DHEA on glucose intake and lactate secretion in A549 cells. It was hypothesized that 2-DG will most efficiently halt cell growth. 2-DG cuts off glycolysis at the first step, completely halting cellular respiration therefore, theoretically, 2-DG will exhibit greater cell arrest. The cells were plated and effective concentrations of inhibitors needed to cause 50% cell arrest or death (IC50) in A549 cells were determined to be 5 mM for 2-DG and 2.5 mM for DHEA. The A549 cells were cultured with inhibitors at IC50. The glucose consumption and lactate production were measured in triplicates. The MTT assay was used to observe effects on mitochondrial activity through absorbency. Glucose and lactate assay kits were used to measure glucose consumption and lactate production respectively. 2-DG as well as DHEA both had significant effects on lactate output but minimal effect on glucose intake, 2-DG more so than DHEA. Since 2-DG had a substantial effect on lactate secretion (and therefore glycolysis) in cancer cells, more cell arrest occurred. 2-DG can be looked further into as a combination therapy treatment course for cancer.

THE PARADOX OF IMMORTALITY: CORRELATING LONGEVITY WITH A TELOMERASE GENE VARIANT (SNP 2853672)
Londyn Rayne Cullifer
The Arkansas School of Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Telomeres are TG-rich sequences in humans, (T2AG3)n, repeated as many as 2500 times protecting the ends of chromosomes from degradation. Although telomeres become shorter after each cell division and may even result in apoptosis (programmed cell death) if they become too short, their starting length has been shown to be a heritable factor. The purpose of this experiment was to analyze if there is a correlation between a telomerase (hTERT, a ribozyme that extend telomeres) genetic variant, rs2853672, and reduced or increased average longevity in families. Although telomerase activity is critical for appropriate development and aging, when telomerases becomes overly active, they can increase cancer rates. Down regulation of telomerase in tumor cells has been shown to kill them; however, an inhibited telomerase can prevent regeneration, thus, the caveat to longevity. In this study, participants’ DNA samples were isolated, amplified using PCR, and cut by a restriction enzyme, SfaN1, so that a polymorphism in the telomerase gene could be analyzed using gel electrophoresis (C/C = 441 bp, A/C = 441 bp, 252 bp, and 189 bp, A/A = 252 bp and 189 bp). A 2-sample t test supported the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the genetic variant and longevity. Further study of telomerase activity should yield insight into cancer treatment and tissue regeneration.

CARBOXY-TERMINAL MODULATOR PROTEIN IN ADIPOCYTES
Elly Kathryn Bringaze
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the presence of Carboxy-terminal modulator protein (CTMP) throughout the differentiation process of 3T3-L1 cells in connection with Type 2 Diabetes and insulin resistance and also in comparison to Adiponectin and STAT 5A. It was hypothesized that CTMP would be present in the earliest stages of the differentiation process. An electrophoresis evaluation was conducted along with Western Blotting. The results corroborated the hypothesis that CTMP is not present in the significantly differentiated stages of normal, healthy adipocytes. Because CTMP is negative regulator of Akt/PKB, a crucial protein in insulin sensitivity, the results suggest that excessive amounts of CTMP could potentially lead to insulin resistance in adipocytes. The results for Adiponectin confirmed that the cells used were indeed healthy and normal. These results suggest very much about the processes of insulin’s transport of glucose into adipose cells and indicate a great deal about CTMP’s role in the signal transduction cascade that allows insulin to work properly in adipocytes.

FEEDING STUDIES AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENT ANALYSIS OF FEEDING CIRCUIT IN LEAN SYNDECAN-3 NULL MICE
Diana Basali
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Effective management of obesity has become an important clinical focus because the disease is an epidemic in western society. The research focuses on a neuronal circuit in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates feeding and body weight. One of the critical neuronal circuits is comprised of appetite and satiety neurons that constantly balance each other. A key component in balancing the wiring of this circuit is syndecan-3 protein. These studies were designed to determine whether less opposition by appetite neurons in the circuit of the syndecan-3 deficient mice cause increased satiety and leaner body mass. Both an experimental group of Syndecan-3 null mice and a control group of Wild type mice were used.To observe this data in neuronal signaling, brain sections from the hypothalamus region from wild type and syndecan-3 deficient mice were prepared for immunofluorescence staining using MTII, AgRP, and Ghrelin.The increased activation of MTII responsive neurons in the hypothalamus of Syndecan-3 null mice is consistent with the previous studies in the lab that revealed greater inhibition of food intake in the syndecan-3 null mice. Previous studies also indicate that when injected with the appetite stimulus, AgRP, the syndecan-3 null mice experienced less of an orexigenic response than the wild-type mice. Similarly, immunopositive neurons were detected in close apposition with AgRP in wild type, but not sydecan-3 deficient mice. Therefore, the previous information on feeding studies were consistent with my immunofluorescence analysis of the hypothalamic circuit. Future research will focus more on feeding studies and immunofluorescene analysis using ghrelin, a hormone that triggers a signal leading to increased feeding. Ultimately, these studies may lead to therapeutic approaches to help combat obesity.

EGCG MITIGATES PARKINSON’S DISEASE-ASSOCIATED MUTANT LRRK2-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY VIA PROTEIN TRANSLATION MODULATION
Jingjie Cheng
Raffles Girls' School (Secondary), Singapore, SINGAPORE

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterised by a selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons that is presently without a cure. While the majority of PD cases are sporadic, a number of genetic mutations associated with familial PD onset exist, of which mutations in the LRRK2 gene are most prevalent. Recent studies suggest that mutant LRRK2 posses increased kinase activity, resulting in the deregulation of protein translation via the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP, a key regulator of the process. Deregulation of protein translation is detrimental to stressed cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of the antioxidant EGCG on LRRK2 G2019S mutant-induced 4E-BP hyperphosphorylation in cultured cells, and used the Drosophila model to investigate the neuroprotective effects of EGCG. We observed that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation increased 4E-BP phosphorylation in vitro and importantly, that EGCG treatment leads to a reduction in 4E-BP phosphorylation. We then treated LRRK2 mutant flies, which display PD-associated locomotion deficiency and DA neuronal loss, with EGCG. Interestingly, we found that EGCG clearly restored locomotion and rescued DA neuronal loss in these flies. Notably, DA neuronal rescue was especially striking in the PAM cluster of the fly brain. We also tested the effects of related polyphenols such as CGA in our cell and fly models of LRRK2 dysfunction. In essence, our study highlights the potential of EGCG and possibly other polyphenols such as CGA as therapeutic compounds against PD.

HPV ONCOGENE E6 TARGET HISTONE ACETYL TRANSFERASES IN CANCER CELLS
Arun Brendan Dutta
Western Albemarle High School, Crozet, VA

Human papillomavirus causes cancers of the cervix and oral cavity. HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 drive cells into uncontrolled proliferation and invasion by inhibiting tumor suppressor cellular genes like p53 and Rb and Tip60. My project explores how HPV uses E6 to take over a cell.<br><br> I knocked down E6 in cervical cancer cells with siRNA and looked for a change in the levels of HBO1 and MOF, both Tip60-related molecules. The Western results showed that HPV-E6 does not inhibit HBO1 or MOF. I next tested whether E6 affects Tip60 in oral cancer cells that are infected with HPV. Addition of MG132, an inhibitor of the pathway used by E6 to degrade Tip60, increases the level of Tip60 in oral cancer cells. This suggests that E6 in oral cancer cells degrades Tip60.<br><br> Tip60 is known to act at the promoters for several cellular genes. I thus tested whether E6 regulates the expression of genes that are normally regulated by TIP60. Quantitative-Real-Time PCR showed that the ATF4 gene, which encodes a transcription factor that affects angiogenesis, is itself repressed by Tip60 and stimulated by E6, as would be expected if E6 inhibits Tip60. I next identified hundreds of other promoters regulated by Tip60 and E6. The results suggest that the HPV oncogene E6 makes cells cancerous by changing the expression of many genes that are regulated by Tip60 and will open the way for new ways of inhibiting cancers caused by HPV.

A NOVEL REGULATORY MECHANISM IN CANCER-LINKED CELL SIGNALING
Hannah Taylor Stuart
The King's School, Canterbury, Canterbury, Kent, UNITED KINGDOM

The aim of this project was to determine whether the signaling enzyme p38alpha MAP kinase binds to the PX domains of three other signaling enzymes, SNX27, p40phox and p47phox, with the hope of identifying a novel mechanism by which p38 defends the human body from cancer. <br><br> <br><br>p38 is activated by carcinogenic stress, and induces cell death so that tumour formation is prevented. Errors in p38 activity can lead to cancer. The PX domain is a conserved regulatory region found in 45 different signaling proteins, including PLD1, SNX27, p40 and p47. p38 is known to bind to the PX domain of PLD1, so it was hypothesised that p38 does bind to the PX domains of SNX27, p40 and p47.<br><br> <br><br>E. coli were genetically engineered to produce human p38 and the three PX domains. After extraction and purification of these proteins from the E. coli, binding assays were conducted and then analysed by Western blotting. The results obtained conclusively showed that p38 can bind to each of the PX domains. <br><br> <br><br>This suggests p38 can regulate a number of widely varied cellular processes simultaneously, by binding to and thus regulating the corresponding PX domain-containing signaling enzymes. Therefore, it is probable that p38 produces a coordinated response to carcinogenic stress on a much larger scale than previously thought. <br><br> <br><br>Detailed study of the p38 signaling network is key to understanding the cause and development of cancer, and consequently how best to treat and cure it. This network is a potential therapeutic target.

THE ROLE OF CTF18 IN THE PROMOTION OF CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION IN CANCER CELLS
Emma Elisabeth Sperry
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

Ctf18 is a protein in one type of Replication Factor C complex (RFC). Ctf18-RFC is a Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) clamp loader which is thought to be partially responsible for Sister Chromatid Cohesion (SCC, a process which occurs simultaneously with DNA replication). Clamps enable DNA polymerases to be more processive and thus more efficient at DNA replication. If Ctf18 is not available, Ctf18-RFC does not form and proper cell division fails. The purpose of this experiment was to examine Ctf18's function in the condensation of chromosomes during early mitosis. It was predicted that depletion of Ctf18 would yield structural defects in chromosomes along with incomplete chromosome condensation.<br><br>Two experimental techniques, the western blot and the metaphase spread, were used to demonstrate Ctf18’s role in SCC. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells were transfected with siRNA to knockdown Ctf18. Western blot analysis allowed for the detection of Ctf18 in vitro after cells had been digested. Metaphase spreads allowed the direct visualization of DAPI-stained chromosomes under 1000X fluorescence magnification. The number of cell chromosome defects was counted and a binomial distribution was used to quantify the effect of Ctf18 depletion on chromosome “health.” <br><br>It was determined that kinetochore and arm cohesion defects were present in significant amounts in transfected cells. These results indicate that upon depletion of Ctf18, chromosome condensation fails, causing incomplete chromosome congression to the metaphase plate during mitosis. Therefore, these experiments help to indicate the vital role that Ctf18 plays in SCC.

CERAMIDE-ENRICHED DOMAINS IN MIXED LIPID BILAYERS: UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY BEHIND DEMYELINATION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS)
Pranali Hemant Dalvi
International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

400,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis (MS) - with 200 more people diagnosed every week. MS results from the deterioration of the myelin sheath (demyelination), a protective envelope that facilitates nerve impulse transmission. Unfortunately, the biochemical processes behind demyelination are poorly understood. The major scientific theories concerning the etiology of MS include the following perspectives: immunologic, environmental, infectious, and genetic. In this study, the etiology of MS was studied on a molecular level from a biophysical perspective: a Molecular Dynamics simulation in the computational modeling program Groningen Machine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS). This simulation specifically focused on the sphingomyelin-ceramide mixed lipid bilayer system since the myelin sheath is comprised of 80% sphingomyelin. The heterogeneous sphingomyelin-ceramide bilayer is prevalent in most mammalian cells, but the body of knowledge of sphingomyelin-ceramide interactions is limited. The simulation consisted of 40,000 atoms, 200 lipids, and 10,000 water molecules at 323 K, 340 K, and 358 K. The lipid bilayer was enriched with increasing concentrations of ceramide to understand how ceramide domains affect the behavior of the system. According to the results, the accumulation of ceramide and subsequent ceramide-sphingomyelin interactions prompt “phase transitions” and decreased average chain order parameters. Thus, the product is a brittle myelin sheath prone to cracking, termed demyelination. Essentially, this study’s atomistic model of lipid bilayer interactions will serve as a precursor to experimental methods of combating MS, such as gene therapy. This simulation will empower the scientific community to assuage symptoms of MS and thus of neurodegeneration.

IDENTIFICATION OF A NEW LINK IN GENE SILENCING: ACETYLATION OF THE METHYL BINDING PROTEIN MECP2
Stephanie Michelle Axelson
Airline High School, Bossier City, LA

Numerous tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) causing apoptosis, sensitivity to antigrowth signals, genome stability, and limited replicative potential are silenced in virtually all types of cancers. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyl binding domain proteins (MBDs) play key roles in the silencing of these TSGs. The HDAC SIRT1 and the MBD MeCP2 have been shown to bind together, suggesting their collaboration in the transcriptional repression of hypermethylated genes. This study investigates the acetylation of MeCP2, as lysine acetylation may be a novel regulator of MeCP2 function. MeCP2 was over-expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells treated with several histone/protein deacetylase inhibitors. Acetylated lysine was immunoprecipitated to blot for MeCP2. These western blots were the first ever evidence proving the acetylation of MeCP2. Next, human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were treated with a SIRT1 inhibitor and Polymerase Chain Reactions were conducted to detect changes in gene expression of genes regulated by MeCP2. IL-6 and Mac25—MeCP2 target genes—were activated thereby supporting the MeCP2/SIRT1 collaboration.

GENE DOSAGE AND EXPRESSION IN HUMAN LYMPHOBLASTOID CELL LINES
Nolan Mint Kiyoshi Kamitaki
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

Many human genes are thought to vary in copy number from individual to individual, but the relationship between the copy number (dosage) of a gene and its expression level is not yet understood. Copy number variants (CNVs) can be used to investigate this relationship, as they contribute significantly to genetic variation between humans and potentially to differences in gene expression. By combining data sets on gene expression levels and CNVs from the same individuals, and gene sequence locations, I investigated the relationship between copy number and expression level of genes located within CNVs. This was done in the statistical environment, R, through integrating the publicly available annotated human genome sequence, recently developed CNV location dataset, and HapMap project of 270 individuals. 101 genes that reside within common CNVs were identified, of which 33 genes were determined to be actively expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines. For approximately half (16/33) of these genes, gene dosage was significantly (p ≤ 0.01) correlated with mRNA expression level. Examining the associations of these particular genes has the potential to reveal entirely new links between CNVs and important phenotypic differences. Expression levels of the remaining 17 actively expressed genes were uncorrelated with their copy number; such genes present new biological models for exploring how cellular and evolutionary systems respond to perturbations in gene dosage.

EXOSOMES AS VECTORS: A COMPARISON OF NONVIRAL TRANSFECTION METHODS
William Douglas Meadow
Ponte Vedra High School, Ponte Vedra, FL

The purpose of this research into biological engineering was to investigate exosomes, 50-200nm intercellular vesicles arising from the intralumenal vesicles of a multivesicular body upon plasma membrane fusion, as a novel vectors for DNA delivery. Because cells that contain cytosolic nucleic acid and protein can incorporate this cargo into their exosomes to be released into the extracellular space, the process of exosomal transfer of biomolecules is essentially self-iterating. In the end, my central hypothesis was that if I compared the DNA content of exosomes from transfected and untransfected CHO cells, then the exosomes from the untransfected cells would contain no DNA while the exosomes from the transfected cells would contain signficant amounts of DNA. I cultured flasks of CHO cells for usage in my experiments and isolated their exosomes by means of calcium ionophore to stimulate exosome release and centrifugation to isolate the exosomes. I also lipofected a flask of CHO cells with plasmid by means of Lipofectamine 2000 CD after precisely calculating the DNA concentration of a sample of the plasmid via spectrophotometry. Unexpectedy, the exosome supernatant sample from even the control group of untransfected cells tested positive for the presence of DNA by spectrophotometry. This led me to the conclusion that exosomes have the potential to serve as novel vectors for the transmission of DNA from cell to cell. In the future, this may lead to the establishment of exosomes as a welcome alternative to traditional methods of DNA transfer.

DIFFERENTIATION OF MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS INTO NEURAL TISSUES
Anastasiya Dykyy
Trondheim Katedralskole, Trondheim, Sor-Trondelag, NORWAY

This project deals with the comparative study of neural tissues obtained from two different lines of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (MESC). MESC are cells which can differentiate into each cell of the mouse body. Even if they are very promising for medicine, the differentiation process in-vitro is hard to control and predict and many details on the behaviour of these cells are still unknown. In recent years, the differentiation of stem cells in medium has been extensively studied and many protocols have been determined to differentiate the stem cells into the desired somatic cells. <br><br>The novelty of this project was to use a protocol, developed for the differentiation of MESC in medium, to differentiate two lines of MESC (D3 and CGR8) into neural tissues and to comparatively analyse their cellular composition. <br><br>Different techniques were used through the study: mammalian embryonic stem cell cultivation and harvesting, immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescent microscopy. The experiments, performed with both cell lines at identical conditions, unambiguously evidence that D3 cells differentiate into different kinds of neural cells (neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) forming a healthy neural tissue. On the other hand, CGR8 cells differentiate into different cell types, neural and not, giving rise to a heterogeneous, unhealthy tissue. A further development of this research would be to use neural tissues obtained from D3 cells in drugs testing instead of using animals for this purpose.

TRANSDIFFERENTIATION: A GATEWAY TO DIABETES TREATMENT
Laurel Rose Bingman
The Woodlands College Park High School, Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

This study focused on Type 1 diabetes, a disease in which the pancreas no longer produces insulin. Because the liver is similar to the pancreas in function, it is conceivable that liver cells can be converted into pancreas cells through transdifferentiation, providing a possible treatment option. This process may be induced by the introduction of a gene for a transcription factor, pdx1, via adenovirus infection. The transcription of the pdx1 gene may prompt more pancreas genes to be expressed, such as NK6 Homeobox1 (nkx6-1), insulin, and somatostatin genes while lowering the expression of liver genes, such as apolipoprotein A1 (apoa1). The problem of the experiment is: Can a liver cell be transdifferentiated into a pancreas cell, and if so, which genes will increase and decrease in expression? The hypothesis is: In cells infected with pdx1, the pdx1 and nkx6-1 genes will be highly expressed on Day 1, while the insulin and somatostatin genes will be highly expressed by Day 7, and apoa1 gene expression will decrease. <br><br> To perform the experiment, first an adenovirus was used to infect the cells with the gene pdx1 or control DNA. Then, after 1 and 7 days, mRNA was purified from the cells, and qPCR was used to measure the levels of expression of target genes. In cells infected with pdx1, a trend was found of higher expression of pdx1 for day 1 and day 7, there was a trend on day 1 of greater expression of somatostatin, and apoa1 expression decreased over time. The levels of expression for the nkx6-1 and insulin genes were immeasurable. Future research could enable improved control of gene expression, setting the stage for future transdifferentiation gene therapy for diabetes.

RAPID QUANTIFICATION OF SALICYLIC ACID (VIA BIOSENSOR) IN NPR1 BACKGROUND ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA ETHYL METHANESULFONATE MUTANTS
Deepak Sathyanarayan
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, FL

Immune reactions are induced when a pathogen enters a host organism to track-down and prevent further infection of the organism. In many plants, the immune system is triggered by the production of Salicylic Acid (SA). The gene named npr1 found in Arabidopsis thaliana codes for a SA tolerance protein, NPR1. With npr1 present, the plant expresses increased disease defenses and decreased levels of SA accumulation. With npr1 mutated, the immune response is suppressed, SA accumulation increases, and SA becomes toxic. The purpose of this experiment is to systematically isolate/analyze npr1 mutated Arabidopsis thaliana plants with low SA production levels after exposure to the Pseudomonas syringae pathogen. Using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), Arabidopsis thaliana seeds are randomly mutated (nucleotide substitution)… hypothetically leading to the restoration of SA tolerance, as well as an improved immune response after pathogen exposure. The SA levels in pathogen-exposed plants were measured via biosensor, Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH-lux. By using these techniques, the phenotype of low SA accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana has been restored through a various set of gene mutations, and plants expressing this have been successfully isolated. From these low-SA plants, the specific gene mutation responsible for the lowered SA levels will be identified through a series of primers and gene mapping. Once found, the mutation can be applicable to other organisms/plants, thus preventing future plant death due to the npr1 mutation. This leads to crops with lower susceptibility to disease and pathogens. Decreased crop failure rates equal to an overall greater productivity rate of global agriculture.

PRE-INITIATION COMPLEXES OF SREBP-1A AND -2: MEDIATOR-DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF FATTY ACID AND CHOLESTEROL METABOLISM
Radhika Rawat
Boulder High School, Boulder, CO

The human Mediator complex, a 1.2 MDa, 26-subunit protein assembly, is essential in the transcription of all protein-coding genes. Proteins known as activators bind specific sites within the genome to help regulate expression of specific subsets of genes. Activator binding triggers major structural shifts in Mediator, suggesting a means to regulate transcription: Mediator’s ability to recruit different cofactors by exposing different surfaces within the complex. This structural shift induces the formation of a Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) including RNA Polymerase II and other cofactors that must assemble for transcription initiation. I explored the potential gene-specificity of the PIC by examining the protein compositions of the PICs of the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) isoforms -1a and -2, regulators of fatty acid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. Via affinity purification, I identified an enrichment of the P-TEFb (Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b) complex and other factors in only the SREBP-2-Mediator purification, suggesting distinct mechanisms of regulation of fatty acid metabolism genes (SREBP-1a) versus cholesterol synthesis genes (SREBP-2). Upon functional validation, these results may provide insight into potential gene-specific mechanisms of regulation, possibly laying the foundation for developments in pharmacogenomics, if paired with further understanding of Mediator’s role in regulating the transcription machinery.

NEURONS AND GLIA EXHIBIT DIFFERENT ADHESION COMPLEXES IN THE EMBRYONIC CHICKEN RETINA: R-COGNIN-MEDIATED AGGREGATION AND INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION
Ryohei Ozaki
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington, NY

Intercellular communication is integral to the differentiation of cells and formation of tissues in the developing embryo. Cell-cell adhesion, which creates direct contact points between individual cells, facilitates such interactions. R-cognin, a 50kDa-glycoprotein found on the cell membranes of embryonic chick retina neurons, has been shown to enhance aggregation and adhesion within the chick retina. Cognin is a relative of protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) found normally in the endoplasmic reticulum. The lack of KDEL, a retention motif of four amino acids (lys-asp-glu-leu), localizes the protein at the cell surface. Because the retina is a complex tissue comprised of various different cell types, cognin’s effect on non-neuronal cells is largely unknown. Glial cells, which make up 90% of the central nervous system (CNS), were, until recently, regarded as simple support cells for the neurons and thus overlooked. By studying the effects, or lack thereof, of cognin on glia, a facet of their intercellular interaction can be elucidated. This project investigated the fundamental differences in cell-adhesion complexes between the retina neurons and glial cells. The results demonstrate that while cognin and/or its receptor is found in the retina neurons, it is absent in the glial cells. Glial-cell adhesion is mediated by alternate, still undefined processes. The stem cell-like activity that specific types of glia are known to exhibit was also investigated. In a re-aggregation assay that simulates disparate cells adhering to each other in vitro, glia were found not to exhibit stem cell-like behavior. However, more research must be conducted in order to support this tentative conclusion.

COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN FUNCTION OF ALZHEIMER PROTEINS
Sanjana Thota
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of this Research Project is to identify the functions of some proteins associated with Alzheimer by looking at the similarity of the Protein and mRNA sequences of the protein in Humans and several other species. On doing so it was possible to identify the Major Protein Domain present in the region of most similarity amongst the sequences. The data for this project was obtained from OMIM Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database as well as the NCBI database. Using the protein sequence and the mRNA sequence the Major Protein Domains were recognized in five proteins : Amyloid Beta, Apolipoprotein E, Nitric Oxide Synthase 3, Microtubule-associated protein tau, and Alpha-2-macroglobulin.

VULVAR CANCER: IS HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS THE ETIOLOGICAL FACTOR?
Liane Dupont
Alssund High School, Sonderborg, DENMARK

Approximately 440 million people worldwide are genitally infected with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) – a DNA-virus, which due to the two oncogenes E6 and E7 can cause severe cancers, e.g. cervical cancer. The aim of this project is to examine the possible role of HPV in the etiology of another genital cancer, vulvar cancer, on the cellular level.<br><br>For this purpose, slices from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed vulvar tissue were analyzed using an antibody-based immunohistochemical method. The expression of HPV capsid protein L1 in 22 premalignant lesions (VIN-I/II) was examined by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled technique. Furthermore, the expression of the activated HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins in 24 manifest vulvar cancers was examined by a fluorescence-labeled technique.<br><br>Hereby, three different groups of vulvar cancers were identified:<br><br>1. HPV-induced vulvar cancers (50,0%) in which both HPV oncoproteins were expressed. HPV might be the only etiological factor.<br><br>2. HPV-correlated vulvar cancers (37,5%) in which only one of the HPV oncoproteins was expressed. HPV might be an important etiological factor, but together with other synergistic factors.<br><br>3. HPV-independent vulvar cancers (12,5%) in which no HPV oncoproteins were expressed. The entire etiology is due to other factors than HPV.<br><br>The next step will be to further examine the transformation process from HPV-infection over a premalignant lesion to manifest vulvar cancer as well as identifying the synergistic factors interacting with the HPV oncogenes. There is no doubt that an understanding of the transformation process on a cellular level will provide the key to future treatment and prevention of vulvar cancers.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIRNA DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR ONCOGENE SUPPRESSION IN HUMAN CANCERS
Jason Michael Littman
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

An array of disease etiologies and pathologies has been coupled with the overexpression of specific proteins; multiple cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and organ malfunctions. By manipulating the post-transcriptional errors that cause overexpression, through gene silencing, disease pathologies related to protein overexpression can be suppressed or even reversed. siRNA is a novel gene silencing particle whose silencing potential is limited by its delivery system.<br><br>The velocity of metastasis affected by IQGAP2 protein, a cellular adhesion and signaling protein, toward both Hepatocellular and Renal Cellular Carcinoma cell lines was determined using liposome siRNA transfection procedures and invasion assays. IQGAP2 was established as a metastatic protein, and potential oncogene, due to its direct relationship with invasion, prospectively declaring IQGAP2 silencing as a promising treatment for both Hepatocellular and Renal Cellular Carcinoma.<br><br>This procedure clarified the need for an efficient in vitro siRNA delivery system that possesses cell type targeting specificity and can be applied to in vivo experimentation. Three different siRNA delivery systems, liposome, peptide nanoparticle and adenoviral-plasmid linking systems, were studied and using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis. A Peptide Nanoparticle Transfection System was optimized and determined to be the most favorable transfection system because of its silencing aptitude and potential for targeting specificity. There is great potential in the Peptide Nanoparticle Transfection System due to its gene silencing ability associated with siRNA. This system can be adapted to target protein receptors, in various cell types, to maximize specificity and silencing capacity.

CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF MRP1-RNAI IN ARABIDOPSIS PLANTS
Victoria Breanna Dawson
Pine Bluff High School, Pine Bluff, AR

Plants are susceptible and exposed to exogenous toxins. In order to survive from these toxic chemicals, it needs detoxification of these agents. Arabidopsis genome contains 15 MRP (multidrug resistance associated protein) like genes and these MRP genes may play a role in the transport of mycotoxins and heavy metal resistance out of the cells. RNA interference (RNAi) has an important role in defending cells against viruses and also in directing development as well as gene expression. MRP1 RNAi expression was studied in Arabidopsis to check their role in detoxification of heavy metals and mycotoxins. The MRP1-RNAi gene was isolated by using gene specific primers and subsequently transformed into Arabidopsis plants. The transformed T0 seeds from an Arabidopsis plant were collected and selected on a selection medium containing spectinomycin. The T1 seeds were used to check for heavy metal resistance by determining if the gene helped the Arabidopsis seeds to still grow normally in three selection medium’s, each containing mercury, lead, and cadmium. MRP1-RNAi gene was successfully isolated and cloned into binary vector (pK7GWIWG2 (I). It was transformed into Arabidopsis using floral-dip method. The transformed seeds were collected and selected on the selection medium. The T1 generation seeds showed growth in selection medium’s containing heavy metals.

A GENETIC INVESTIGATION OF AUTISM: THE ROLE OF TYPE III NEUREGULIN-1/ERBB4 SIGNALING AND CONTACTIN4 EXPRESSION IN NEURODEVELOPMENT
Alexis Eleni Tchaconas
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Autism is a neurological disorder that has increased markedly in the past two years. Research has suggested that the causes of autism are primarily genetic, as certain genes predispose a person to the disorder. Contactin4 (CNTN4) is an autism candidate gene that regulates the formation of neuronal networks. This investigation targets the functions of CNTN4 by comparing it to a gene of known neurological pathways. <br><br>Type III Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene that signals with the protein ErbB4. Back signaling between Type III Nrg1/ErbB4 regulates transcription through nuclear translocation of Type III Nrg1 intracellular domain (ICD). Defects in Type III Nrg1 are suspected to inhibit this vital neurodevelopmental process, potentially contributing to neurological disorders.<br><br>The similar roles of Type III Nrg1 and CNTN4 in neurodevelopment led to the hypothesis that Type III Nrg1/ErbB4 back signaling influences the expression of CNTN4 in cortical neurons. First, the relationship was tested using non-neuronal human embryonic kidney 293 cells, transfecting them with a wild-type and two mutant forms of Type III Nrg1 to determine the effect of mutations on signaling. CNTN4 expression was greatest in cells treated with wild-type Type III Nrg1/ErbB4 back signaling, indicating a potential link between Type III Nrg1 functionality and CNTN4 expression. Furthermore, neuronal tissue of Type III Nrg1 heterozygous mice exhibited less CNTN4 expression than tissue of the Type III Nrg1 wild-type mice. These findings suggest potential regulation of CNTN4 expression via Type III Nrg1 functionality, providing a possible target for treating the disorder.

CHARACTERIZING NOVEL LOCI IMPORTANT FOR DEMYELINATING PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: A STUDY OF THE SOX10 REGULATED ENHANCER REGIONS AT BCAS3 AND DLG4
Nithya P Vijayakumar
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

Mutations in SOX10, a transcription factor essential for Schwann cell development, have been implicated in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. The enhancer regions at BCAS3 and DLG4 have highly conserved SOX10 binding sites, and as such, may be important for Schwann cell development. This study examines the enhancer activity at BCAS3 and DLG4 and tests the expression of BCAS3 and DLG4 in Schwann cells. Using a luciferase assay, in which the expression of Firefly luciferase vectors combined with the enhancer regions of BCAS3 and DLG4 is compared to the expression of a renilla luciferase control, it was found that the BCAS3 enhancer increases expression about 35-fold, while the DLG4 enhancer increases expression about 3-fold. Through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), it was found that both BCAS3 and DLG4 are expressed in Schwann cells. The results suggest that BCAS3 has a strong enhancer, and DLG4 has a weaker enhancer. With mutated SOX10 binding sites, BCAS3 and DLG4 may both play a role in demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.

IDENTIFYING NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR ACTIVITY FOR TREATMENT OF HORMONE-REFRACTORY PROSTATE CANCER
Rachael Chi-Kue Lee
Walt Whitman High School, Bethesda, MD

A majority of hormone-refractory prostate cancers express androgen receptor (AR) and require AR activity for progression and growth. To identify novel AR modulators, we screened over 120 aromatic compounds for inhibition of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression by real-time RT-PCR in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. We identified two compounds that inhibit PSA mRNA greater than 85% at 2.5 micromolar concentration, containing an m-nitrophenyl group or a n-nitrophenyl group. We also measured AR target gene expression after treatment of LNCaP cells with the synthetic androgen R1881 with or without the lead hits from our screen. We found dose-dependent inhibition of the AR target gene PSA in the presence of R1881. Concentration-dependence studies identified a compound with pure antagonist activity. Mechanism experiments performed using immunocytochemistry with image analysis revealed that the lead compound inhibited both constitutive and R1881-driven nuclear AR localization. Because AR is a transcription factor that must bind to chromatin to be functional, sequestering AR in the cytoplasm is an effective mechanism for blocking AR-driven gene expression. The lead compound also significantly inhibited AR target gene expression and cell growth in the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1, which is insensitive to the FDA-approved antiandrogen bicalutamide. Recently a new program of transcription was shown to drive hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Our lead compound effectively inhibited UBE2C, an exemplar of these important new genes. In summary, we have identified a series of novel compounds that inhibit AR translocation, AR target gene expression, and growth of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

THE ROLE OF THE MIR-106B-25 CLUSTER IN THE PROMOTION OF GLIOMAS
Jovypeter Thevarkattu Paily
Briarcliff High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs may be responsible for the modulation of cancer implicated genes in tumors. Mutated microRNAs, acting as oncogenic promoters, contribute to the development of nearly all forms of cancer, including the most common class of primary brain tumors, gliomas. Anti-miRNAs have been employed to inhibit specific oncogenic microRNA expression with the hopes of treating or potentially curing cancers. This report identifies the mir-106b-25 oncogenic cluster as a prime target for anti-miRNA treatment because of its consistent overexpression in high grade gliomas. The results of this study show that employing anti-miR-106b into glioma cell lines results in a decrease in cell proliferation and tumor formation. MiR-106b’s activity is traced to the knockdown of the tumor suppressor p21 and miR-25’s to the knockdown of the tumor suppressor Bim. Because of miR-106b-25’s suppression of these key tumor suppressors and its role in cell proliferation and tumor formation, this study concludes the miR-106b-25 cluster as a potential target for therapeutic treatment.

OSTEOGENISIS IMPERFECTA IN DACHSHUNDS: MUTATION IN THE GENE SERPINH1
Courtney Marie Kloske
Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL

Dachshunds are often associated with inherited genetic diseases. But how would you know if your dachshund is at risk for a genetic disease? This experiment uses DNA analysis to figure out if my dachshund has a mutation in the gene SERPINH1. This mutation makes the dog more likely to have Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a bone disease. The procedure for this experiment involves purifying cheek cells, isolating and amplifying the SERPINH1 gene using PCR, and analyzing the sequence. The sequence analysis was inconclusive and cannot be used to determine whether my dachshund has the mutation in SERPINH1 or not. Although a conclusion is not possible based on this experiment, I am hopeful that my dog will live a healthy life.

COLOCALIZATION OF NLP IN MITOSIS & OOGENESIS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Maza Rose Tchedou
Carver School of Health Sciences and Research, Atlanta, GA

Condensation and decondensation of DNA are processes that are vital for nuclear function and basic cellular processes. Two specific areas where these processes occur in the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster are mitosis and oogenesis/fertilization. In each case, DNA must be tightly compacted initially and then decondensed when transcription is ready to occur. Condensation and decondensation of DNA occur by way of certain proteins. One such protein that had been identified to possibly play a role is Nucleoplasmin (Nlp). In order to see the location of Nlp during mitosis, KC cells, a Drosophila embryonic cell line, were stained with antibodies directed to Nlp and the mitotic cell marker H3S10P. In order to also see if Nlp was expressed during oogenesis and specifically locolized in the egg, an Nlp-GFP fusion fly line was examined for levels of fluorescence within the egg. The results showed that Nlp was present in the nucleus of the cells in interphase but seems to disappear when mitosis actually begins. In the egg, when green fluorescent protein (GFP) is fused with Nlp, the levels of GFP fluorescence are strong, indicating the presence of Nlp . The presence in the egg could indicate that Nlp might decondense chromatin, particularly the sperm DNA following fertilization, at this time point of the Drosophila lifecycle.

THE EFFECT OF BIOMIMETIC POLYMERS ON THE ENDOTHELIAL GLYCOCALYX
Sheraz Tariq
Manhattan Center For Science and Math, New York, NY

Emphysema weakens the walls of capillaries located on the surface of the alveoli, resulting in an increase in hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Increase of Hydraulic conductivity causes plasma leakage in the lungs known as pulmonary edema. Endothelial cells cover the inner vessel walls and regulate the permeability of the blood vessels through the glycocalyx (extra-cellular proteins). This led scientist to believe that by binding the glycocalyx they can reduce Lp, however non have successfully tested a material that binds the glycocalyx efficiently. Previous research has shown that applying a certain cationic copolymer on the endothelial monolayer decreased the Lp. Bubble tracking was used as a sensor to test polymer 4, 7, and 11 in order to determine which effectively modified the shear induced Lp response (mimicking hydraulic conductivity under blood flow). Results show that the endothelial monolayer treated with the polymer 4 most successfully modified Lp compared to the untreated monolayer. This study will allow the development of optimal treatments for symptoms of emphysema, through further research to discover methods of medical applications.

EVALUATION OF ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTICANCER PROPERTIES OF CAPNELLA IMBRICATA EXTRACTS
Katrina Yue Kay Koon
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in developed countries. Though there are many cancer therapies, most advanced cases have no cure. Natural products from marine organisms such as soft corals exhibit several medicinal properties, including antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities. We extracted two novel products from Capnella imbricata (using ethyl acetate and ethanol) and assessed them for toxicity, and antibacterial and anticancer properties. Toxicity was established by examining survivability of Lumbriculus variegates (black worm) in the presence of the extracts. Five cancer cell lines DLD14 (colon), SKBR3 (breast), LNCaP (prostate), SKMEL28 and ML14 (melanomas) were treated with the extracts, and MTT assays were performed to assess their effect on cell growth. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were utilized in determining regulation of the p53 gene in these cells, a possible pathway by which the extracts work. Antibacterial activity was tested with a Kirby Bauer assay using Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) bacteria. Results indicated that both extracts were nontoxic and possessed anticancer and antibacterial properties. L. variegates survived 100% in the presence of the extracts, at all concentrations tested. The ethyl acetate extract reduced proliferation of all cell lines except DLD14, and inhibited growth of both types of bacteria. The ethanol extract affected growth of the LNCaP cell line and B. subtilis bacteria. The Western blot indicated that p53 may act as a mechanism in four of the tested cell lines. These results suggest that Capnella imbricata may be a potential source of novel drug therapies.

ACIDIFICATION OF DIGESTIVE VACUOLES IS REGULATED BY PH OF THE INGESTED FOOD IN PARAMECIUM
Hoko Nakada
Urawa Daiichi Girls High School, Saitama-shi, Saitama, JAPAN

In Paramecium, foodstuff is incorporated through cytostome into gullet and is packed in digestive vacuoles (DVs). It is well-known that, during the course of food digestion, DVs are acidified following fusions with acidosomes. However, how or by what mechanisms acidosomes are supplied to DVs is still to be clarified. In this experiment mode of acidification of DVs was precisely investigated in axenically maintained Paramecium caudatum.<br><br>In order to detect intravacuolar pH, ciliates were pulsed briefly with polystyrene latex spheres stained with indicator dyes. Cells with stained latex spheres in their DVs were then collected using their negative electrotaxis. <br><br>In the first experiment, whether or not the rate of acidification depends on the size of DV was examined. DVs formed were 5-13 micrometers in diameter and the time required for acidification was different depending on the size of DV. <br><br>In the second experiment, I focused on the pH of ingested food. If the supply of acidosomes is constant per unit time, it is assumed that the pH fall of DV with higher pH stuff will take a longer time than that of lower pH stuff. Latex spheres of pH7, 9 and 10 were given to cells and time courses of acidification were determined. Whichever latex spheres were used, it took 20 min for DVs to reach pH3. This suggests that the rate of supply of acidosomes to DV is regulated according to the pH of ingested food.<br><br>These results demonstrated that the acidification of DVs is regulated by the rate of supply of acidosomes depending on the pH of ingested food in Paramecium caudatum.

CLASSIFICATION OF NICOTINIC-ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS THROUGH ION CURRENT ANALYSIS
Strom Truman Clark
Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy, Lindon, UT

This project categorized different types of ligand-gated ion channels found in the interneuron CA1 region of the hippocampus. The nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor groups consisted of both α3 and β2 receptor protein sub groups. These types of receptors have rarely been studied and are present sporadically throughout the hippocampus where they help to create new memories. <br><br>These cellular receptors rely on groupings of five subunit proteins to expand when in contact with acetylcholine. Acetylcholine molecules bond to these α3 and β2 ion channel receptors to allow flow of energy through the cell. When open, currents in the form of ions (Na+, K+, etc) enter or exit the cell. These α3 and β2 ligand-gated ion channels allow the flow of information through neuron processes. Categorizing these types of ion receptors will permit better understanding of memory creation. Desensitization of these α3 and β2 types of receptors in the hippocampus by disease, age or other causes leads to brain disorders exhibited in symptoms such as Alzheimer’s, anteriograde amnesia, etc. <br><br>This study looked specifically at the 8 possible combinations of the receptor subgroups. I categorized the α3 and β2 receptors by synthesizing RNA from the DNA used to make these α3 and β2 receptors and injected the RNA into frog oocytes. I injected the RNA in different concentrations to get different combinations of α3 and β2 receptors. I then measured the amount of ions let into the cell using and electrode.

IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF A SYNTHETIC PROTEIN: A MODEL FOR ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY
Carolyn Sinow
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo B Syndrome, is a genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). Previous studies have shown synthetic NAGLU is not effective treatment because of poor cell uptake. Attaching an Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) tag to synthetic NAGLU may allow the enzyme to enter cells via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor. My previous research showed that attaching the IGF2 tag directly to NAGLU causes NAGLU to lose its activity. In this project, a glycine-serine linker is used to attach the IGF2 tag to NAGLU to combat this problem. My goal was to create a functional NAGLU-IGF2 fusion protein for preclinical testing.<br><br> The cDNA sequence for NAGLU with a glycine-serine linker attaching the IGF2 tag was cloned into expression vector pCI-Neo to create plasmid pCI-NagGScIGF. pCI-NagGScIGF was amplified using E. coli cells. Plasmids were extracted from E. coli and screened by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA sequencing verified correct construction of pCI-NagGScIGF.<br><br> pCI-NagGScIGF was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to express the modified NAGLU-IGF2. Western blots and NAGLU activity assays confirm that NAGLU-IGF2 is successfully produced and has enzymatic activity. CHO cells producing NAGLU-IGF2 were subcloned, resulting in NAGLU-IGF2’s secretion into the culture medium. NAGLU-IGF2 was collected from the culture medium and purified using Concanavalin-A and c-Myc affinity columns, sequentially. Human Sanfilippo B fibroblasts were treated with purified NAGLU-IGF2, and uptake assays revealed that NAGLU-IGF2 successfully enters cells.

UVA1 SKIN IRRADIATION MODULATES THE MIGRATION OF DENDRITIC CELLS: A NOVEL MECHANISM FOR THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF PHOTOTHERAPY ON SYSTEMIC DISEASE
Alydaar Rangwala
The Albany Academies, Albany, NY

UVA1 light phototherapy is emerging as a treatment for a variety of diseases that involve the immune system. A potential candidate to explain the therapeutic effects of cutaneous radiation is the migratory dendritic cell (DC), an immune system cell primarily located in the epidermis of skin. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an overpopulation of Langerhans cells, epidermal DCs. This research tested the hypothesis that UVA1 may exert a beneficial effect on LCH by facilitating the migration of DCs from the epidermis to the dermis. The double-blind experiment utilized tissue cultures of freshly isolated mouse ear tissue to test the effect of varying intensities of LED-emitted UVA1 irradiation on the migration of DCs from the epidermis to the dermis, induced by a migration stimulus called CCL21. One side of the ear tissue had direct UVA1 exposure, while the other didn’t have direct UVA1 exposure, but rather, indirect exposure due to UVA1’s tissue penetrating properties. After 48 hours of exposure, the ear tissues were sectioned using a cryostat, immunolabeled for a Langerin protein specific antibody that identified the DCs, and analyzed by cell counts using microscopy. The density (cells/mm) of the UVA1-direct epidermis, 42% greater than the control, was significantly (p<.01) greater than the density of the UVA1-indirect epidermis, 152% less than the control. The data shows that UVA1 radiation impacts DC migration, likely through an attraction between the light and cells. This effect may aid the body in fighting several autoimmune and systemic diseases, including lupus and scleroderma.

ELICITING AN ANTIVIRAL IMMUNE RESPONSE TO INHIBIT HIV INFECTION
Shemonti Rabeya Hasan
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

The purpose of this project was to discover the most effective inducer related to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), such as prostratin and 1-stearoyl-2-arachdonyl-sn-glycerol (SAG), in signaling an antiviral immune response through cell differentiation and IL-2 production. In addition, rather than just adding the IL-2 protein to prevent HIV replication, this project analyzed how inducing IL-2 production could help prevent HIV infection. These objectives were determined by first treating monocytic cells with the inducers to detect cell differentiation. Next, T cells infected with HIV were treated with the inducers to observe IL-2 production and IL-2’s effect on HIV infection. Results demonstrated that prostratin induced the most cell differentiation. Although IL-2 was not produced, a decrease in HIV infection still occurred, most likely because the inducer decreased CD4 receptor expression. Thus, this prevented HIV access into the cell. Further research will be required to determine the optimum inducer concentration for both monocytes and T cells in order to stimulate cell differentiation and IL-2 production simultaneously. Through these results, prostratin has the highest potential in signaling an antiviral immune response. By assisting the cells to detect and decrease viral levels through prostratin, prostratin can help progress towards a treatment that not only decreases the rate of infection more effectively than HAART, but also provides the ability to gain immunity against multiple mutated forms of the virus that can exist within a body. In addition, treatments with an inducer like prostratin can increase progress towards eliminating the HIV epidemic.

THE ROLE OF CDNB IN UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF JS-K, A PROMISING ANTI-LEUKEMIA COMPOUND
Stephen Alexander Lavanier
Governor Thomas Johnson High School, Frederick, MD

Previous studies have shown that JS-K (O2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate), which belongs to the diazeniumdiolate group of compounds, is a promising anti-cancer agent. The uniqueness of JS-K is due to its ability to exploit the defense system of cancer cells against xenobiotics that leads to chemotherapy failure. JS-K consists of two components – a diazeniamdiolate group necessary for the release of nitric oxide (NO) and an arylating ring – and it is unknown which is responsible for the biological effects of the compound. In this project, murine erythroleukemia cells were treated with JS-K or CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene), which contains an arylating ring analogous to that of JS-K without the diazeniumdiolate group necessary to release NO. Because treatment with pure NO is impractical, studying the activity of the arylating ring of JS-K in comparison to the entire molecule will help us understand the biological mechanisms of this compound. The effects of CDNB and JS-K on cell proliferation, cell morphology, induction of apoptosis and DNA damage as well as cell cycle inhibition were compared. Experiments were performed using several methods, including proliferation and apoptotic assays, DNA-laddering, Western blotting and cell cycle analysis. The results indicate that both compounds at low IC50 values inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, cause DNA damage and inhibit the cell cycle in leukemia cells, although JS-K was slightly more potent than CDNB. I conclude from these data that both the NO-releasing capacity of JS-K and its arylating ring contribute to JS-K’s anti-leukemia activity. This information may be useful in developing even more potent anticancer agents.

IDENTIFICATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN RESVERATROL ACTION ON SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE GROWTH
John David Mueller
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced naturally by different plants when being attacked by bacteria and fungi, and is a well-known constituent of red wine. Studies in rodents have associated resveratrol treatment with increased cell life span as well as interference with cancer cell proliferation. Such studies have resulted in the marketing of resveratrol as a nutritional supplement with anti-aging and anti-cancer properties. Yeast studies indicate that resveratrol increases replicative life span, and the chromatin protein Sir2, as well as telomerase has been implicated in this process. Several other genes are likely involved in pathways of resveratrol action. This study focused on the identification of genes which may be involved in resveratrol action. A collection of 192 knockout mutations covering approximately 3% of the yeast genome were screened for changes in cell growth in the presence or absence of resveratrol. This “resveratrol” screen identified 11 candidate genes, 3 of which exhibited repeatable effects. These genes (RPL20B, USA1 and PUT4) include a ribosomal protein, a protein associated with splicing factors, and a permease. A human homologue (RPL18A protein) was identified for the ribosomal protein (RPL20B gene). The role of this gene in resveratrol action may be interesting to examine in future studies. This study illustrates the power of utilizing yeast mutants in conjunction with genome databases to identify genes with a desired function or important role. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify novel human genes involved in cellular processes related to aging and cancer.

THE NATURAL COMPOUND CELASTROL, A NOVEL INDUCER OF THE STRESS RESPONSE PROTEIN HEME OXYGENASE-1, CONFERS CYTOPROTECTION AND PROMOTES WOUND REPAIR IN CELL CULTURE
Alex Lee Han
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

The heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) system is considered to be an essential cytoprotective mechanism. It is activated by a variety of cellular stresses including oxidative injury, heavy metal toxicity, thermal stress, and inflammatory cytokines. The discovery of HO-1’s role in cytoprotection and wound healing has stimulated research having direct clinical implications for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and hemorrhagic shock. Consequently, induction of HO-1 with an effective and readily obtainable pharmacological agent would have tremendous benefits in a clinical setting. Celastrol is an active extract from the Chinese “Thunder of God” vine, which has been used for centuries to treat common colds and fevers. In previous research, celastrol was shown to induce the cellular heat shock response by activating the heat shock transcriptional factor 1 (HSF1). Because HSF1 is known to be involved in HO-1 gene regulation, it was hypothesized that celastrol could be used to induce HO-1 expression. This independent study demonstrates, for the first time, that celastrol activates HO-1 transcription in vitro. Celastrol was shown to induce high levels of HO-1 expression using bioluminescence and quantitative real-time PCR, and celastrol pretreatment conferred cytoprotection in response to lethal thermal and oxidative stress in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. In addition, a wound repair model developed in cell culture demonstrated celastrol to be an accelerant of the wound repair process. These results are promising indicators for celastrol as a treatment for a wide variety of health conditions.

MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF LOWER FEMALE GENITAL TRACT EPITHELIAL CELL CULTURES IN DIFFERENT GROWTH CONDITIONS
Vivian Wingsee Leung
Abbey Park High School, Oakville, Ontario, CANADA

Epithelial cells of vaginal and cervical mucosa in women are the primary barrier against sexually transmitted pathogens, including viruses such as herpes and HIV and bacteria such as Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea. In current microbicide research, some agents are effective against HIV-1 infection in vitro but not in vivo. In vivo, the epithelium is exposed to an air-liquid interface (ALI), drawing nutrients from its basolateral side; however, in previous in vitro studies, a liquid-liquid interface (LLI) is employed where cells are submerged in media. To better understand the mucosa and pathogen interactions, more accurate in vitro models must be developed. This experiment was to determine whether an ALI culture of female reproductive tract epithelia better represents in vivo morphology and functionality compared to conventional LLI culture. Over a 20-day time-course, human vaginal, ectocervical and endocervical epithelial cell lines were grown in either ALI or LLI. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured daily. At various intervals, cultures were fixed for immunohistochemistry, immunofluoresence and electron microscopy, or analyzed by mitochondrial COX assay. ALI cultures demonstrated squamous, stratified morphology in ectocervical and vaginal cells similar to in vivo, as well as differences in cellular organization and intracellular structures, such as mitochondria and keratinisation. Additionally, in simple columnar endocervical cells, ALI cultures maintained tighter junctions longer. These differences affect the epithelium’s behaviour and integrity as a barrier. This novel ALI model for these epithelia more closely represents in vivo characteristics than conventional LLI and can lead to more effective treatments for sexually transmitted infections.

KOMBUCHA TEA: THE EFFECTS OF A CURE-ALL TEA ON BREAST CANCER CELLS
Dahyana Arias
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

This project is focused on learning about the effects of kombucha tea on breast cancer cells. Kombucha tea is believed to be a possible treatment for breast cancer. This project attempts to find out whether this is possible<br><br>Hypotheses: If kombucha tea is added to a breast cancer cell culture (MCF-7), then the tea will stunt cell proliferation.<br><br>If black tea is added to a breast cancer cell culture (MCF-7), then the tea will not have any noticeable effect on cell proliferation.<br><br>If black tea is added to a healthy human cell culture (MRC-5), then the tea will positively effect cell proliferation.<br><br>If black tea is added to a healthy human cell culture (MRC-5), then the tea will not have any noticeable effect on cell proliferation.<br><br>Cultured MCF-7 and MRC-5 cells were used to determine the effects of kombucha tea. The cells were placed in 96-well plates with 5% kombucha tea, 2.5% kombucha tea, 5% black tea, 2.5% black tea, and no tea at all. The well plates were placed in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 7 days. Cell proliferation was measured with an MTT Assay.<br><br>The results showed that black tea had a greater effect on both types of cells than the kombucha tea did. It also showed that kombucha tea could raise cell proliferation. This proves my hypotheses incorrect except for the kombucha tea with MRC-5 cells, none of the cells acted as expected. These results questioned the belief that kombucha tea can be used as a treatment for breast cancer.

THE EFFECTS OF CURCUMIN AND PACLITAXEL ON BREAST CANCER CELL SURVIVAL AND THE NUCLEAR FACTOR KAPPA B PATHWAY
Lola Yu
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA

The ultimate purpose of this project was to find a safer, cheaper treatment for breast cancer patients. Today, chemotherapeutics are very expensive and have many side effects. Therefore, a natural substance with anti-cancer effects, such as Curcumin, is of high interest. <br><br> Curcumin is an Indian spice derived from turmeric plant and is known to induce apoptosis within breast cancer cells through the inhibition of the NF-kB pathway. NF-kB is a protein complex found in the cytoplasm of cells in an inactive state. It is regulated by two known proteins, IKK and IkB-alpha. In cancer cells, the activation of NF-kB leads to cell growth and metastasis. Thus, it is important to understand how Curcumin can inhibit this pathway. <br><br> In these experiments, different combinations of Curcumin and Paclitaxel were tested on the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, in order to see if it would inhibit cell proliferation any more than either Curcumin or Paclitaxel alone. Also, a pretreatment of Curcumin versus Paclitaxel was tested to see if there were any additive effects. Lastly, this project gave a deeper insight to the inner workings of Curcumin by focusing on its effects on the NF-kB pathway. <br><br> The findings of these experiments show that specific combinations of Curcumin and Paclitaxel have additive effects in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth. In the future, it is possible for breast cancer patients to decrease their intake of Paclitaxel by consuming Curcumin, as well. This project encourages further research on Curcumin and its future impact on breast cancer.

THE EFFECT OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC VINCRISTINE ON TRANSPOSON MOBILIZATION-INDUCED FLANKING SEQUENCE MUTATION RATES OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Smita Shukla
Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science at WPI, Worcester, MA

The chemotherapeutic drug vincristine was investigated to determine the possibility of alteration to flanking sequence damage caused by transposon mobilization. It was expected that transposition damage rates would either increase or remain unaffected by vincristine consumption due to the slowing of cell-cycle processes. <br><br> In order to induce transposition and cause flanking mutations, the balanced rhinoKG vector and delta-2-3 transposase Drosophila melanogaster strains were crossed. Resulting sets of the white-eyed male F1 progeny were fed varying concentrations of drug mixture and eventually crossed with virgin rhi2 mutant-allele females so that the precision of transposon mobilization excision could be determined. A phenotypic assay of eye mutations ensured viability of stocks not containing a reinsertion of the P Element, which encodes for the white-eye gene. In addition, rhi2/ rhiKG progeny were scored to detect effective non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA-damage response systems, along with appendage fusion rates. The transposon excision spot of the resulting F2 generation was assayed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis.<br><br> Using these assays, the identified mutations were compared to determine significant changes from balanced mutant allele strains. DNA damage closest to the hot-spot of DNA translocation origin was studied to discover the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on transposon inhibition. Collected data suggests that vincristine may have inhibited P Element excision, while the rhinoKG strains may have improper excision without identifiable phenotypic alterations. In addition, the practicality of transposon inhibition was investigated to find the implications of such genetic movement in future gene-therapy models.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE QUALITY OF RNA BY USE OF FASTPREP®-24
Herman Li
John D. O' Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Roxbury, MA

RNA helps synthesize proteins and regulates gene expression. It is studied to understand expression of diseases. Extracting high quality RNA is difficult because it is sensitive and easily degraded. FastPrep®-24 is an instrument used to homogenize the sample before extracting RNA.<br><br> It was hypothesized that controlling conditions under which oral RNA is extracted optimizes the quality of the RNA. Tested variables include the cooling unit for FastPrep®-24, the number of cycles on FastPrep®-24, the use of RNAlater (a product used to preserve RNA), and the effectiveness of trimming the mice mandibles to isolate the target area. Temperature and sonication effects were also considered.<br><br> To extract RNA, samples of mice mandibles were lysed using the FastPrep®-24 instrument. The RNA was then extracted through a standard centrifugation process. The RNA was tested in gels that were run through an electrophoresis apparatus to observe the quality of the samples. <br><br> To preserve the samples and maintain the quality of the RNA before lysing, it was concluded that using RNAlater as opposed to extracting RNA from freshly isolated samples is better. Using RNAlater, it is best to allow for deeper penetration of the RNAlater into the tissue. Trimming and sonicating the sample so that the marrow is exposed before lysing increases the effectiveness of RNAlater. Low temperatures maintain quality so the cooling unit is essential. Up to three cycles of lysing with the FastPrep®-24 instrument is recommended before degradation of the samples occur. This process optimizes the quality of extracted RNA and allows more efficient study of oral diseases.

MODELING AND APPLICATIONS OF SUPPRESSOR TRNAS TO THE BOOLEAN SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM
Eric McLaran Sawyer
Central High School, Saint Joseph, MO

The purpose of the investigation was to construct a biological system that solves a version of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. A SAT problem consists of logical clauses each containing a string of several true-false variables connected by OR operators. Logical clauses are linked by the AND operator to form a complete problem. A problem is satisfied if true and false can be assigned to each variable in such a way that the value of the entire problem is true. The biological construct of the SAT problem uses frameshift suppressor tRNAs that contain five-nucleotide anticodons. These tRNAs act as the variables, and are complementary to series of DNA 5-mers inserted immediately after the ATG start codon of a gene, creating a frameshift mutation. A functional protein is produced only if the correct set of tRNAs is present to suppress the frameshift mutation. In addition to the wet lab work, a physical model of a suppressor tRNA was constructed using 3D printing technology. The model was designed by modifying an existing tRNA file on the Protein Data Bank—a collection of freely available molecular structures. The PDB format uses a xyz coordinate system to describe the location of each atom in the file. Designing the model required using reverse engineering to insert nucleotides into the structure and moving existing nucleotides to accommodate the insertion. Rotational and translational matrices were used to transform the coordinates of individual atoms and place them in chemically reasonable locations.

REGULATION OF ZINC TRANSPORTERS WITHIN THE PROSTATE EPITHELIUM HAS A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER IN THE PROSTATE
Jacob Khan Sterling
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

This project examined the role of the Zip 1 zinc transporter in prostate tissue with specific attention to the question as to whether this transporter directly correlates with the development of prostate malignancy. The experimental design compared malignant and non-malignant prostate tissue. My results indicate that there was no correlation between prostate cancer and zinc transporters. I have accepted my null hypothesis, that is if we test the regulation of zinc transporters' gene expression in the prostate, there will be no significant relationship between zinc transporters' regulation and the development of prostate cancer. Therefore, I disproved my hypothesis that irregular regulation of zinc transporters' gene expressions are an essential requirement for the development of prostate cancer.

MULTI-MODAL CONFOCAL MOSAICING MICROSCOPY FOR NON-MELANOMA SKIN CANCER DETECTION
Nathaniel Wei-Sen Chen
Merlo Station High School, Beaverton, OR

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a form of non-melanoma skin cancer, with 250,000 new cases reported annually in the United States. Multimodal confocal mosaicing for the detection of residual tumor in skin cancer excisions is a novel method that is faster and cheaper than the labor-intensive frozen histology process. The procedure has been proven on basal cell carcinomas, but SCCs remain difficult to detect. A commercial reflectance confocal microscope was modified for independent fluorescence excitation at the 532nm and 488nm wavelengths. In this work, more complete screening for SCCs is shown to be feasible utilizing acridine orange for nuclei staining, eosin for cytoplasmic contrast, and a reflectance mode for dermal collagen. An algorithm for pseudo-staining gathered images is developed and applied. Multimodal confocal mosaicing may provide a rapid, less costly alternative to hematoxylin and eosin histology in pathological margin mapping, increasing patient comfort and bringing pathology to the operating table.

THE EFFECTS OF MUCIN-4/SIALOMUCIN COMPLEX ON THE EXPRESSION OF ERBB2, ERBB3 AND ERBB4 IN BREAST ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS
Shanique Anthonet Martin
Maritime and Science Technology Academy, Miami, FL

Mucins are large, heavily glycosylated proteins found on epithelial cell surfaces, and their overexpression in tumors has been implicated in malignancy. Mucin 4 is believed to associate with the ErbB2 through one of its EGF-like domains. Also, ErbB3 is known to heterodimerize with ErbB2 in the presence of NRGB1. <br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not Muc4 had an effect on the total levels of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors in a human breast cancer cell line, MCF7 (ATCC). The ability of Muc4 to enhance ErbB2 phosphorylation induce colocalization in the same cell line was also investigated. It was postulated that Muc4 would increase the total receptor levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 but not that of ErbB4. It was also hypothesized that ErbB2 signaling would be enhanced by Muc4 in the presence of NRGB1 and that Muc4 would colocalize with ErbB2.<br><br> Tet-regulated MCF-7 cells were induced to express Muc4 for 72 hrs and 130 hrs by removing tetracycline from the cell culture medium. Cell lysates were analyzed via SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and western blot. In order to conduct Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy, the same cell line was grown on 6mm glass cover slips. <br><br> The study showed that Muc4 expression does not increase the total levels of either ErbB receptor at the time points studied; however, the samples with inhibited Muc4 expression showed increased expression of the three ErbB receptors. It also showed that Muc4 enhances ErbB2 phosphorylation in the presence of NRGB1 after 72hrs of incubation and induced colocalization of ErbB2 in MCF7 cells.

CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY RESEARCH VACCINE: MANNOSE GLYCOPROTEIN ENCAPSULATED PLGA FLUORESCENT NANOPARTICLES BIOTINYLATED FOR CONJUGATION WITH CPG OLIGODEOXYRIBONUCLEOTIDE FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
Riley C Ennis
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

A cancer vaccine with the ability to stimulate the cell-mediated immune system in order to safely recognize and remove tumor cells from the body with no side effects; is the ultimate goal of this research. The selected immune pathway is activated through a mannose glycoprotein encapsulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) nanoparticle conjugated with CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide, which instantiates the release of cytotoxic and memory t-cells. The major components of this vaccine are taken directly from the patient, creating a biologically specific and cost effective cancer treatment. The experiment specifically tested the effectiveness of the mannose glycoprotein coat of the vaccine. The glycoprotein was extracted directly from human breast cancer serum, and inoculated into the Protoreaster nodosus and Octopus briareus research specimens. The organisms where also injected with SAIVI™ microspheres, which congregate in areas of inflammation, in order to view the migration of the immune cells throughout the organisms using a Maestro© in vivo imaging unit at Georgetown University. Nine of the fifteen starfish imaged and all of the octopi imaged displayed an immune response to the mannose glycoprotein vaccine around the area of injection. In conclusion, this research creates an innovative cancer vaccine that has the potential to eradicate tumor cells locally and safely from the body. The data suggests that the mannose glycoprotein portion of the vaccine is an effective dendritic cell based cancer vaccine adjuvant at eliciting a strong but local immune response. Currently, this vaccine is being tested in Danio rerio, to isolate the immune cells being activated by the vaccine.

METASTATIC MELANOMA: PRODUCT OF INTRACELLULAR CONFERENCING THE ROLE OF CROSSTALK BETWEEN THE PTEN/PI-3K PATHWAY AND WNT PATHWAY IN DEREGULATING CYTOSOLIC AND NUCLEAR AMOUNTS OF THE ONCOGENIC TRANSACTIVATOR B-CATENIN
Zichao Kang
Old Scona Academic High School, Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA

This project looks to shed light on the molecular changes in the cell biology of melanocytes as they progress from healthy skin cells into cancerous melanoma melanocytes. I aim to find the protein(s) central to melanoma progression, discover mechanisms regulating that protein and, finally, test theoretical practices of restoring normal cell conditions in metastatic melanoma cells.<br><br> First, Western Immunoblotting, densitometry analysis and immunocytochemistry were performed to detect the amounts of B-catenin, a potential onco-transactivator in melanoma. Levels of cytoplasmic and active forms of B-catenin were found to increase as melanoma progresses, suggesting that B-catenin is indeed the driving protein behind melanoma progression.<br><br> My project goes on to explore potential cell signalling pathways that may be responsible for B-catenin deregulation in melanoma. After Western Immunoblotting and densitometry analysis of key proteins in the PI-3K pathway (AKT, P-AKT, PTEN) and Wnt pathway (B-catenin, active B-catenin, p-B-catenin, GSK-3B, Dishevelled), it was found that the 2 pathways interact through an intermediary signalling protein, GSK-3B. Through this interaction, PI-3K indirectly increases B-catenin levels in cancer, fuelling melanoma progression. <br><br> Finally, I tested whether partially inhibiting the PI-3K pathway by introducing PTEN into metastatic melanoma would reStore normal B-catenin levels. PTEN was transfected into human metastatic melanoma melanocytes. After performing immunoblotting, densitometry analysis, immunocytochemistry and nuclear-cytosolic fractionation on the cell lines, it was found that both B-catenin levels and localization are restored to normal. This discovery opens the door for novel gene therapy in the form of nanoparticle or viral transfection of PTEN into body cells.<br><br>

DO NMDA RECEPTORS AFFECT EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT?
Claire Louise Edgcumbe
Kitsilano Secondary, Vancouver, CANADA

N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) neuroreceptors are glutamate receptors, known to mediate learning and memory in the adult brain. This project tests whether NMDA receptors play a role in neuronal growth during early brain development. Research based on NMDA receptors is important because abnormal NMDA activity is associated with schizophrenia. <br><br>A two photon microscope was used to image single neurons at ten minute intervals in vivo in Xenopus Laevus tadpoles. NMDA receptors were blocked with the NMDA antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovelerate acid (APV). The neuron images from the two photon microscope were analyzed using a novel technique that records the growth of both growth cone filopodia (GCF) and interstitial filopodia (IF). <br><br>GCFs are dynamic dendritic protrusions located within 5µm of the tip of a dendrite. GCFs are constantly searching for directions in which the dendrite can grow. IFs are localized filopodia that form long term synaptic connections. They depend on synaptic activity for growth and stability.<br><br> <br><br>It was found that, when tadpoles were exposed to APV there was a increase in stability of GCF and a 61% decrease in the stability of IFs. These results show that NMDA receptors play an important role in the development of dendritic IFs and GCFs. Furthermore, the decrease in IF stability may be a result of synaptic abnormalities, caused by low levels of NMDA activity, that correspond to abnormalities seen in schizophrenic patients. Further research should be pursued to fully understand the long term consequences of blocking NMDA receptors and its relation to schizophrenia.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF TELOMERASE MUTATIONS IN DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA
Katherine Taneille Johnson
North Peace Secondary School, Fort St. John, British Columbia, CANADA

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains and elongates telomeres. The telomerase enzyme complex is composed of RNA hTR and the protein reverse transcriptase, hTERT. Mutations in hTERT have been identified and linked to hematological disease states such as Aplastic anemia and Dyskeratosis congenita (DC). Certain mutations cause a decrease in telomerase activity. It was hypothesized that this decrease in telomerase activity and shortened telomeres predominantly would limit the replication of specific tissue stem cells. The goal of this study was to define functional interactions within telomerase complexes expressing certain hTERT mutants to further understand how these mutations lead to telomere and telomerase deficiency in DC. Four naturally occurring mutants of hTERT- A279T, P721R, K902N, and R979W- were studied through both in vitro and in vivo methods including western blot, immunoprecipitation, and telomerase enzyme activity assay. Mutants were reconstituted in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription and translation system for in vitro assays. In vivo work included transient and stable transfections of these mutants in the 293T cell line. In vitro assays illustrated that A279T, P721R, and R979W mutations do not impair telomerase activity, and hTERT is still properly produced. The K902N mutant was shown to suppress a majority of telomerase activity in vitro, with small amounts of catalytic activity present. Transient and stable transfections mostly confirm in vitro results; however, suspected experimental error and time constraints prevented these procedures from being optimized properly. Through research of telomerase mutations, the treatments used to prevent DC may be elucidated.

MOLECULAR INSIGHTS ON DNA UPTAKE AND TRANSIT PATHWAYS IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Uliana Maria Kovaltchouk
Sisler High School, Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA

Human genetic therapy requires a molecular system of delivery into malfunctioning eukaryotic cells. In order to study this system, Saccharmomyces cerevisiae was transformed with the plasmid YEPlac195, labeled with Alexa- Fluor555, and followed throughout the cell. Factors concerned with the LiAc/ssDNA/PEG method of yeast transformation were also assessed and adjusted accordingly to allow for optimal transformation results. Several approaches were taken towards the objective, first using yeast immuno-fluorescence with methanol/acetone dehydration, then transforming strains containing fusion proteins <br><br> Overall results indicate that large concentrations of DNA were found in endosomes, suggesting that DNA is endosytoced into cells. Sizeable amounts of DNA were also found inside the cell periphery after micrococcal nuclease was applied, further indicating that the cell takes up a significant amount of DNA. However, as DNA was found to fluoresce in the vacuole, most of the DNA was degraded, and was then distributed throughout the cell. The final destination in 1-5% of the cells was identified as the nucleus. Microscopy results also indicated that DNA was highly concentrated in the bud scars, indicating that cells utilize them as an entry system. <br><br> Gene therapy relies on a drug molecule reaching its intended site to allow therapeutic effects to be realized. However, if this does not occur, nonspecific effects may be exerted by the drug through interactions with non-intentional targets. Thus, by assessing the pathway of cellular DNA uptake, more efficient techniques can be developed to enhance this pathway and create a more successful delivery system.

THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A NEODYMIUM-IRON-BORON MAGNET ON THE REPRODUCTION RATE OF CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY CELLS
Kinga Janina Malkinska
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

A large industry, with a substantial market promotes magnetic items, such as bracelets or belts. This huge sell is based on controversial claims of the healing and stimulating properties of the magnets. Following these claims, it was hypothesized that a static magnetic field of a permanent Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnet with the strength of 0.5 tesla would significantly stimulate the reproduction rate of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Studies of cells, rather than opinions of clients, were expected to provide more reliable evidence about the link between magnetism and living organisms. The mammalian cells were dispersed in Petri dishes with a growth medium, and placed in an incubator. Three of the Petri dishes with a 2 mm grid were placed above Nd-Fe-B magnets with a 0.5 tesla field, whereas the control dish was not exposed to a strong magnetic field. Photographs of selected grid squares with cells were taken in 4, 8, 23, and 28 hours periods using an optical microscope with a built-in digital camera and manually counted on a computer screen at home. The reproduction rate of the cells was measured by the percent increase in the number of cells. The mean percent increase of the control cells was 293%, and of the experimental cells exposed to the magnetic field was significantly lower - 250%. The data did not support the hypothesis abut stimulating effect of the field on growth and reproduction of the mammallian cells. The magnetic field had marked inhibitory effect on the reproduction of the cells which is consistent with the published data on slower reproduction of cancer cells exposed to an oscillating magnetic field and some experiments carried out at about 20 times stronger fields. It's likely due to the magnetic force which affects ion and electron transport in cells.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DROSOPHILA LAMIN PROTEINS AND DF31
Denis Coral Jaimes
Cross Keys High School, Atlanta, GA

Chromatin organization is essential in order for cells and an organism overall to function properly. Without proper structure within a nucleus, vital information for transcription and DNA regulation cannot occur, which can lead to disease states such as cancer, muscular dystrophy, and laminopathies. Laminopathies are shown to occur due to the disruption of the Lamin proteins. These lamin proteins are intermediate filaments found in the nuclear matrix and are known to provide structural and functional support to chromatin. Previous data showing co-localization with Decondensation Factor 31 (Df31) and the lamin proteins found in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that Df31 may also play a role in chromatin organization. Published in vitro research indicates that Df31 decondenses Xenopus sperm and also acts as a histone chaperone. The implications of this combined data may indicate a functional interaction between the lamin proteins and Df31. If Lamin C is knocked out, then the localization of Df31 should be disrupted, thus causing disorganization of the nucleus. To test this possible functional interaction, 3rd instar larval disks were immunostained for the Df31 and Lamin C proteins. The immunostaining method was utilized because it allows direct visualization of the Df31 and lamin proteins. Contrary to the stated hypothesis, mutated flies that lacked Lamin C showed that there was no effect on the localization of Df31. This indicates that although the proteins co-localize, there may be no functional interaction between the two. Future experiments include Df31 co-immunostaining with the mutants of the more predominant lamin, Lamin DMO. Also, the knock out or knock down of Df31 could help to better understand the relationship between Df31 and the lamins.

THE EFFECT OF INJECTING STEM CELLS INTO CADAVERIC DE-CELLULARIZED LUNGS
Pooja Tushar Desai
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

Cystic Fibrosis and Emphysema are two of the most common fatal lung diseases in the world today. Along with pulmonary fibrosis, these diseases all have no cure and are a leading cause of death for people all over the world. They all cause difficulty breathing and ultimately lead to lung failure and death. Although they can be monitored and there are treatment options, there is no approach that can cure these diseases. If the patient is healthy enough there is the option of having lung transplantation. The problem with lung transplants is that there will never be enough lung donors to meet the current and future transplantation needs. With an increase in lung transplantations in the past few years, there simply aren’t enough lungs to go around to all of the patients. I hypothesize that new lungs can be created by injecting embryonic stem cells into cadaveric, de-cellularized lungs. If the de-cellularization process is conducted correctly, the lungs should maintain their original structure, their extracellular matrix, their protein composition, and their pulmonary vascular network. The tissues were de-cellularized and then re-cellularized with embryonic stem cells with help from my mentor. I then extracted RNA from the cells, converted the mRNA to cDNA using reverse transcription, and ran a PCR to amplify specific genes. These results provided a platform for proving my hypothesis and also set the stage for future research.

RNAI AS A SAFE METHOD OF INSECT POPULATION CONTROL
Roshan Palli, Joseph Corbett Ferguson, 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Presently, most of the insect are controlled using pesticides which contaminate the environment and have deleterious effects in humans. This study was conducted attempting to find an alternative to pesticides in insect population control. RNA interference (RNAi) is a method using double-stranded RNA to knock-down the expression of target genes. To test whether RNAi could be used to control pest populations, RNAi was employed to knock-down three genes (acetylcholinesterase, AchE; Actin and Coatomer subunit beta, COPβ) in the Colorado potato beetle (CPB). Since these genes code for proteins that are an important part of an insect’s life, we hypothesized that the RNAi beetles will die. Three methods of delivery of dsRNA (in-vitro synthesis, bacterial synthesis, and plant mediated synthesis) were tested. Equal amounts of control (green fluorescence protein producing Bacteria, water), or treatments (AchE, Actin and COPβ) were fed to beetles with their diets. Weight gain and mortality of the beetles were recorded every four days for 20 days. Our results have shown that knocking down the three genes had a significant impact on the survival of the CPB, and the Actin and COPβ were the most effective. Actin and COPβ were also very effective in stunting the growth of the beetles. AchE, however, was not as effective. Our data showed that RNAi can be used as a safer alternative to pesticides, and could even be less costly. Our results could be used by farmers around the world to protect their potatoes, eggplants, or tomatoes from CPB damage.

This project is a result of an experiment to determine whether genotypes with the highest quality of meat could be found. If the quality of USDA Prime meat could be increased by utilizing DNA testing in beef cattle, world demand may increase.<br><br><br> Blood samples from 55 steers were provided by the University of Arkansas. The blood samples were tested for each individual steer's genotype. The genotypes were graded using the USDA standard by the Oklahoma State meat judging team. The best genotype for P450, for the quality of meat was determined by using a scale of 4-10 with 10 being the highest quality of meat. The protein Prolactin was used to find out which of the genotypes has the highest amount of daily weight gain.<br><br><br> The P450 genotype CC had the highest quality of the meat with an average of 6.6, GC with 6.2, and GG with 6.1. The protein Prolactin had a result of CT having the highest amount of average daily weight gain with 1.76 kg for the Stockpiled Fescue, 4.82 kg for the Birth to Weaning, and 9.02 kg for the Feedlot Stage. The CC followed with 1.54 kg, 4.83 kg, and 8.36 kg. Last was TT with 0.880 kg, 5.27 kg, and 8.36 kg.<br><br><br> This project suggested that the CC genotype for P450 has the highest quality of meat. It also suggested that the CT genotype for the protein Prolactin resulted in the highest amount of daily weight gain in beef cattle.

The aim of our project is to demonstrate and to ascertain which changes happen on a plant tissue in Allium cepa L. as results of inhibition by lead. We focus on guard cells of an leaf epidermis.<br><br>Seeds were watered by destilated water and by 5 different concentrations of Pb(NO3)2. We measured out length of root and leaf after 12 day-long-exposition, we calculated tolerantion index and made microscopic photos. A toxicity of lead with rised concentration caused reduced growth of roots and leaves of inhibited plants. Toleration index was also descending. There were no differences in<br><br>germenability because seeds were soused before the experiment. We also measured density of guard cells on epidermis of Allium cepa L. and we did not find any changes between plants watered with<br><br>destilated water and solutions with lead. With rising concentration of lead we noticed rised density of deformated guard cells and also rised number of nucleuses decentralized from middle of guard cell. In<br><br>our project we refer to changes which happend after inhibition plants by lead on guard cells of leaf of Allium cepa L. All this changes argue toxicity of lead in nature, especially caused by industrial pollution of our environment.

DAMAGING ESCHERICHIA COLI CONTAINING A PGAL PLASMID WITH UV LIGHT TO IDENITFY BETA GALACTOSIDASE
Fiona Lynn Kearns, Lauren Allison, 
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect UV light has on the transformation process in E. coli by using a pGAL plasmid sample to identify the performance of the Beta Galactosidase protein. Bacterial transformation is a technique used where foreign DNA is introduced into bacteria causing an increased production of the protein for which the plasmid is coded. This new science has the potential to be used in treatments for cancer. Ultraviolet radiation is used in cancer treatments and therapies, thus it is significant to know the effects UV light has on the efficiency of bacterial transformation.<br><br>Agar was prepared for eighty plates with X-Gal which, when metabolized by β-Galactosidase, produces a blue dye that coats the E. coli cell. Two-thirds of the plates also had ampicillin added to their media. The pGAL plasmid codes for ampicillin resistance and successful transformation should allow for blue colony growth on plates with both X-Gal and ampicillin in their media. Three groups were divided out of 80 plates: Control (X-Gal/noAMP/no pGAL), Experimental 1 (X-GAL/AMP/no pGAL), and Experimental 2 (X-Gal/AMP/pGAL). Half from each group were irradiated with UV-C light for 30 seconds each.<br><br>The hypothesis, E. coli samples not exposed to UV light will have higher rates of pGAL plasmid transformation success indicated by a higher blue colony count, was supported. The data shows that the pGAL plasmid can replicate while the organism repairs its own DNA, though the UV radiation and possibly the DNA repair does hinder the transformation efficiency.

REACTIVATION OF THE EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE TFPI-2 BY CURCUMIN INHIBITS INVASIVENESS AND INDUCES CELL DEATH IN LIVER CANCER CELLS
Monali Gautam Haldankar, Anna Duan, 
duPont Manual High School, Louisville

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common and third most fatal cancer worldwide. Due to increased alcoholism and obesity, HCC is one of the few cancers with a rising incidence rate in the US.<br><br> Curcumin, an extract of Tumeric, is a compound derived from the plant Curcuma longa. It has been shown to inhibit growth and induce cell death in various cancer cells, including HCC. These anti-tumor properties stem from Curcumin’s ability to differentiate cancer cells and target them.<br><br> Epigenetic factors such as histone deacetylation are implicated in the silencing of critical tumor suppressor genes, leading to carcinogenesis. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), a serine protease inhibitor, is a tumor suppressor gene known to be epigenetically silenced in over 90% of all HCC. Reactivation of TFPI-2 in HCC has been shown to inhibit invasion, tumor growth, metastasis, and also induce apoptosis.<br><br> The goal of this study was to examine Curcumin’s ability to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene TFPI-2 in HepG2, a well characterized human HCC cell line. HepG2 cells were treated with epigenetic modulators 5-Azacytidine (5-AZA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) to determine the method of epigenetic modification. Curcumin showed results similar to TSA, indicating that Curcumin de-repressed TFPI-2 through histone acetylation. Reactivation of TFPi-2 inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner as well as cell invasiveness. This data firmly implicates that Curcumin can be used in treatment of HCC due to its ability to reverse epigenetic modifications by reacetylating histone, re-expressing the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene TFPI-2.

HIGH GLUCOSE LEVELS ALTER MORPHINE SIGNALING SYSTEMS: A NOVEL PATHWAY FOR SUGAR ADDICTION
Jan Gong, Charles Yu, 
Garden City High School, Garden City, NY

Sugar intake can alter dopamine production and receptor numbers in animal and human models. However, no prior study has been done on the effect of sugar on both the mu-opioid receptor and its ligand-morphine signaling system, another major pathway linked to drug addiction. In this study, we investigated the effect of glucose on mu-receptor gene expression and activity. A human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line and a neuroblastoma cell line were used in this study. The cells were exposed to 12 mg/ml and 18 mg/ml of glucose and were then harvested for RNA isolation. RT-PCR and cell imaging techniques were used to study the mu-opioid receptor gene expression and activity. Our results showed that gene expression of the mu-opioid receptor was temporally regulated by glucose. We have further found that glucose can significantly stimulate endogenous morphine release. Using a selective opioid receptor antagonist and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, we determined that glucose activated the mu-opioid receptor. This study was the first to demonstrate that sugar has the ability to regulate mu-opioid receptor gene expression and induce significant cell damage and cell death by activating the nitric oxide synthase coupled mu-receptor through endogenous morphine signaling in human cells.

CHARACTERIZATION OF BACE 1 ENDOCYTOSIS
Ruchi Aggarwal, Mehal Shah, 
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the buildup of beta amyloid in the brain. BACE 1 is an essential enzyme for the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which leads to the formation of beta amyloid. Controlling BACE 1 levels will decrease the buildup of beta amyloid, which in turn will reduce the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease-associated pathological lesions in the brain. BACE 1 is thought to cleave APP when both proteins move from the cell surface into the cell. Therefore, in this investigation we studied the endocytosis of BACE 1 in African green monkey (COS) cells. Endocytosis of wildtype BACE 1 and a mutant where the “dileucine motif” has been mutated were studied by labeling BACE 1 and using video microscopy.. The dileucine motif was used in order to provide insight of this trafficking motif on BACE 1 endocytosis. Preliminary data shows that the BACE 1 bearing the dileucine motif significantly decreases the rate of BACE 1 endocytosis compared to wildtype BACE 1. Overall, the outcome of this experiment will provide supplementary knowledge for possible ways to manipulate BACE 1 movement within the neurons and brain beta amyloid levels ultimately reducing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

STUDY THE RADIOSENSITIVITY AND CARRIER'S FREQUENCY OF ATAXIA TALENGECTASIA LIKE DISORDER (ATLD)
Fhad Abdulelah Almusharraf, Ahmed Rashed Alhomai, Abdulaziz Almugairin
Riyadh Schools, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Ataxia telangectasia like disorder (ATLD) is an autosomal recessive inheritance diseases, caused by mutations in Mre11 gene lead to deficiency of MRN complex protein. Clinically, ATLD patients show later onset of the neurological features, and slower progression. Recently, a new missense mutation, a G-to-C change at nucleotide 630 of the Mre11 gene, was described in a group of ATLD Saudi Arabian patients from three unrelated families. Aiming to investigate the cellular radiosensitivity of ATLD fibroblast cell strains against normal radiosensitive control and to assess the heterozygous carriers of G630C mutation in the general population. Cellular radiosensitivity was determined to three cell strains (wild type, ATLD homozygous, ATLD heterozygous), using the clonogenic survival assay. 434 Saudi nationals were studied. The 630 G / C mutation was genotyped by direct sequencing as same as Mre11 C18028T Mre11 C18216G SNPs. Survival curve showed extremely sensitive surviving fraction at 2GY of homozygous ATLD (SF2=0.07) cell strains and normal radiosensitivity for heterozygous ATLD (SF2=0.45) cell strains comparing to wildtype controls (SF2= 0.48).Two individuals with heterozygous G630C mutation were found giving a G/C genotype frequency of 0.5% and a mutant C allele frequency of 0.2%. Survival curves showed that ATLD heterozygote patient with cancer can receive safe and monitored radiation dose for adverse effects to treat their cancers. The allelic frequency indicates the presence of this rare mutation in our population. Premarital, preimplementation, and prenatal screening for Mre11 G630C mutation could be useful to limit the risk of genetic diseases. <br><br>

EVALUATING NOVEL METHODS FOR REVERSING THE DENATURATION PROCESS IN CATALASE
Ban He, Jennifer Spillers, 
Miami HIgh School, Miami, OK

Heat denaturation of catalase enzyme isolated from chicken liver disrupts the hydrogen bonds, stopping all catalase function. This project evaluates novel methods to trigger renaturing of a denatured enzyme. Specifically this project explores the ability of Guanidine-HCl, Urea, cold shock and electric current to reactivate denatured catalase enzyme. Reactivation will be measured by the production of free oxygen by an oxygen probe. The first method approached was based on the recent studies suggesting that Urea and Guanidine-HCl could possibly renature a denatured enzyme. This project also evaluated cold shock treatments which could possibly change the secondary structure of the enzyme causing a potential reactivation. Additionally, a low voltage current will provide shock to the denatured catalase enzyme with Tris/Boric Acid/ Buffer HCl which could produce an electromagnetic force against a friction force (dialysis bag) causing the catalase enzyme to “move” and renature itself. After over 80 trials of preliminary data checking for consistency and accuracy of this novel protocol, six trials of data were collected for each test treatment. The rate of oxygen production in the “renatured” catalase was compared to the rate of oxygen production in the active catalase control group and the control group of denatured catalase. This data suggests that the novel methods of Urea, cold shock and electric current used in this project show promise for potential medical advances for renaturing proteins. Guanidine-HCl showed little effect as a novel treatment (ANOVA p<0.0001).

POLYOL CRYOPROTECTANTS AND ACCLIMATIZATION TO FREEZING
Thomas John Carroll, Zachery Gouveia, 
Somerset High School, Somerset, MA

The overall objective of the experiment was to theorize if it was possible to freeze transplant organs to be thawed and later utilized. This was done in our research by testing different aspects of this theory to test its plausibility. It was hypothesized that acclimation to freezing, freeze tolerance, and polyol accumulation was directly correlated. <br><br> The subjects tested were Periplaneta americana, Lumbricus terrestris, and Gryllinae. They were subjected to increasing periods in the freezer at zero degrees Celsius, and their activity was observed while reviving from freezing using an activity scale. Testing showed that the acclimated insects survived for an average maximum time that was 105.6% longer than the controls. The next part of the experiment was to compare their polyol levels because it is the natural cryoprotectant that certain animals contain that allows their cells to be frozen solid. By using High Performance Liquid Chromatography, the hemolymph of the insects was examined for polyol levels. Evidence of an increase in polyols permitted the testing of the effects of sorbitol, a polyol stimulant, on daphnia. <br><br> The initial experimentation showed that freeze tolerance and acclimation are directly correlated and further investigation suggested that they are also directly correlated to polyol accumulation. <br><br> Backed with this knowledge, it is theorized that it is plausible to artificially stimulate polyol accumulation and therefore to freeze transplant organs to be utilized at a later date.

INDUCING APOPTOSIS IN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS BY ADDING CAPSAICIN AS A MODEL FOR CAPSAICIN'S EFFECT ON CANCEROUS CELLS
Samantha Anne Brokenshire, Devyn Marie Miller, 
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park, TX

Capsaicin was added to embryonic stem cells to determine if it induces apoptosis. Embryonic and cancer stem cells have many similarities, including methods of specialization, of multiplication and of self-renewal. If apoptosis occurs in the experiment with undifferentiated stem cells it can be concluded that the same results could be found if this experiment was performed on cancerous cells meaning that Capsaicin could be a possible treatment for cancer. Experimentation included establishing primary cell culture lines using pluripotent stem cells from chicken embryos. When the medium was changed half of the flasks were fed with a Capsaicin/medium solution and the other half were fed with regular medium. Each successive day, the DNA from both a control and Capsaicin flask was extracted and frozen in a TE buffer solution. After 5 samples were collected, the DNA was run through gel electrophoresis to see if the DNA had fragmented, which would suggest that the cell had undergone apoptosis prior to extraction. Our stem cells underwent natural apoptosis by the 5th day of testing, indicated by the DNA traveling further and smearing on the gels. Some of the cells that were fed Capsaicin reacted differently than others and they were able to survive for different time periods as shown by the variation in the distance they traveled through the gel during electrophoresis. The hypothesis has been rejected because of the variation in data so it is not possible to conclude that Capsaicin causes stem cells to undergo apoptosis.

ANALYZING THE SEPARATE TOXICITY OF ENGINEERED NANOPARTICLES ON L1210 CELLS
Lorne Dean Muir II, Nathan Weeks, 
The Classical Academy, Colorado Springs, CO

The purpose of this investigation is to analyze the separate toxicity of manganese-doped titanium dioxide, barium titanium trioxide, and silver nanoparticles on L1210 cells with flow cytometry. If barium titanium trioxide (BaTiO3), silver (Ag), and manganese-doped titanium dioxide (MnTiO2) nanoparticles are introduced to L1210 mouse leukemia cells, then the molecules Fas and B7.1 will be regulated indicating immunological changes in the cells.<br><br>Testing the toxicity of separate nanoparticles on nanoparticles required several steps. To test the toxicity, L1210 cells were thawed from cryostorage, and then split for further experiments. Then the cells were treated with the nanoparticles using concentrations of 100 ppm, 10 ppm, 1 ppm, and 10 ppb. Fas and B7.1 isotypes and stains were then applied to the cells and placed under the flow cytometer. The cell’s reaction was then analyzed with a flow cytometer to include the granularity, size of the cells, and the fluorescence of the fluorochromes on the antibodies of Fas and B7.1<br><br>The data collected partially supported the original hypothesis. The data did not support the hypothesis because the indicators of B7.1 and Fas did not increase from the controls to the treatments. The data did support the hypothesis because the treatments did cause a higher percentage of death in the cell. MnTiO2, BaTiO3, Ag killed slightly more cells than the no treatment. <br><br>These findings lead us to believe that nanoparticles are toxic to L1210 cells at or above concentrations of 1 ppm. Nanoparticles increase cell death without increasing Fas or B7.1 levels.

THE ROLE OF THE RETINOID X RECEPTOR IN ASTROCYTES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Adriana Elysse Zinn
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

The Alzheimer Disease (AD) brain is characterized by deposition of fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ) resulting from the imbalance between the production and the clearance of soluble Aβ peptides (sAβ). It has been previously shown that microglia treated with a retinoid X receptor agonist, Bexarotene, facilitate intracellular degradation of sAβ. The Liver X Receptor (LXR), along with its obligate heterodimer, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), drives the expression of reverse cholesterol transport genes important for Aβ clearance, including ApoE and the lipid transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. The lipid transporters act to lipidate ApoE. The capacity of ApoE to facilitate Aβ degradation is dependent on ApoE lipidation status. It has previously been shown that microglia treated with Bexarotene promote Aβ degradation by increasing ABCA1, ABCG1, and ApoE expression and by increasing ApoE lipidation status. However, little is known about the role of astrocytes in sAβ degradation. This research aims to ascertain the role of Retinoid X Receptors in astrocytes on Aβ degradation through the similar mechanism seen in microglia. We report that when the astrocytes treated with the RXR agonist, Bexarotene, the protein expression of ApoE, ABCA1 and ABCG1, as well as the lipidation status of ApoE increases. Furthermore, astrocytes treated with Bexarotene facilitated sAβ degradation as measured by ELISA. In conclusion, the role of astrocytes in regulating Aβ in the brain is becoming known.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PINK1 AND DJ1 IN THE PARKINSON'S PATHWAY
Courtney Marie Kloske
Pope John Paul II Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a disorder of the nervous system in the brain and/or in the spinal cord. Two genes in the Parkinson's Pathway, PINK1 (PARK6) and DJ1 (PARK7), are associated with the mitochondria. I set out to determine if the amount of expression PINK1 affects the amount of expression of DJ1. This experiment involves growing shRNA in E. coli, extracting the plasmid, transfecting human cells with the shRNA to knock down PINK1, extracting the mRNA, reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA, and qPCR. The results show that although there seemed to be some impact on DJ1, there is not enough evidence to conclude that PINK1 regulates the expression of DJ1.

IDENTIFYING NOVEL MECHANISMS OF CYTOCHROME-P450 2E1 REGULATION
Nithin Reddy Tumma
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

Cyp2E1 is a vital enzyme involved in the metabolism of many carcinogens within the liver. Cyp2E1 over expression, seen in many pathophysiological condition (diabetes, viral hepatitis, obesity, etc.), is known to increase risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to elucidate mechanisms by which Cyp2E1 disregulation occurs in diabetics. Specifically, the effects of insulin and diabetic medication metformin on Cyp2E1 expression were studied. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with appropriate substances at variable concentrations. Gene and miRNA expression was analyzed through qRT-PCR while protein expression was analyzed with immunoblots. Inhibitors/activators were used to identify functional elements of the regulatory pathway. The expression of miRNA’s linked to the development of cancer was quantified.<br><br>Insulin was shown to decrease Cyp2E1 expression while metformin induced its expression. Insulin mediated regulation was dependant on PI3-Kinase, Akt, AMPK, and mTOR, with evidence that the FOXO proteins were involved. miRNA 212 and 132 were both regulated by insulin (up) and metformin (down). In silico analysis showed significant homology between the regulatory and coding regions of the human and rat gene, supporting extrapolation of data to humans. <br><br>This study provides the first detailed information of the specific mechanisms behind insulin mediated Cyp2E1 regulation and was the first to identify metformin’s effects on Cyp2E1 expression, results with great potential for furthering our understanding of diabetes and its relation to cancer. In addition, insulin and metformin were shown to regulate the expression of miRNA’s related to hepatocellular carcinoma, providing novel evidence that they are involved in epigenetic regulation.

THE HEART OF DRUG REPOSITIONING: TRANSLATING A CARDIOVASCULAR DRUG TO A NOVEL ANTI-CANCER THERAPEUTIC
James Anthony Young
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Every year in America, more than 200,000 men are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, and more than 30,000 men die from this disease. Interestingly, more than eighty percent of prostate cancer-induced deaths result from tumor cells metastasizing to distant sites in the body. While surgery and radiation are common first-line therapies for early disease, safe and effective drugs are needed for the large proportion of men with metastatic prostate cancer. My goal was to reposition approved and marketed drugs from the NIH Clinical Collection drug library as anti-cancer drugs targeting a key metastatic molecular defect: translation initiation. The exceedingly complex process of metastasis involves hundreds of genes; by targeting translation initiation, multiple metastasis-related genes can be hit simultaneously.<br><br> My lead candidate drug, LS1553, is a non-selective beta-blocker currently used to treat heart disease. I verified that LS1553 targeted components of the translation machinery in the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line model. LS1553 inhibited phosphorylated, i.e., activated, eIF4E, 4EBP-1, S6K, and Akt levels, suggesting the molecular target of LS1553 may be upstream of Akt. Additionally, LS1553 significantly inhibited key elements of cancer progression, including proliferation, translationally-regulated VEGF-dependent angiogenesis and other angiogenesis-related cytokines, motility and invasion, and expression of MMP-9, a translationally-regulated metastasis-related protease. Since LS1553 is already FDA-approved, it is a strong candidate for repositioning quickly into clinical practice to treat a variety of cancer types in which protein synthesis is dysregulated.

GENETIC TARGETS IN HPV-INDUCED CANCERS
Arun Brendan Dutta
Western Albemarle High School, Crozet, VA

Cancers target millions of people. I’ve found how to target them back. Human papillomavirus is a virus that causes cancers of the cervix and oral cavity. It uses E6 oncogene to degrade Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase. I closely examined genes whose expression is affected by destruction of Tip60 and sought to discover what effect they have on cellular behavior.<br><br> Of the ten genes that were highly affected in a Tip60/E6 knockdown microarray, four replicated the results in Q-RT PCRs following Tip60/E6 knockdown. Vav-3, AKT2, LMO3, and RUNX1 are all repressed by Tip60 in normal cells and upregulated after HPV-infection. Co-knockdown of Tip60 and E6 showed extreme stimulation in expression of these genes, strongly suggesting that E6 affects expression of these genes through Tip60.<br><br> In addition, I also looked at how protein levels were changed by E6. If a gene is repressed by Tip60 and expressed by E6, then the protein level of that gene should go down following E6 knockdown. Out of four Western blots, only vav-3 and LMO3 antibodies gave strong enough signal for further analysis. Both proteins went up after E6 knockdown, implying that the changes in gene expression translate into changes in protein levels. These findings illuminate a previously unknown mechanism that HPV uses to wrest control of the cell. These genes could be the key to stopping HPV-induced cancers.

MEDDLING WITH RGS17
Jenna Lynne Pappalardo
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Malfunctioning genes in lung cancer allow uncontrolled cancer cell division without eliciting an immune response. The Regulator of G-Protein Signaling 17 (RGS17) is a novel gene that may contribute to cancer’s undetected proliferation via its genetic overexpression. RGS17’s intracellular role is still widely unknown. By downregulating RGS17 in lung cancer via small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, its phenotype can be assessed while understanding its differing functions in cancerous and benign cells. Cyclic AMP is a suspected pathway RGS17 utilizes for prompting propagation.<br><br> A549 non-small cell lung cancer and normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were propagated. RNA levels, protein quantification, cell proliferation, and cAMP regulation were examined for a comprehensive phenotype analysis. Protein extractions and reverse transcription prepared samples for real time PCR which quantified knockdown. Western Blotting was performed to assess the knockdown’s effects on protein levels. RGS17’s intracellular activity was monitored by a cAMP-sensitive assay, while RGS17’s role in cellular metabolic activity was observed with an MTT proliferation assay.<br><br> RT-PCR confirmed transfection success, lowering RGS17 levels in both A549 and NHBE cell lines. GAPDH was effectively visualized with Western Blotting, but inefficiency of the RGS17 antibody led to inadequate visualization. This knockdown did not statistically alter cAMP levels. RGS17 treatment groups in A549 lung cancer showed significantly lower cell metabolic activity than the negative control. These data support RGS17’s role in instigating proliferation in lung cancer and suggest RGS17 could provide earlier detection for lung cancer and provide targeted treatments based on the regulation of this gene.

ROLE OF MYD88 IN DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE
Yiyuan Hu
Hamden High School, Hamden, CT

The myeloid differentiation primary response factor (88) (MyD88) is a critical adaptor protein in the signaling of the innate immune system through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Evidence from this laboratory indicated that expression of DNA damage repair genes was induced by TLR stimulation. To evaluate MyD88’s role in the DNA damage response, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from MyD88 wild-type and MyD88-deficient (knockout) mouse embryos were studied. MyD88 knockout MEFs had less growth when compared to that of wild-type MEFs. Knockout cells were more sensitive to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation than wild-type cells as defined by cell survival seven days following irradiation. Knockout cells also exhibited delayed reentry into mitosis following irradiation. These results suggest an unexpected and novel role for MyD88 in the cellular response and repair of DNA damage. Current experiments include analyses of cell cycle checkpoints and elucidating the interactions between the innate immune and DNA damage responses through flow cytometry, immunoprecipitaion, and Western blot analyses.

ANTICANCER PROPERTY OF MAJOR GOAT MILK FATTY ACIDS AND DELINEATING THEIR MECHANISMS OF ACTION
Amoolya V. Narayanan
Glastonbury High School, Glastonbury, CT

Colorectal cancer, breast cancer and skin cancer are commonly reported cancer types in the US. Although radiations and chemotherapeutic drugs are routinely used to treat cancer, they produce harmful side effects in patients. Additionally, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs has been noticed in cancers. Thus, there is a need for effective and safe molecules for preventing and treating cancers. Natural products from a variety of sources have served as a basis for the development of novel drugs, thereby contributing to human health. The medicinal value of goat milk has been recognized for centuries, and is attributed to three fatty acids, namely capric, caprylic and caproic acids. This research investigated the anticancer property of these fatty acids on human colorectal, skin, mammary gland cancer cells. The cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of fatty acids for 48 hours and cell viability monitored by MTT assay. Additionally, the potential mechanisms behind the anticancer property of three fatty acids was investigated by subjecting mRNA from cancer cells to real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for determining the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis (cell death) genes. Capric, caprylic and caproic acids reduced cell viability of three cancer types by 70 to 90% (P < 0.05) compared to controls. RT-qPCR data indicated that these natural molecules produced anticancer effect by down-regulating cell cycle genes, and up-regulating genes involved in apoptosis. Capric, caprylic, and caproic acids exerted significant inhibitory effect on cancer cells, and future research will validate their anticancer effect in an appropriate in vivo model.

A NOVEL PERFUSION-BASED PROTOCOL FOR DECELLULARIZATION OF ADIPOSE TISSUE ON A BIOREACTOR
Revanth Sai Kosaraju
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

Every year, almost 7000 of the 110,000 organ transplant candidates in the U.S. die while on a waiting list. Tissue engineering has great potential to satisfy the need for replacement organs and to be applied in other clinical venues, such as wound repair. Decellularization is a critical step in the tissue engineering process because it removes cells and cellular antigens that may cause transplant rejection while maintaining an intact extracellular matrix (ECM) and vasculature as a location for stem cell seeding and growth. The use of adipose (fat) tissue is advantageous in that its high degree of vascularization enables long-term tissue viability. None of the existing protocols for adipose tissue decellularization employ perfusion-based methods, which would result in a more thorough decellularization. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel perfusion protocol employing peracetic acid to decellularize adipose tissue on a bioreactor, a perfusion apparatus that maintains physiological conditions ex vivo. In repeated trials (n=3), the decellularization efficacy of this protocol was compared with that of two existing detergent-based protocols using four methods of data analysis: a perfusion test, two histological stainings, and a computer program developed by the researcher for quantitative image analysis. The results indicated that the novel perfusion-based protocol using peracetic acid was the most effective with respect to both ECM and vasculature preservation and uniform and consistent cell removal (mean=73%, range=8%). This novel perfusion-based approach to adipose tissue decellularization holds great potential for successful stem cell seeding, viable organ growth, and ultimately, transplantation.

CORRECTING DYSREGULATED SPLICING OF THE KLF6 GENE IN PANCREATIC CANCER USING MODIFIED ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES
Blake Edward Smith
Oceanside High School, Oceanside, NY

The tumor suppressor KLF6 is a member of the Krüppel-like family of zinc transcription factors, which has been shown to undergo inactivation in pancreatic cancer. Dysregulated splicing of KLF6 increases expression of the oncogenic splice variant KLF6-SV1 and decreases the ratio of wild type KLF6 to SV1. Altering the ratio and overexpressing SV1 contributes to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer, and is therefore a potential target of novel therapeutic treatment of pancreatic cancer. Antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to successfully correct splicing errors by binding to pre-mRNA and altering the formation of mature mRNA. After a preliminary screening of twenty oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide-3 revealed the most significant change on the mRNA levels of wild type KLF6 to SV1 ratio. Additionally, qRT-PCR experiments in the chemoresistant pancreatic cancer cell line, ASPC1, with sequence specific primers indicated significant fold changes in KLF6 and SV1 and restoration of the ratio. Further analysis by MTT viability tests, FACS and Caspase-3 Glo indicated that oligonuceltoide-3 induced spontaneous apoptosis in ASPC1 cells. The use of the FDA approved drug Gemzar in combination with oligonucleotide-3 did not affect splicing in comparison to the use of the oligonucleotide alone. However, the combined use of Gemzar and olgonucleotide-3 exhibited functional biological synergy in overall cell death as indicated by FACS analysis, MTT viability tests and strong Caspase-3 Glo activity. Combined, these studies define a novel therapeutic utilization of antisense oligonucleotide-3 to correct errors in splicing, restore the wild type to SV1 ratio, and thereby increase sensitivity to chemotherapy in chemoresistant pancreatic cancer.

THE EFFECTS OF INDOLEAMINE 2, 3-DIOXYGENASE EXPRESSION ON TUMOR-INDUCED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
Bilal Ahmed Siddiqui
Wellington C. Mepham High School, Bellmore, NY

Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an immunomodulatory enzyme responsible for catalyzing the rate-limiting step of tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway. The depletion of tryptophan and the accumulation of tryptophan metabolites attributed to IDO enzymatic activity inhibit cytotoxic T-cell function by inducing cell cycle arrest, anergy and apoptosis. This presents an impediment to the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This study intended to determine if IDO expression by human melanoma cells is a means of fostering immunosuppression and facilitating cancer metastasis. In turn, the investigation analyzed the effects of IDO expression on leukocyte populations operating in the tumor milieu. Frozen tissue samples were utilized, formerly collected from diverse tumor metastases in melanoma patients. Each tissue type was categorized based on whether or not the originating patient received treatment against CTLA4, a cell surface molecule expressed by activated CD4+ T-cells that transmits inhibitory signals to cytotoxic T-cells. An immunohistochemical staining procedure was performed, applying a monoclonal anti-human IDO antibody to target intracellular IDO expression. Microscopic images were developed using a high-resolution scanner and expression was quantified employing bioanalytical imaging software. The analysis revealed that tumor cells exhibited abnormally augmented levels of IDO expression compared to normal functioning cells. Dynamic expression of the enzyme by cancerous cells stimulates progressive tumor growth by depreciating the quantity of cytotoxic T-cells contiguous to the tumor and down-regulating immune response. Ultimately, this study advocates that blocking the IDO pathway via molecular inhibitors is a potential target for cancer therapies.

CD24 INDUCED MUSCULAR REGENERATION: UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY BEHIND SATELLITE CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Evan M Chen
Wayzata High School, Plymouth, MN

Myogenic differentiation is necessary for muscle recovery after degeneration such as occurs in muscular dystrophy diseases. Muscle regeneration is lacking in such diseases and CD24 has been shown as a marker in regenerative muscles. Unfortunately, its expression has not been officially confirmed or studied in distinct stages of satellite cell progression and function is further less understood. The aim of this study was to reveal if CD24 expression can be confirmed in muscle and satellite cells in early stages of cell progression and to analyze overexpression in CD24 to study its role during muscle differentiation. Immunohistochemical investigation was used to stain single muscle fibers for quiescent satellite cells and to detect MyoD and Pax7 as markers for activated satellite cells in magnetically isolated CD24 positive cells. In order to create exogenous myoblasts with CD24 overexpression, recombinant DNA was necessary to anneal CD24 cDNA with pMXs retroviral vector which were infected into myoblasts and subsequently differentiated. This experiment has revealed that CD24 is not expressed in quiescent satellite cells on single muscle fibers while results obtained through magnetic cell separation columns revealed that CD24 positive cells are co-expressed with MyoD and Pax7 implying that activated satellite cells are CD24 positive. Finally, use of recombinant DNA yielded a 55-60% infection efficiency rate and myosin heavy chain staining has indicated that CD24 overexpressed cells yield a comparably greater number of myotubes differentiated from myoblasts than the negative control. Therefore, this study has established a causational relationship between CD24 and greater differentiation of myoblasts.

SCHIZOPHRENIA SUSCEPTIBLE GENE KCNH2 REGULATES SYNAPTOGENSIS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
Grace Yuan Zhang
Poolesville High School, Poolesville, MD

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by psychosis and other brain dysfunctions, plaguing 1% of the world’s population. Recent studies have recognized a new, abnormal isoform of the potassium channel KCNH2 gene, called KCNH2-3.1, as a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. In schizophrenics, there is a higher expression of the abnormal protein. In my project, I focused on the relationship between an increased expression of the abnormal protein, KCNH2-3.1, and the strength of connections in brain signal transmission. I hypothesized that the overexpression of KCHN2-3.1 in neurons can lead to aberrant synapse development in brain circuitry during neurodevelopment. Using double-immunostaining of post-synaptic density-95 and Synapsin I, by confocal imaging on transfected cortical neurons with KCNH2 isoform cDNAs, I found that the number of matured synapses was significantly decreased by the KCNH2-3.1 overexpression. Furthermore, using Venus, a mutant green fluorescent protein, in vitro, and DiI bullets, in vivo, to see dendritic spine morphology, I found that the KCNH2-3.1 transfected neurons exhibited a significant decrease in mature mushroom spines in vitro and in vivo. These results provide evidence that the KCNH2-3.1 induced alteration in neuronal firing patterns affects synaptogenesis, or synapse formation, in brain circuitry, producing an overall loss in synaptic stability. In addition, my findings may underlie the pathogenesis of schizophrenic symptoms. Hence, regulators of KCNH2-3.1 isoform could be potential drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia in personalized cases.

IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED OLFACTORY RECEPTORS IN THE FEMALES AND MALES OF THE MALARIA VECTOR ANOPHELES SP.
Bruna Favetta
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

As vectors of human diseases, mosquitoes have become a major public health issue. The Anopheles malaria vector relies heavily on olfactory cues to identify its hosts. Better understanding and control of malaria transmission may be achieved through the characterization of olfactory receptors (ORs) responsible for sensing such olfactory cues. Only the female mosquitoes are blood-suckers, suggesting that the ORs used for host-seeking are expressed only in females, not in males. My objective was to identify receptors differentially expressed between the sexes, in order to isolate female-specific ORs that could become biotechnological targets in the control of malaria.<br><br>Anopheles RNA samples were subjected to RT-PCR amplification using a series of degenerate primers, designed based on publicly available Anopheles gambiae OR sequences. I am currently optimizing amplification conditions, and once amplified DNA fragments of the expected sizes are obtained, they will be cloned into plasmids and sequenced. The comparison of expressed sequences between the sexes will lead to the identification of several ORs differentially expressed in females, good candidates for the role of human host recognition in Anopheles.<br><br>The finding of olfactory receptors exclusively or predominantly expressed in female mosquitoes will be followed by functional studies to determine their causal relationship with the process of host-seeking. Also, since the primers used cover only half of the Anopheles OR gene repertoire, other female-specific ORs will be identified in the future by expression analyses on the remaining receptors. Finally, structural studies of these receptors could lead to the design of antagonist ligands to act in the control of host detection, for the prevention of malaria transmission.

WOUND HEALING: THE EFFECT OF ACTIVATED PAF RECEPTOR ON ACTIVATION OF ERK AS INFLUENCED BY GROWTH FACTORS IN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS
Naveen Abdullah Kanji
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

Understanding the bio-chemical pathways involved in wound healing may lead to enhanced wound recovery. This research was done to determine the effect of activated Platelet-Activating Factor Receptor, PAFR on the phosphorylation status of Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase, ERK, a protein necessary for wound healing in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC6). <br><br>Three different growth factors were tested with cPAF to determine which growth factor would most effectively inhibit the dephosphorylation of ERK. IEC6 cells were treated for 30 and 90 minutes with growth factors with or without parallel treatment of cPAF as follows: Control, cPAF; TGFβ; Epidermal Growth Factor, EGF; Insulin-like Growth Factor, IGF; cPAF+TGFβ; cPAF+EGF; and cPAF+IGF. Lysates were collected and probed for total and phosphorylated ERK protein by a standard western blot procedure. For every condition and time point, the ratio of total to phosphorylated protein was quantified by densitometry and normalized to the untreated control. <br><br>The data for this experiment shows that EGF was able to fully recover dephosphorylation of ERK brought upon by activation of PAFR. The data also supports that TGFβ and EGF aid in the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT (preliminary). IGF is unable to aid in the phosphorylation of ERK or AKT suggesting it may help phosphorylation at a shorter time point or that it helps a different member of the MAP kinase pathway.

GENES ON STEROIDS: RNA ACTIVATION-MEDIATED GENE UPREGULATION IN C. ELEGANS
Brian Tshao Do
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, CA

RNA activation (RNAa) is a method of gene upregulation recently discovered as an adjunct to RNA interference (RNAi). Briefly, RNAa involves a short single-stranded RNA (saRNA) binding to a complementary promoter sequence and enhancing gene transcription. RNAa has been demonstrated in humans and mammals. However, RNAa is yet to be identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Since the RNAi pathway is intact in C. elegans, I hypothesized that RNAa would also exist in this worm. Demonstrating the existence of RNAa in C. elegans would provide a simpler model for studying RNAa mechanisms and improving its efficiency for therapeutic use in humans. To study the conservation of RNAa in C. elegans, RNA complementary to a 400-bp promoter sequence of dbl-1, a transcription factor in the body-length pathway, was introduced into wild-type and dbl-1::GFP reporter-expressing C. elegans through feeding. Worms of all larval stages were subsequently assayed for gene expression differences through the measurement of GFP fluorescent intensity. Fluorescence increases of 42% and 52% were observed in worms subjected to RNAa in larval stages L2 and L4, respectively, indicating an increase in dbl-1 expression in these stages. Although the paucity of worms assayed may have hindered the statistical significance of results for L3 and adult worms, these preliminary results show that RNA activation may be conserved in C. elegans. Moreover, it may provide the basis for using C. elegans as a model for further study of RNA activation. Because previous studies have shown that optimally designed, specific saRNA sequences are crucial to successful gene upregulation, future studies will focus on the usage of specific 19-bp saRNAs to mediate RNA activation more effectively.

EFFECT OF MICRORNA-146A ON OSTEOCLAST DIFFERENTIATION
Saaket Milind Pradhan
Dublin Coffman High School, Dublin, OH

The bone is a dynamic tissue that maintains equilibrium by creating bone tissue through osteoblast cells, and resorbing bone tissue through osteoclast cells. The regulation of osteoclast differentiation is critical for normal bone remodeling and in several bone related diseases. CSF-1 and RNKL are two cytokines that direct the differentiation, and modulation of osteoclast function. These two cytokines initiate the intracellular signaling mechanisms leading to the osteoclast specific genes being turned ‘on’ or ‘off’, thereby controlling the production of certain proteins at the right time and in the right quantities during cell differentiation. MicroRNAs (miR) are small non coding RNAs which regulate a range of target protein expression by binding to the mRNA and thus playing a role at the posttranscriptional level. Global miR expression analysis had previously recognized miR-146a as the only miR that was upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Ectopic overexpression of miR-146a in myeloid precursor cells resulted in decreased protein levels of two signaling molecules, TRAF 6 and IRAK 1. miR-146a overexpression also led to attenuated osteoclast differentiation as measured by osteoclast specific markers such as TRAP and Cathpesin K. CHIP experiments performed to analyze the kinetics of miR-146a expression indicated that the regulation of miR-146a by RNKL was different from LPS mediated induction of miR-146a. Collectively, these results propose that the induction of miR-146a is regulated by NF-κB independent pathway and its upregulation in myeloid precursor cells abrogates osteoclast differentiation by downregulation of TRAF6 and IRAK 1. Studying gene silencing mechanisms through miR-146 in osteoclasts could be very important by having applications in bone diseases caused by excessive osteoclast growth such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. By identifying molecular targets in osteoclasts, pharmacological agents that interfere with these specific targets can be designed to fine tune osteoclast differentiation.

THE EFFECT OF VINCRISTINE ON TRANSPOSON MOBILIZATION-INDUCED MUTATION RATES AND SMALL RNA MEDIATED TRANSPOSON SILENCING DURING CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS SPERMATOGENESIS
Smita Shukla
Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science at WPI, Worcester, MA

The chemotherapeutic drug vincristine, a mitotic-inhibitor, was investigated to determine the possibility of alteration to damage caused by transposition in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Based on previous Drosophila melanogaster work, it was anticipated that transposition damage rates would decrease after vincristine consumption due to mitotic-inhibition; indeed, such inhibition may be linked to GTP synthesis, a signal-transduction pathway that may also regulate transposition.<br><br> In order to induce transposition, a transgene containing the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tagged C29 mutated C. elegans strain was developed. In order to determine efficacy of transposon mobilization, the GFP-C29 transgene was injected into individual worm gonads, thereby inducing transposition in F1 generation hermaphrodite progeny. Offspring were fed varying concentrations of vincristine and incubated at 25° Celsius to determine temperature-sensitive sterility (a phenotypic marker of the absence of the C29 gene). The presence of GFP was also assayed to understand transposition location. Using the frequency of small RNA mediated silencing of transposons during C. elegans spermatogenesis, transposon excision was ensured in control nematode groups.<br><br> Student t-tests and averages were determined to understand the statistical significance of all results. As in earlier studies, nematode data suggests that vincristine inhibits transgene recombination, for all vincristine groups are not temperature-sensitive sterile. Such conclusions are useful to researchers currently investigating transposon-based gene therapy models; indeed, such trials now include vincristine as a after-therapy treatment (in order to prevent multiple transposon insertions and subsequent human mutations).

STRAIN-DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF THE MAST CELL-RESTRICTED TRYPTASE MMCP-7: IMPLICATIONS FOR INNATE IMMUNITY, ACQUIRED IMMUNITY, INFLAMMATION, AND BLOOD COAGULATION
Dominick Zheng
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Despite their adverse roles in numerous inflammatory disorders, the tetramer-forming tryptases stored in mouse and human mast cells (MCs) have beneficial roles in blood coagulation, inflammation, and innate and acquired immunity. The focus of this research project was on the tryptase known as mouse mast cell protease-7 (mMCP-7) which prevents internal bleeding in edema sites by proteolytically destroying fibrinogen before it can be converted to fibrin. The mMCP-7 gene was selected for study because it resides on chromosome 17A3.3 at a site that has been linked to altered lung and immune function in different mouse strains.<br><br> A novel 9-mer nucleotide deletion was identified in a previous study that was unique to the mMCP-7 gene in the hyperresponsive A/J mouse strain. Comparative protein modeling methods were then utilized to gain insight into the potential significance of strain-dependent isoforms of the tryptase. The resulting structures predict that the loss of three amino acids in translated A/J mMCP-7 impacts its ability to form dimers and tetramers, thereby impacting its function in immunity, inflammation, and blood coagulation. As a consequence of the compelling protein modeling data, recombinant mMCP-7 isoforms that do and do not express the 3-mer amino acid sequence were successfully generated for future experimental evaluation.<br><br> The accumulated data suggest that strain-dependent mutations in the mMCP-7 gene can have profound biologic consequences. It is anticipated that the information gained from this study will lead to a better understanding of the functional consequences of similar allelic variations in the corresponding hTryptase-beta gene.

TARGETING AMP KINASE TO REVERSE CISPLATIN RESISTANCE IN OVARIAN CANCER
Shree Bose
Fort Worth Country Day, Fort Worth, TX

Each year, over 21,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women the United States. Beginning as an uncontrolled proliferation of mutated cells, ovarian cancer grows into a malignant tumor, then metastasizing to other parts of the body. Currently, the leading ovarian cancer treatment is chemotherapy, where patients are treated with chemicals to eradicate the cancerous cells. <br><br>One of the most common drugs used in ovarian cancer chemotherapy is cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy treatment. Cisplatin damages DNA by crosslinking until the cellular repair functions activate apoptosis when repair proves impossible. While the drug does affect ordinary cells, the significantly higher replication frequency of cancer cells causes cisplatin to have a greater impact on malignant cells. However, cancer cells often develop resistance to cisplatin, rendering the treatment ineffective and leading to a relapse in patients. To improve the effectiveness of cisplatin treatment, the mechanism by which cancer cells resist cisplatin must be determined. <br><br>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme which maintains cellular energy levels by regulating the ATP:AMP ratio of a cell. Through testing both resistant and sensitized ovarian cancer cells, it was observed that AMPK inhibition has different effects on cell death induced by cisplatin treatment in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells. By using flow cytometry, cell staining, and western blotting techniques, this experimentation provides proof that AMPK plays a role in the development of resistance to cisplatin - a conclusion which may hold great potential for alternative ovarian cancer chemotherapy.

EFFECTS OF BLOODROOT ON CANDIDA ALBICANS MORPHOLOGY AND GROWTH
Daniel Walter Beierwaltes
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

Bloodroot is a perennial flowering plant native to North America that has been used as an anti-microbial and an anti-plaque agent for many centuries, dating back to the Native Americans. Bloodroot is added to creams, lotions, and toothpastes as a herbal antimicrobial remedy. C. albicans is diploid fungi (form of yeast) that causes various diseases including thrush. The elderly and very young are especially susceptible. There are two forms of C. albicans-budded and hyphal. About 80% of albicans are budded, however, in response to environmental signals they will change the forms (budded to hyphal), which causes the infections. We tested whether a Bloodroot tincture (extract) and a Bloodroot salve have anti-fungal activity at various concentrations. The tincture was cytotoxic at all concentrations tested except 2.5µL per 1ml. The salve induced hyphal growth instead of inhibiting, which was the exact opposite of the manufacturer’s intention. This suggests that depending on the formula of the creams, lotions, and toothpastes bloodroot could help a fungal infection or make it worse.

INTER-ALPHA-TRYPSIN INHIBITOR HEAVY CHAIN 4 PROMOTES LUNG INJURY BUT INHIBITS CELL MIGRATION POST ENDOTOXIN EXPOSURE
Greeshma Somashekar
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4) is a protein, synthesized and secreted by the liver, that is found in heart and lung tissue. The serum concentration of ITIH4 is highly elevated in acute phase processes. ITIH4 is of interest as its expression is enhanced in the sera of patients with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, ITIH4 binds to actin in polymorphonuclear cells and inhibits phagocytosis. I therefore hypothesized that ITIH4 is an important gene in the lung response to environmental injury and used an endotoxin-induced model of inflammation in mice to evaluate my hypothesis. Tissue from wild-type control mice (ITIH4+/+) were compared were compared to tissues from specially bred mice lacking the gene for ITIH4 (ITIH4-/-).<br><br> Immunohistochemical characterization was performed on cells in alveoli and bronchi to determine the exact location of ITIH4. Injury was assessed by comparing protein levels and images of tissue. Subsequently, cytokine levels, cell counts, and neutrophil migration were quantified. Compiled data revealed that lung injury, protein levels, KC, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) were elevated in ITIH4+/+ mice, whereas total cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in ITIH4-/- mice. This disconnect in data was explained by migration assay results, which indicated that ITIH4 presence, both intracellular and in serum, inhibits migration. The novel physiological function of ITIH4 in the lung was determined: ITIH4 promotes lung injury/inflammation and the following humoral response, but inhibits inflammatory cell migration.

DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW COST ELECTROPORATOR FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND DEVELOPING WORLD APPLICATIONS
Timothy D. Trippel
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Molecular biology is a scientific discipline that has been rapidly expanding due to the development of a few major technologies. One of these technologies is the ability to transform organisms, specifically using electroporation. Transformation is the process by which foreign genetic material (typically DNA) is taken up by a recipient cell. Electroporators are devices used to artificially insert genetic material into cells. Scientists artificially transform cells in order to alter their genetic makeup. Commercial grade electroporators are expensive (usually costing between $5,000 and $10,000), require extensive infrastructure, single-use parts, and power supplies to operate. The goal of this project was to design, build, and implement an open-source electroporator for approximately $20 in parts, making it suitable for molecular biology experimentation in cost-sensitive environments. I hypothesized that a self-powered, reusable, and self-sterilizing electroporator could be developed for approximately $20 in parts. Circuit schematics for an electroporator were designed, built, and tested using simple cloning experiments. The electroporator successfully transformed E. coli (DH5alpha) with pBluescript (a plasmid DNA), and was built using commercially available parts totaling approximately $25. Making enabling technologies, like electroporation, open-source and inexpensive will facilitate the expansion of molecular techniques to scientists and students in cost-sensitive environments, creating opportunities for independent accomplishment in molecular biology.

ARE FINGERPRINT PATTERNS INHERITED?
Briana Leigh Duer-Sandoval
Salinas High School, Salinas, CA

We can often tell that two people are siblings because they appear to have several similar physical traits. This is because children receive half of their DNA from each parent. All biological siblings are the mixture of both parents' DNA. This results in a greater degree of matching traits between siblings than between unrelated individuals. Therefore, if DNA determines fingerprint patterns, then siblings are more likely to share the same fingerprint pattern type than two unrelated pairs. Fingerprints have a general flow to the ridges that translates into one of three major pattern tpyes: arch, loop, or whorl. If the primary ridges appear while the volar pad is still quite pronounced (a characteristic described as a high volar pad), then the individual will develop a whorl pattern. If the primary ridges appear while the volar pad is less pronounced (dubbed an intermediate volar pad), then the individual will develop a loop pattern. Finally, if the primary ridges appear while the volar pad is nearly absorbed (a so-called low volar pad), the individual will develop an arch pattern. <br><br> I wanted to determine if fingerprint patterns are inherited by comparing the fingerprint patterns of related siblings to those of unrelated pairs. I gathered the fingerprint patterns of twelve sets of siblings and twelve sets of unrelated participants. Each participant's right index finger was fingerprinted using a black ink pad and card. Each pattern was then categorized and recorded as an arch, loop, or whorl. I found that nine out of the twelve related siblings fell into the same fingerprint pattern category. Only three out of the twelve unrelated pairs fell into the same fingerprint category. Therefore it can then be accepted that fingerprint patterns are inherited.

KINETICS OF MYOGLOBIN AND HEMOGLOBIN PH RENATURATION
Stephanie Lynn Pitman
Homeschool, Frankfort, IN

Many neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are caused by protein misfolding within the cells of the body. To better understand how proteins fold incorrectly and how they can be treated, it is first necessary to study the fundamentals of how basic proteins fold correctly. The goal of my experiments was to examine the molecular interactions in the renaturation of myoglobin and hemoglobin during pH jumps (from pH 7.0 to 3.0 and back to 7.0) using spectrophotometry. My hypothesis was that the activation energy of hemoglobin would be much greater than that of myoglobin due to its size and intersubunit salt bridges.<br><br>My experimental procedure consisted of using a spectrophotometer to run spectrums of myoglobin (0.25 mg/ml) at 5 different temperatures (18°C, 23°C, 28°C, 33°C, and 38°C). The hemoglobin experiments (0.25 mg/ml) were run at 4 different temperatures (18°C, 22°C, 27°C, and 32°C). The results of each were then put into an Arrhenius graph with statistical analysis. The statistical analysis provided 95% upper and lower confidence limits for both the myoglobin and hemoglobin average ln(k) trendlines as well as the standard deviations. <br><br> <br><br>My results did not support my hypothesis. Rather, the statistical data showed the difference in the renaturation rate of the two proteins to be statistically insignificant. It made it impossible to say for certain if the activation energies were different from each other. This in addition to the speed of the reaction and the lack of a significant temperature dependence leads to a conclusion that both myoglobin and hemoglobin only undergo ionizational changes, not large conformational changes within the pH range tested.

EFFECTS OF CHEMOATTRACTANT LEUKOTRIENE B4 IN NEUTROPHIL RESPONSE TO CUSO4 INDUCED WOUNDING
Maya Pema Dorje
James Madison Memorial High School, Madison, WI

Neutrophils, the most abundant type of white blood cell, are the first responders to sites of infection, releasing antimicrobial proteins, reactive oxygen species and engulfing harmful bacteria and antigens through phagocytosis. However, when neutrophils accumulate and stay at the site of infection for prolonged periods of time during uncontrolled inflammation, they inflict damage on healthy body tissue. Through the optical transparency of zebrafish(Danio rerio) embryos, neutrophils have been observed to travel to the wound site and enact reverse migration in the process of resolving inflammation. Understanding the main signaling pathways responsible for neutrophil wound attraction and resolving may provide insight in the pathogenesis of neutrophil disorders. To investigate the metabolic pathways involved in neutrophil resolution, an assay using CuSO4 neuromast wounding in zebrafish was established and used to test the effect of Leukotriene B4(LTB4), a neutrophil chemoattractant produced by neutrophils. High neutrophil recruitment at 30 minutes and resolution at 4 hours was observed through a fixed time course using Sudan Black Staining, and fluorescent live imaging. The role of LTB4 was tested by using Bestatin, an inhibitor of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) that catalyzes the production of LTB4 from Leukotriene A4(LTA4), and by using U75302, an LTB4 receptor antagonist. Results demonstrated that reducing LTB4 activity with U75302 does not affect neutrophil resolution or recruitment; however, inhibiting LTA4H significantly increases the number of neutrophils at 4 hours.

TLR3-MEDIATED SIGNALING PROTECTS ASTROCYTES AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS THROUGH SOD2 UPREGULATION
Swetha Krishna Doppalapudi
Morgantown High School, Morgantown, WV

Viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), can cause brain pathologies known as viral encephalitides, which are associated with high mortality and severe morbidity. Astrocytes, the most abundant brain cells, are the primary targets of HSV1. Existing evidence implicates Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as the receptor critical for neuroprotection against HSV1. TLR3, the innate immune receptor involved in antiviral response, is highly expressed and inducible in astrocytes. Therefore, astrocytic TLR3 is of a great importance for the pathogenesis of HSV-1-induced encephalitis. Because the viral infection invariably induces oxidative stress, the present study was undertaken to evaluate whether TLR3 singling is also involved in antioxidant protection. Cultured human brain astrocytes were challenged with the TLR3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC; 50 µg/ml) for 24 h. Following a medium change, cells were grown for 48 h, and then subjected to oxidative stress by exposure to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide for 90 min. After 24 h, cell survival was evaluated by counting live cells. Under these experimental conditions approximately 70% of control cells (not challenged with PIC) died due to oxidative stress, whereas only 10% of PIC pretreated cells were affected. Evaluation of the expression of 15 genes involved in the antioxidative response showed a marked upregulation of Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) mRNA and protein expression after TLR3 ligation. Pretreatment of astrocytes with conditioned medium from PIC-challenged astrocytes also provided antioxidative protection. Taken together, these results indicate that TLR3 ligation induces resistance to oxidative stress through an autocrine signaling loop(s) and SOD2 upregulation.

NOVEL ROLE OF BAT3 IN REGULATION OF BASAL MACROAUTOPHAGY
Ishan Chatterjee
Fox Chapel Area High School, Pittsburgh, PA

Part of the challenge facing conventional cancer treatments today is the ability of cancer cells to resist chemotherapy. This study aims to elucidate the autophagic role of Human leukocyte antigen-B associated transcript 3 (BAT3) in cancer cells. BAT3, a Major Histocompatability Complex Class III protein, can induce apoptosis in some contexts, but its effect on autophagy is unknown. Autophagy is the degradation of damaged or superfluous cellular components, and has recently been implicated as a critical cancer cell survival mechanism. Though basally active to maintain homeostasis, autophagy increases under enhanced cellular stress, preventing apoptosis. Under constant stress, established tumors have high levels of autophagy, leading to chemotherapy resistance. Consequently, suppression of autophagy allows cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.<br><br> HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines were infected with a lentiviral shRNA to knockdown expression of BAT3. Clones were assayed for BAT3 protein expression by imaging cytometry. Additionally, to evaluate the response of BAT3 positive and negative cells to autophagy, the cells were stressed and LC3 punctae formations were enumerated.<br><br> I found that BAT3 regulates basal autophagy (ANOVA, p < 0.01) and correlates with LC3 expression. However, in the case of stressed cancer cells, BAT3 regulation of autophagy was inconclusive. Further research will study the role of BAT3 suppression in carcinogenesis and the effectiveness of BAT3 suppression as a method to inhibit autophagy in chronically stressed cancer cells, thereby weakening tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy.

HEADS OR TAILS? THE REGENERATION OF PLANARIA
Rachel DiCioccio
Clinton High School, Clinton, NY

I became fascinated with Planaria through an in-class lab and decided that I wanted to learn more. My experiment was based upon a single bisection cut of a Planarian. I separated the head from the tail and my purpose was to see which portion of the Planarian's body regenerated itself at a faster rate. Would the piece of tail needing to regenerate a head grow faster, or would the head in need of a tail? My hypothesis was that the tail would regenerate faster.<br><br>First off, I obtained all of the materials needed to perform the experiment. Once I separated the head and tail of my first Planarian I recorded data every day at lunch.I measured the Planarian growth with the stereo microscope and a clear ruler. Checking daily, I recorded notes on the growth and actions of each Planarian. I performed two trials.<br><br>After 14 days for each trial I came to the conclusion that the Planaria which had heads and needed tails, regenerated at a faster pace than those in need of the head. I wholly understand why this is correct, as the anterior of Planaria has less neoblasts, which aid in the regenerating process. Without as many of these stem cells it takes much more time.

WAKE UP CALL – IS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ON THE LINE?
Michael C Godwin
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

This study was performed to see if there was a difference between C-Reactive Protein levels in adolescents ages 14-18 who sleep with their cell phones and/or electronic devices and are sleep disrupted, compared to adolescents who are not sleep disrupted via any electronic use. One-hundred sleep surveys were administered randomly throughout Andrews High School Science hall. Students were asked to fill out the survey to the best of their ability. Twenty-eight adolescents were chosen for the control group (Sleepers)and fify-one adolescents were chosen for the experimental group (e-Disturbance) based on their survey results. Students were asked to give a 1mL sample of saliva via passive drool and instructed not to eat or drink anything an hour prior to collection. Analysis was conducted on adolescents' saliva using a Salivary C-Reactive Protein ELISA assay and showed a significant difference in "e-Distrubance" group when compared to the "Sleepers" group. These results may further indicate adolescents whose sleep is disrupted via cell phone or electronic device may become more prone to long- or short-term cardiovascular events.

IMPACT OF TUNA OVARIES ON SHRIMP MATURATION FEED
Abraham Kwan
Moanalua High School, Honolulu, HI

Shrimp aquaculture is a large and expensive industry. A significant amount of the cost comes from the maturation feed given to the shrimp. The long chain omega-6 fatty acids are important for growth in shrimp. Bloodworms are currently used as maturation feed for shrimp. Tuna ovaries are currently a waste product in the fish industry. The fatty acid components of tuna ovaries were analyzed as a possible source of maturation feed for shrimp. Freeze dried samples of tuna ovaries were extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography to determine the breakdown of fatty acids. The unknown peak areas of each fatty acid were determined by using the retention time on a FAME Standard. A high tuna ovary arachidonate to eicosapentaenoate ratio is an indicator for good shrimp maturation diet. Student’s t-test was used to in data analysis to compare fatty acid components of tuna ovaries versus bloodworms. It was determined that all tuna ovary samples had a higher arachidonate to eicosapentaenoate ratio as compared to bloodworms. This information could be used to manipulate the ARA:EPA ratio of the feed in combination with the bloodworms. The data from this experiment is being sent back to the University of Guam to be tested on live shrimp to verify if the tuna ovaries are a better maturation feed for shrimp. The tuna ovaries are a lot cheaper than bloodworms and they also have a higher ARA:EPA ratio to help with the maturation of shrimps.

DEPENDENCE OF GFP-GST FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSION ON IPTG CONCENTRATION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Michael Florea
Tallinn Secondary Science School, Tallinn, Harju, ESTONIA

This research project studies the correlation between IPTG concentration and GFP-GST fusion protein expression in an expression system consisting of E.coli BL21(DE3) and plasmid pET42. The objectives of the study were formulated as follows: <br><br>1) To determine the best IPTG concentration for total protein production.<br><br>2) To determine the concentration, with which the production of biologically active GFP would be the greatest.<br><br> In the experiments, cultures with IPTG concentration ranging from 0,1mM/l to 1mM/l were used, as well as a test culture without IPTG. During a 22 hour period, growth rate and fluorescence of the cultures were measured. Additionally, protein electrophoresis was carried out to measure the amount of inactive GFP.<br><br> The data gathered from the experiments demonstrated, that even though the intensity of GFP production in 1mM/l culture was high, the high metabolic stress arising from intensive production resulted in the lowest growth rate. Surprisingly, the highest production rate of both total and biologically active GFP was measured in 0,1mM/l culture. The percentage of inclusion bodies though, was considerable in all cultures. These initial findings indicate, that for both mass production and laboratory use, lower concentrations of IPTG are better suited. Also, when using GFP in prokaryotic cells for quantitative measurements, the existence of inclusion bodies must be taken into consideration. <br><br> Given that in recent years GFP has become an extremely important tool in biotechnology and, that it has the potential to go beyond research, it is vital to determine the best conditions for its expression. Knowing the concentrations are necessary to obtain accurate results in GFP-using studies, as well as to optimize future massproduction of GFP.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF TP53 CODON G72C POLYMORPHISM IN GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO CERVICAL CANCER
Mohammed Abdulrahman Alsobay
Diplomatic Quarter High School, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the twelfth most common neoplaisa in Saudi Arabian women, versus third worldwide. Inherent tendency to develop cancer has been suggested to be related to single-nucleotide polymorphic variation (SNPs). SNPs in genes involved in pathways related to cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis have been suggested to affect genetic predisposition to cervical cancer. A strong candidate for this relation is a common G/C polymorphism at codon 72 of TP53 that results in an arginine to proline change in the amino acid sequence of the encoded p53 protein. <br><br> This study investigated the association between the TP53 G72C polymorphism and the risk of developing cervical cancer in 339 Saudi women. DNA was extracted from 5ml whole blood, and the relevant DNA segment was amplified by polymerase chain reactions sequenced, and TP53 G72C genotyped. A statistically significant association (P = 0.03) between the TP53 G72C SNP and cervical cancer occurred. The variant C/C genotype showed increased risk to develop cervical cancer. At 5% significance level for 1 degree of freedom, the genotype frequencies of the control group were out of the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (chi-squared = 9.6), while that of the patients were within Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (chi-squared = 0.41). <br><br> We conclude that TP53 G72C polymorphism is associated with cancer predisposition and the variant C/C genotype increases twofold the risk of developing cervical cancer in Saudi females. This may uncover more polymorphic variations that can be used as applicable biomarkers.

UNPRECEDENTED LETHAL EFFECT ON TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS BY A COMBINATIONAL THERAPY INTERFERING WITH THE PURINE SALVAGE OF THE PARASITE
Mahmoud Motaz Ghulman
Dar Al Thiker school, Jeddah, Makkah, SAUDI ARABIA

Trichomonas vaginalis is a parasite that causes a common, sexually transmitted disease with a worldwide impact. Infection can predispose to HIV infection and other serious health consequences. Purines are essential for all living organisms to the constitute nucleic acids. T. vaginalis lacks de novo purine synthesis and has to salvage it from host. Therefore, salvage pathways should be eminent targets to chemotherapeutic strategies. The project aims to introduce a novel rationally-designed combinational therapy (Dipyridamole, and Allopurinol) targeting purine salvage pathways of T. vaginalis. Growth inhibition assays were performed to evaluate the effect of the novel drugs on a culture of T. vaginalis trophozoites in TYM medium. Dipridamole/allopurinol combination shows almost complete parasite growth inhibition (98.8%) compared to individual drugs (63.6% & 77.3% respectively) and to the traditional drug; metronidazole (67.1%). This dipyridamole/allopurinol inhibitory effect, in culture, is not expected to be reproduced in vivo due to expected poor bioavailability at the infection site as well as high plasma protein binding. The project’s results represent the first ever to raise the concept of targeting purine salvage pathways –in Trichomonas vaginalis- as a possible line of treatment. They pave the road to test the suggested chemotherapeutic regimen on other purine-auxotroph microorganisms. Future work on using nanotechnology-based methods such as nanocapsulation is expected to provide better delivery in biological systems.

GENERATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-ALPHA
Sachin Jain
Homestead High School, Fort Wayne, IN

Recombinant human estrogen receptor-alpha protein (rhER-alpha) is used 1) as a probe for a patented evanescent biosensor (1), 2) as a reagent in a 3-tier test for assessing the presence and properties of estrogen mimics (2), and 3) as a reference standard for studies of a novel ERE-binding protein. To improve the yield and quality of rhER-alpha, we altered growth and extraction procedures in the yeast expression protocol. Using an expression plasmid containing the ubiquitin-fused hER-alpha gene (3), yield of total protein was constant from 1-4 hours after induction. To assess the presence of rhER-alpha, Western Blotting was performed using 5D11 monoclonal antibody, and a major band was observed at 66 kDa. Using identical media, we tested the influence of yeast culture flasks designs (no baffles, side baffles, center baffles, both side and center baffles). Similar total protein yields were obtained, and rhER-alpha bands exhibited the same migration pattern. Extraction under different conditions, e.g., with glass beads or with detergents, indicated use of glass beads gave the best results. Data showed that the total protein extracted under control conditions (glass beads) was significantly higher as compared to using the sarcosine and lauroyl-sarcosine detergents. Triton X and IGEPAL yielded similar amounts of total protein as the control. No rhER-alpha was detected on Western Blots when detergents were used. When Western Blots showed full length rhER-alpha , the activity of rhER-alpha was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Collectively, results suggest rhER-alpha with known migration properties and ERE-binding activities was enhanced.

PLASMIDS FOR PROSTATE CANCER: CONSTRUCTION OF SINGLE CHAIN VARIABLE FRAGMENTS (SCFV) F77 FOR PROSTATE CANCER MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THERAPY RESEARCH
Gabriela Isla-Inez Canales
The Good Hope School, Fredriksted, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Prostate Cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men.. A special monoclonal antibody called mAbF77 has shown to be successful in finding and killing prostate cancer cells. The antibody can be expressed via construction of a plasmid. The purpose of this project is to create two plasmids that will be used for further research involving the humanization of monoclonal antibody F77 by expressing the antibody. There were a variety of different methods used to construct these plasmids. The methods included ligating the VH4 insert to the vector, ligating the VL2 insert, the VH4 insert, and the vector all at one time, and ligating the VL2 and VH4 inserts together to make a double insert, later ligating that double insert to the vector. The methods that showed success in building the constructs involved the construction of a double insert. To make this insert, the VH4 and VL2 inserts were ligated with the help of a linker, which made them compatible. They were later ligated to the vector (pIT2 or PET21d). Through the process of trial and error, the two plasmids were eventually constructed. The plasmids were named pIT2-ScFvF77 and PET21d-ScFvF77. Future studies involving the plasmids include those relating to the humanization of monoclonal antibody F77. The PET21d-ScFvF77 plasmid will be used for protein purification, while the pIT2-ScFvF77 plasmid will be used for affinity maturation. Future studies involving the plasmids also include those in the area of diagnosis. Nano-particles, which can be detected on an MRI machine, will be linked to the antibody. Then, when the antibody tracks down the prostate cancer, the MRI will show exactly where the prostate cancer is located, leading to a less invasive way of diagnosing prostate cancer.

INTERACTIONS AMONG P53, BRCA1, ESTROGEN AND TGF-BETA AS RISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER
Emma Jean Graham
Elmwood School, Ottawa, CANADA

In this project the effects of several genetic and chemical risk factors at inducing Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), that is the transition of anchored epithelial cells to migratory mesenchymal cells, was studied. Their effect on stem cell formation in mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSE) was also observed. The first objective was aimed at determining the role of the tumour suppressors P53 and BRCA1, as well as the role of exogenous estradiol and TGF-beta in EMT initiation. The second objective was to determine the efficacy of certain combinations of genetic and chemical factors at influencing the risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer. Finally, research was done to determine if cells that have undergone EMT exhibit a cancer stem cell genotype. It was found that P53, BRCA1, estradiol and TGF-beta all play a role in EMT initiation. Out of the combinations tested, it was found that the combination of P53 inactivation, estrogen exposure and TGF-beta exposure holds the most risk for epithelial ovarian cancer development in women, whilst normal MOSE cells exposed to estradiol holds the least. It is unclear whether EMT directly causes stem cell formation, however inactivating BRCA1 and treatment of exogenous estradiol greatly increases stem cell characteristics in MOSE cells. This research shows that several unrelated risk factors induce an identical change of characteristics in MOSE cells, therefore suggesting a process by which risk factors lead to ovarian cancer initiation. This research also has applications in the development of an early detection method for ovarian cancer, namely the detection of mesenchymal cells in the blood. This research provides a possible explanation of why older women may be more susceptible to ovarian cancer

IDENTIFICATION OF EZRIN AS A COLONIC SUBSTRATE FOR PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE SIGMA
Howard Feng
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, Ontario, CANADA

Protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma) is a transmembrane receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This enzyme contains several extracellular domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane stretch, and two intracellular phosphatase domains, D1 and D2, of which the D1 domain is catalytically active. PTP sigma is encoded by the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S (Ptprs) gene. Previous research using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis demonstrated PTP sigma’s association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ptprs-knockout mice spontaneously exhibit symptoms similar to human IBD. Although the genetic association of PTPRS and IBD has been identified, the role of PTP sigma in the development of IBD is unknown. <br><br>As the first step in understanding the role of PTP sigma in IBD, it was critical to identify colonic PTP sigma substrates. A list of putative substrates was previously generated using a phospho-tyrosine screen on PTP sigma-knockout mouse colon tissue and served as a guide for experimentation. In this research, a substrate trapping assay was performed, revealing that the cytoskeletal linker protein, ezrin, was able to bind to the D1 domain of PTP sigma in vitro. Furthermore, a phosphatase activity assay and an in vitro dephosphorylation assay confirmed the catalytically active D1 domain can directly dephosphorylate ezrin in vitro. These results strongly suggest that ezrin is a colonic substrate for PTP sigma. <br><br>Ezrin plays an essential role in organizing proteins at the apical membrane and prior studies have indicated ezrin is related to epithelial barrier defence, which could be associated with IBD. Characterization of colonic PTP sigma substrates will greatly aid in understanding connections between PTP sigma and IBD.

DETERMINING THE ROLE OF THE HUR PROTEIN IN THE GENETIC EXPRESSION OF INTERLEUKIN-3 IN HUMAN CELLS
Ruben Octavio Garcia-Vazquez
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

IL-3 belongs to a group of chemical messengers that harbor adenine and uridine-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'-untranslated regions (3`-UTR). AREs presence has been related to the regulation of protein synthesis and mRNA stability. Previous studies have shown that AREs in the IL-3 3 `-UTR induce a translational repression in a luciferase reporter. In addition, it has been found that HuR protein recognized the IL-3 ARE. Based on these observations, the goal of this study was to determine the role of HuR protein in regulating the IL-3 ARE mediated post-transcriptional regulation in human cells. Can HuR protein affect IL-3 expression by over-expressing its protein levels in human cells? The central hypothesis of this project was that the HuR protein has a negative role in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-3 in human cells. To test this hypothesis, HuR levels were increased by over-expressing the HuR protein. The effects of HuR over-expression in the regulation of a firefly luciferase reporter containing the IL -3 3 'UTR was monitored. According to the results obtained, HuR over-expression decreases the expression of the luciferase reporter containing the IL-3 3 'UTR in human cells. This statistically significant decrease is approximately 1.5 times lower. Moreover, HuR over-expression results showed a decrease in the reporter mRNA levels that contain the IL-3 3`UTR. These results favored the central hypothesis. The results obtained during this study will serve as a preamble to new cancer therapeutic strategies.

DIRECT VISUALIZATION OF SINGLE HYPOXIC TUMOR CELL INVASION AND INTRAVASATION IN MAMMARY TUMORS
Haoxuan Wang
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

Understanding how cancer cells spread to other parts of the human body can provide important insights and will ultimately translate into improved diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches. "TMEM" (tumor microenvironment of metastasis) density is associated with the development of distant organ metastasis of breast cancer. Published studies suggest links between tumor hypoxia (severe oxygen deprivation) and each component of TMEM (namely invasive breast cancer cells, tumor associated macrophages, and tumor blood vessels). However, until now there was no direct observation of how these multiple parties interact under hypoxia condition, and promote hematogenous metastasis. In current study, I have created tumor cell lines with red fluorescence protein (TagRFP) as the reporter for tumor hypoxia. I theorized an in vivo xenograft model which was then developed in the animals by the laboratory staff. I then validated the model on tissues taken from the animals and have proven TagRFP expression can accurately report tumor hypoxia by three means: QRT-PCR, fluorescent microscopy, and Immunohistochemistry analysis. Finally, I have demonstrated that this system, when combined with superb spatial resolution of multiphoton imaging, is a valuable tool for studying microscopic tumor hypoxia distribution and its role in the tumor invasion and intravasation. In particular I have obtained evidence, at single cell resolution, that hypoxic tumor cells migrate and associate with blood vessels thereby contributing to intravasation.

IS MITOCHONDRIA-TARGETED ANTIOXIDANT SS31 A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?
Tejaswini Parlapalle Reddy
Merlo Station High School-School of Science and Technology, Beaverton, OR

The purpose of this study was to investigate if a small, mitochondria-targeted peptide known as SS31 could be a potential therapeutic drug for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Several therapeutic approaches have been studied for the treatment of AD, but targeted antioxidants such as SS31 peptide seem most promising. <br><br> AD transgenic tissue treated with phosphate buffered saline and SS31 peptide were used for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry analyses. <br><br> Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed decreased levels of AB as well as BACE1 in SS31 treated amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) tissue compared to control APP tissue. Further, mitochondrial fission proteins were downregulated and fusion proteins were upregulated in SS31 treated APP tissue. Significant increase in levels of presynaptic protein synaptophysin in SS31 treated APP tissue compared to control APP tissue, indicating that SS31 enhances synaptic branching and activity. These findings also suggest that SS31 decreases AB levels, prevents mitochondrial fragmentation, promotes healthy mitochondria, and increases needed synaptic activity. Further, AB degrading enzyme, NEP, was present more in SS31 treated APP tissue. Overall, these findings suggest that SS31 prevented AB toxicity, which warrants the study of SS31 as a therapeutic drug to treat patients with AD.

RAB14 REGULATES TIGHT JUNCTION INTEGRITY AND POLARITY IN EPITHELIAL CELLS
Kelsey Maura Waite
Tucson Magnet High School, Tucson, AZ

Recently, small GTPases such as the Rab subfamily have been a major subject of interest because they control many membrane trafficking pathways in the cell. In epithelial cells, the proper sorting and recycling of membrane proteins is crucial in cell polarity and the formation of cellular junctions, which are responsible for the passage of macromolecules through the epithelium. Previous research has suggested that increased intestinal permeability due to impaired tight junction structure may cause serious health effects such as Crohn’s Disease. It has previously been shown that that Rab14 is involved in the delivery of specific apically targeted proteins from the Trans-Golgi network to the apical domain. The goal of this study was to determine the role of Rab14 in the formation and integrity of epithelial tight junctions as well as determine its role in cell polarity. Mutation of Rab14 to the inactive form results in more rapid formation of junctions after calcium switch suggesting that Rab14 is a negative regulator of tight junction integrity. Additionally, expression of inactive Rab14 results in defects in polarity as shown by failure to form cysts in 3-dimensional culture, underscoring the relationship between tight junction assembly and cell polarity.

EXPLORING POSSIBLE TREATMENTS OF EPILEPSY USING AN ANIMAL MODEL
William Davis Haselden
Mountain Brook High School, Mountain Brook, AL

Using a rat model with a kainate induced seizure, I sought to determine how select gene dysregulation may contribute to the epilepsy Phenotype. In this study, I sought to determine the expression pattern of DNMT3a and DNMT3b genes during epileptogenesis. I chose genes that may be epigenetically regulated or genes that control the DNA methylation pattern. Three time points have been assessed for mRNA expression patterns, status epilepsticus, the latency period, and the epileptic stage. Gene expression was assessed in 3 subregions of the hippocampus, a part of the brain where seizures are often generated.<br><br>For these experiments, I first performed a cDNA synthesis, where mRNA is converted to DNA. Following this, I added primers to the genes of interest in a preamplification step so as to conserve the sample and allow for consistent comparison of genes of interest with control genes. I then used Real-Time PCR to measure the expression levels of the mRNA genes of interest in all three sections of the hippocampus, CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus.<br><br>I indeed found that select genes had different expression levels in the kainite treated rats compared to the controls. For example, DNMT, a methylation gene, was decreased in area CA1 and CA3 compared to controls.<br><br>My data indicates that gene expression differed between a seizure model of epilepsy and the control rats. Knowing what genes are dysregulated in epilepsy and what their effect is on the brain will allow testing for targets of therapeutic treatment of the disorder in the future.

RNA INTERFERENCE AS AN EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY METHOD OF INSECT POPULATION CONTROL
Roshan Palli, Joseph Ferguson, 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Insect populations are currently controlled using pesticides that contaminate the environment and have deleterious effects in humans. This study was conducted in order to find an alternative to pesticides for insect population control. RNA interference (RNAi) uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to knock-down the expression of target genes. To test whether RNAi could be used to control pest populations, and to test which gene knock-down would be most effective, four genes were targeted (Actin, SRC, SIM, SEC23) in the Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB). Since these genes code for proteins that are required for insect's survival, we hypothesized that the dsRNA treatments would be lethal. Equal amounts of control (GFP control dsRNA producing Bacteria, and Deltamethrin, a common pesticide) and treatments were fed to beetles along with their diet. Weight gain and mortality were recorded every 2 days for 20 days. Results show that each treatment, and Deltamethrin, had a significant impact on the survival of the CPB. Actin and SRC were the most effective; SIM and SEC23 were also effective. Deltamethrin was less effective, illustrating the problem of pesticide resistance. We conducted the same test on Lady Bird Beetles, predators of the CPB, to determine whether our treatments were highly specific. Our treatments, along with the GFP control, had no noticeable effect on the beetles, whereas the Deltamethrin treated beetles had a very low survival rate, showing the negative effects of pesticides. Our data showed that RNAi can be used as a safer, cheaper, and more effective alternative to pesticides.

SECOND LIFE: NOVEL AND INTERSPECIES REPROGRAMMING OF INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
Won Ik Lee, Hong Joon Park, 
Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have immense potential for regenerative medicine and tissue repair. One approach to generate such cells from mammalian somatic cells involves the expression of four defined transcription factors, Klf4, c-Myc, Oct3/4, and Sox2. However, current reprogramming strategies through retroviral transduction lead to tumorigenesis, and the difficulty of maintaining human iPSC pluripotency further discourages clinical use. Thus, the purpose of this project was to develop a novel method of reprogramming that precludes tumorigenesis and facilitates iPSC colony maintenance. We hypothesized that polyethyleneimine (PEI) transfection using four murine Yamanaka factors in human fibroblasts should allow for the overcoming of both major challenges. After transfecting with DNA-PEI complexes, a number of fluorescence and enzyme immunoassays indicated optimal ratios for PEI-based reprogramming. Moreover, our results demonstrate that generation of iPSCs can be accomplished interspecially by reprogramming human fibroblasts to pluripotency with murine genes. This was confirmed by morphological and alkaline phosphatase analyses and immunohistological staining of the unique human interspecies iPSC colonies, which showed that they do not differ in form or function from traditional human iPSCs. Most importantly, it was shown that the pluripotency of human interspecies iPSCs can be preserved on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) instead of the conventional feeder layer, greatly promoting ease of maintenance. Thus, we demonstrate that PEI transfection is an efficient, viable method of iPSC generation without the risk of insertional mutagenesis and present the novel development of human interspecies iPSCs, providing a promising future for the clinical use of iPSCs.

EXPRESSION OF A SCHIZOPHRENIA-ASSOCIATED V321L-NRG1 PROTEIN REDUCES NRG1-ICD NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION AND ALPHA-7 NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION
Neil Mehta, Savina Kim, 
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder characterized by neurophysiological deficits as a result of altered neurodevelopment. Although it affects 1% of the population, it accounts for 25% of all hospital beds, 40% used for long term care. The neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) gene and alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) are major schizophrenia endophenotypes. This project aims to assess a novel schizophrenia-associated mutation of Nrg1, a valine to leucine substitution (V321L), which has functional differences from its wild-type (WT) counterpart in dendritic morphology and protein processing. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing WT or V321L Type III Nrg1 genes were generated and used to transduce primary cortical neurons from mice heterozygous for Type III Nrg1. Immunofluorescence assessed the difference of surface expression of α7nAChRs and showed an approximately 50% decrease from the WT to V321L samples (5.31 versus 2.67). HEK293 cells were transduced with either AAV-WT or AAV-V321L and immunofluorescence showed that V321L-expressing cells have decreased Nrg1 fluorescence within the nuclei. Data outcomes suggest the V321L mutation causes a significant decrease in α7nAChR localization and reduction in nuclear signaling. These V321L-Nrg1-associated phenotypic deficits are also associated with schizophrenia and are also present in Type III Nrg1 deficient cells associated with schizophrenia. The AAVs used are effective delivery vectors Nrg1, and will be used as a gene therapy mechanism on in vivo models of Nrg1-mutant mice. Overall, this study links a functional mutation with significant phenotypic abnormalities and enables researchers to determine how defects in Type III Nrg1 signaling may contribute to phenotypes present in schizophrenia.

CREATING AN EXPRESSION VECTOR CONTAINING THE APOPTIN GENE FOR GENETIC MODIFICATION OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA THROUGH AGROBACTERIUM MEDIATED GENE TRANSFER
Brennan Scott Winkler, Ellen Peterson, 
Jordan Applied Technology Center, West Jordan, UT

Purpose: The purpose of our project is to create an expression vector containing the apoptin gene to genetically modify Arabidopsis thaliana, through Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer, to express the apoptin protein for the use of cancer therapeutics. <br><br>Experimental Data: Primers were designed to match the desired fragments of the transformation vector. The primers contain overhangs to make them homologous to one another in a specific order. DNA was extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana using the Qiagen Plant DNA Extraction Kit to use as a template for polymerase chain reaction; direct polymerase chain reaction was also conducted with different bacterial species. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to obtain the desired fragments using specific polymerases, buffers, and PCR run cycles. All fragments will be put into a one step isothermal reaction to assemble the vector.<br><br>Conclusion: Based on the results the pCB301 vector, upstream homologous, nos terminators, gentamicin resistance gene, and the downstream homologous have been amplified by polymerase chain reaction. It is unsure whether the SUC2 promoter has been amplified yet, but more polymerase chain reaction will be performed. After all the fragments have been obtained they will be used in a one step isothermal reaction to create the expression vector(2). After the vector is formed we will transform it into a non-tumor inducing strain of Agrobacterium. Arabidopsis thaliana will then be transformed with the vector through Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer to express apoptin(13)(1). These transgenic plants could potentially be prepared for human consumption or for medicine and vaccines to be used as a novel cancer treatment(10)(16).

THE EFFECTS OF GOLD AND PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES' ON DENTAL PULP STEM CELL GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION
Abraham Delanor Killanin, Evan Schneider, 
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY

Adult stem cells, repairing agents that replenish dead or injured cells, differentiate to form specific tissue. This project investigated effects that nanoparticles, increasingly prevalent in medical and consumer items, exert on stem cell growth and differentiation. Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) were incubated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs). Since diabetic glucose levels increase cell membrane porosity, DPSCs were incubated in diabetic and normal physiological glucose levels with PtNPs to see if they differ in uptake. Growth curves demonstrate that both PtNPs inhibit cell growth more than AuNPs, with folate-rich (FR)-PtNPs more toxic than folate-poor (FP)-PtNPs. TEM images indicate that uptake of FR-PtNPs is higher in vacuoles than FP-PtNPs, suggesting that folic acid receptors may facilitate penetration. When grown in varying glucose concentrations, cells treated with FR-PtNPs showed little difference in nanoparticle uptake.<br><br>DPSCs grew with 13nm AuNPs and 45nm AuNPs, but cell doubling time increased. TEM images show that nanoparticle types occupy cell vacuoles differently. AuNPs did not penetrate the nuclear membrane but PtNPs did, explaining why toxicity of PtNPs was significantly higher than gold. In addition, PtNPS induced differentiation, producing osteocalcin, whereas AuNPs did not. Cells in AuNPs produced osteocalcin in dexamethasone (differentiation-inducing media) whereas no osteocalcin was present in non-inducing media. Cells cultured with 45nm AuNPs displayed healthy parallel actin fiber alignment similar to control cells, but actin fibers in cells FR-PtNPs showed disorganized fibers. Future work includes incorporating PtNPs into a polymer matrix to induce stem cell differentiation for tissue engineering.

HOW IS PLANT PHOTOSYNTHESIS AFFECTED BY HIGH LIGHT STRESS?
Daniel Lars Nordqvist, Sanne Johansson, 
Berzeliusskolan, Linkoping, Ostergotland, SWEDEN

The main purpose of this study was to investigate how the photosynthetic process is affected by high intense light stress. The effects of environmental changes like this is of great interest as our growing population demands even greater returns from farming. With knowledge of how plants and their photosynthesis is affected, one can ensure optimal production.<br><br> To investigate the impact on photosynthesis the oxygen evolution, a byproduct of the process, of Arabidopsis thaliana was measured as it was stressed with high intense light. The amount of D1 protein, a vital enzyme in photosystem II, was also studied over time. To enable us to draw useful conclusions, three ecotypes with different geographical distributions were analyzed.<br><br> Our research showed that the oxygen evolution decreases over time as the D1 protein is degraded. This indicates the importance of the D1 protein in photosystem II. We have also noticed that the three ecotypes have been affected differently by the high intense light stress. The differences can be linked to their geographical distribution were the most tolerant ecotype derives from an area closest to the equator.<br><br> Evolution has adapted the different ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana to their natural environment. This means for example that natural selection at the equator has favored the species that have relatively high tolerance for high intense light. This, we believe, is why the ecotypes showed different resistance. If a farmer near the equator would grow Arabidopsis thaliana or another plant that responds in a similar way to high intense light stress, our research suggests that one always must take into account the origin of the ecotype in question for optimal production.

CHARACTERIZATION OF ENOLASE, A GLYCOLYTIC ENZYME IN PLASMODIUM YOELII
Kacie Catharine Farrell, Tara Knox, Savannah Lee
Mount Saint Joseph Academy, Flourtown, PA

Worldwide, there are 350 to 500 million cases of malaria each year. In the search for a safe and effective vaccine, leading candidate antigens are proteins present on the surface of merozoites, the stage of the malarial parasite that invades red blood cells and causes clinical malaria. Our objective was to determine whether other parasite proteins, such as cytosolic proteins, might present additional vaccine candidates. Studies show that the Plasmodium yoelii 17X, a non-lethal strain of malaria in rodents, models the human infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Blood-stage malaria parasites derive energy (ATP) needed for growth almost exclusively from glycolysis. Enolase is typically considered a soluble glycolytic enzyme, present in the cytoplasm. Enolase of malaria parasites has been reported to exist in several isoforms and these modifications may alter subcellular localization and function. In this project, we characterized enolase in P. yoelii blood-stage parasites and evaluated its potential as a component of a blood-stage malaria vaccine. Using a plasmid construct containing the gene for PyEnolase, we assessed the expression of recombinant PyEnolase in E. coli. Rabbit antibodies raised against enolase detected the size of native protein in Py17X antigen. Immunofluorescence assays showed that Py enolase is localized in the cytoplasm of the parasite and not associated with membrane. Data from ELISA also showed that animals immunized with recombinant PyEnolase induced a good antibody response against the protein and that this response was boosted enormously from primary to secondary immunization.

THE EFFECTS OF DISRUPTING RNA POLYMERASE III SUBUNIT RPC82 FAMILY PROTEIN ON POLLEN TUBE GROWTH IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Sumedha Ravishankar, Sirtaj Bir Singh, 
Empire High School, Tucson, AZ

This experiment was designed to test the role of RNA polymerase III subunit RPC82 family protein (encoded by FEM 137 gene) in pollen tube growth and it was hypothesized that this gene was important for pollen tube growth. Two types of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana were used in the experiment; wild type (control) and a mutant defective in the FEM 137 gene. Pollen tetrads from wild type and fem137 heterozygous plants were placed on pollen growth media. After incubating overnight, pollen from the mutant plant had grown significantly fewer tubes, and of the tubes that had grown, they were significantly shorter than the wild type pollen tubes. The majority of the wild type pollen tetrads gave rise to 3 or 4 tubes, whereas a majority of the fem137/+ mutant pollen tetrads had grown primarily 1 or 2 tubes. This indicates that the FEM 137 gene has a role in pollen tube growth because it decreased pollen tube germination, as well as affected tube growth. Pollen tube is critical for fertilization and consequently seed formation in plants; therefore, understanding the genes that control pollen tube growth in model plant may aid in increasing yield of crop plants.

TOWARDS THE CURE: ABNORMAL PROTEIN INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMYLOID BETA AND TAU AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Raghav Tripathi
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Background:<br><br>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related mental disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. However, current therapeutics for the disease are unreliable. Two major pathologically abnormal proteins are observable in AD brains: extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (HP-tau) in the learning and memory regions.<br><br>Objectives and Methods: <br><br>This study tested the hypothesis that Abeta and tau synergistically interact to create aggregated Abeta-tau complexes that exacerbate AD neuronal death. After ascertaining that such interactions occur, the correlation between Abeta-tau complexes and the progression of AD severity was researched via Molecular Dynamics Simulations, and five novel Abeta-tau interaction inhibiting molecules were designed and proposed as therapeutics. Immunostaining, immunoblotting, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were used to determine the presence/level of Abeta-tau complexes in donated brain tissue.<br><br>Results/Conclusion:<br><br>This study is the first to uncover and design therapeutics for a novel mechanism underlying AD. It was determined that Abeta-tau complexes form in the AD brain and intensify AD. Immunoblot results showed that Abeta and HP-tau are up-regulated in AD. Immunostaining showed tight Abeta-tau co-localization. Co-IP/immunoblotting revealed high levels of HP-tau in AD brain elutes precipitated for Abeta, indicating that the existence of Abeta-tau complexes increases as AD progresses. Taken together, these findings suggest that Abeta and tau interact to create complexes that increase toxicity selectively in AD-afflicted neurons. The drugs developed by this research may be therapeutic strategies for hindering AD progression.

EXPRESSION OF A FUSION PROTEIN: CSOS1A-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN
Nickolas Tremain Whitehead
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS

Carboxysomes are protein organelles that are found in cyanobacteria and many chemoautotrophic bacteria. Most of the carbon dioxide fixation in a cell takes place within the carboxysome, which acts as a carbon concentrating device. The small pores located at the center of the protein hexamers and pentamers that make up the carboxysome shell are thought to allow bicarbonate to diffuse into the carboxysome interior, where a carbonic anhydrase converts the bicarbonate to carbon dioxide. Because carbon dioxide cannot diffuse easily through the carboxysome shell, it is trapped inside and is fixed by ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) onto ribulose-1,5-biphosphate to yield two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. The goal of this project is to express a fusion of the carboxysome shell protein CsoS1A and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) that can be used to locate the CsoS1A on the carboxysome shell.

HEPG2 (HUMAN HEPATOCELLULAR LIVER CARCINOMA CELL LINE): INFLAMMATION RESPONSE
Jennifer Manyu Wong
Kapolei High School, Kapolei, HI

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease that affects 2 to 5 percent of Americans, and its prevalence is rising. NASH is the condition of when the liver is steatotic, inflamed, and damaged. Obesity and diabetes may play a role in the development of NASH. HepG2 is an isolated cell line of a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether palmitic acid and increasing amounts of insulin cause inflammation in the HepG2 cells, progressing to NASH. The Oil Red O staining assay stains lipids in the cells, an indication for steatosis. Results showed that significant fat accumulation was presented by Oil Red O staining in cells exposed to 5% BSA, 0.5 mM palmitic acid and 0.5 uM insulin. The Human IL-8 ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) was performed to analyze the protein levels, particularly Protein IL-8 secreted by cells when inflamed. The data showed palmitic acid and increased amount of insulin led to production of large amounts of IL-8. HepG2 cells treated with 5 % BSA only (control variable), had an average concentration of 35.810pg/ml while liver cells treated with 5% BSA, 0.5mM of palmitic acid, and 0.5 µM of insulin had an average concentration of 195.48 pg/ml, which increased a significant amount. The present study suggests that fatty liver cells with high levels of insulin are more inflamed, predisposing them to NASH. Future studies need to be conducted for evidence of damage in the liver cells.

THE IMPACT OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES ON CHROMOSOME STABILITY: FRAGILE SITE DISRUPTION IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AS A MODEL
Deeksha Deep
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

Hairpin formation due to inverted repeats on the lagging strand of a replication fork can cause the polymerase to pause and lead to chromosome loss or breakage at fragile sites. To study the behavior of the fragile site in a case where the hairpin is disrupted, the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used. On chromosome III, the fragile site 2 region displays hairpin formation under low levels of polymerase α. To study this site’s behavior when hairpin formation is inhibited, three previously created strains (FJL014, FJL016, FJL018) of S. cerevisiae prevented hairpin formation through the insertion of the hygromycin-resistance gene either on the centromere-proximal or centromere-distal Ty1 element or as a spacer between the Ty1 elements. The strains were grown in low-galactose agar to decrease polymerase activity and then illegitimately mated with the tester strain 1225. The diploids were selected, purified, and then analyzed for the presence of the His4 and Thr4 genes. The presence of both meant that no chromosome loss or breakage occurred. In FJL014, 94% of the diploids did not show any breakage. In FJL016 and FJL018, 92% of the diploids’ chromosomes remained intact. This indicates that disrupting the hairpin reduces the fragility of the site.

MATRIX SPECIFIC ENDOTHELIAL CELL RESPONSES TO ADVANCED GLYCATED END PRODUCTS
Ruth Anne Bishop
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Recent findings show the potential role the subendothelial extracellular matrix plays in the early progression of atherosclerosis. These studies found that the transitional matrix protein fibronectin enhances the endothelium's proinflammatory response to proatherogenic stimuli in vitro. None of these studies, however, examined fibronectin's role in the early development of atherosclerosis in a hyperglycemia/Type I diabetes model. For this study it was hypothesized that endothelial cells plated on fibronectin versus a healthy matrix would have a more pronounced proinflammatory response to the proinflammatory stimulus, advanced glycated end products (AGEs). In this hyperglycemia-induced atherosclerosis model, it was determined through Western blotting and qRT-PCR that fibronectin does indeed enhance the endothelium's proinflammatory responses through increased proinflammatory protein expression and mRNA transcription. AGEs, however, did not cause a statistically significant increase in proinflammatory protein expression but did cause a significant increase in proinflammatory mRNA transcription. Thus, AGEs alone may not play as significant a role in hyperglycemia-induced atherosclerosis as previously predicted.

A POTENTIAL ANTICANCER COMPOUND AGAINST CANCER STEM CELLS
Anke Wang
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

Cancerous tumors contain small percentages (~0.1%) of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), which are more difficult to destroy compared to normal cancer cells, and cause relapses of cancer after various clinical therapies. The escaped CSCs can form new cancerous tumors resistant to prior treatments. Thus, it is critical to develop new drugs to target CSCs. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, critical for cell proliferation, was shown to be highly active in CSCs but not in normal cells. If interaction between the β-catenin and T-cell factor (tcf) could be inhibited by a small molecule, CSCs would go through apoptosis. The newly discovered compound “C7” interfered with interactions of β-catenin and tcf based on crystal structural analysis. In this project, CSC-like cells (HCT116 cells) were used to study C7 effect on CSC apoptosis/necrosis (cell death). CSCs were treated with either various concentrations of C7 ranging from 0.1 µm to 20 µm or only DMSO (control). After 1-3 days of treatment, large amounts of cells were observed to die in the treated cells but not in control by microscope. Cell viability (activity or cell apoptosis) by Cell Titer-Blue method with Synergy2 machine showed that all groups treated with C7 for three days had significantly lower cell activity than the control group, suggesting cell apoptosis and/or necrosis occurred in C7 treated groups. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation of cell genome examined by agarose gel electrophoresis indicated significant deterioration and fragmentation in the DNA from C7 treated cells, but not from the control cells, which suggests apoptosis occurred in the treated cells but not in the control cells. Thus, C7 is an anticancer compound with the potential to become a new-generation drug which targets cancer stem cells.

KOMBUCHA TEA: THE EFFECTS OF A CURE-ALL TEA ON TRANSCRIPTIONAL SLIPPAGE
Dahyana Arias
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

This project focuses on the effects of Kombucha Tea on transcriptional slippage. Transcriptional slippage is an error that occurs in mRNA transcription when RNA Polymerase "slips" along a run of adenine or thymine. It has been connected to certain types of Alzheimers and Down's Syndrome. This project uses the bacteria strains AP3145 and AP3133 grown in 10% Kombucha tea to test the effects of the tea on transcriptional slippage. It was predicted that Kombucha tea would induce transcriptional slippage in both strains of bacteria. The bacteria were grown in the sample media and a control growth media and shifed to a warmer environment to promote the transcription of the lacZ gene in bacteria. This gene has been disabled in these bacteria, but transcriptional slippage would activate it again. If the lacZ gene aws activated, the bacteria would produce B-galactosidase. The samples were measured for production of B-galactosidase using an ONPG assay. It was found that Kombucha tea prevented transcriptional slippage in both strains of bacteria, disproving hypothesis of this experiment. In the first trial, Kombucha lowered the occurrence of transcriptional slippage by about 15% in AP3145 and 26% in AP3133. In the third trial, it lowered the occurrence by 14% in AP3145 and 11% in AP3133. At this time, more trials of the experiment must be performed before a concrete conclusion can be made.

LEUKEMIA PATIENT DNA ANALYSIS AFTER BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT
Courtney Marie Kloske
Pope John Paul II Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL

Leukemia is a cancer of the blood that arises when multiple control systems in maturing blood cells malfunction. Stem cells in the bone marrow produce only immature blood cells. There are many approaches to treating Leukemia, including chemotherapy, stem cell transplants, gene specific therapy, and bone marrow transplants. This experiment studies saliva and hair DNA from a bone marrow transplant patient. A female who had leukemia received a bone marrow transplant. In her case, the bone marrow was from a male donor. In this experiment, I was trying to determine whether her saliva or hair had male DNA or not. The results on the hair were inconclusive, but the results from the experiment showed that her saliva did have male DNA. This means that when making forensic or medical diagnoses or a research conclusion based on saliva, it is important to consider whether the person has had a bone marrow transplant before drawing any conclusions.

ADIPOSE BECOME NEURONS WITH A HELPING HAND FROM NANOG
Jacob Kimmel
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Human neural stem cells (hNSCs) have shown potential in treating a variety of neurological diseases. However, they are impractical to isolate from a live patient and use for an autologous transplant, generating demand for an alternative source of hNSCs. ADSCs may be a potential alternative source, as they are easily isolated from a patient’s adipose tissue in great quantity, and may have the potential to efficiently transdifferentiate into hNSCs after pluripotency is induced through transfection of the Nanog gene.<br><br><br>ADSCs were transfected with pMaxGFP plasmid and pcDNA4HisMaxx/TOPO plasmid containing Nanog. Five days post-transfection, RNA was isolated from transfected ADSCs. cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNA by reverse transcription, and the cDNA product was used to quantify expression of Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 against reference β-actin by quantitative PCR. ADSCs were cocultured with differentiated hNSCs for 15 days using 12-well coculture inserts with 0.4 μm pores, allowing for the exchange of cell signaling factors while preventing direct cell contact. ADSCs stained with β-tubulin primary antibodies tagged with a TRITC conjugate. GFAP expression levels were assessed by qPCR of cDNA synthesized from coculture RNA. <br><br> <br><br>Nanog transfection significantly increased levels of pluripotency markers Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, indicating an increase in the pluripotent potential of Nanog transfected ADSCs. Post-coculture, Nanog transfected ADSCs had significantly increased glial differentiation, evidenced by GFAP expression levels and morphological changes. However, β-tubulin expression data conflicts with morphological changes in Nanog transfected cultures; further data collection is necessary before conclusions can be drawn on differentiation into neurons.

MIRNA 205: SUPPRESSING INPP4B AND WNT5A EXPRESSION
Lawrence Zhang
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

MicroRNA (miRNA) 205 plays an important role in skin cancer by suppressing certain target genes. miRNA suppresses its target by binding to unique nucleotide sequences (seeds) in the 3’UTRs of the target’s mRNA. Because Inpp4b and Wnt5a, both regulators of cell growth, have prominent miRNA 205 seeds, the miRNA may suppress their expression.<br><br>miRNA 205 seeds on the 3’UTRs of Inpp4b and Wnt5a were mutated using PCR to prevent the miRNA from binding. A Luciferase assay was performed to provide quantitative data of protein activity and miRNA 205 binding efficiency because there is no direct way to measure Inpp4b and Wnt5a activity. First, the mutated and wild–type 3’UTRs were ligated into Luciferase plasmids. A total of six different types of plasmids were created (mutated and wild–type Inpp4b, mutated and wild–type Wnt5a, and positive and negative controls). These plasmids were amplified through E. coli transformation, and later transfected into Mouse Epidermal Keratinocytes.<br><br>The results of the Luciferase assay show that the Luciferase activity of the plasmids with mutated 3’UTRs are significantly higher than the wild–type ones. Thus, miRNA 205 did bind to its seeds in the wild–type 3’UTRs to restrict protein synthesis.<br><br>In conclusion, miRNA 205 does suppress the expression of both Inpp4b and Wnt5a.Because miRNA 205 suppresses both Inpp4b and Wnt5a, it directly causes fluctuations in their expression levels, which in turn can cause cancer. Thus, miRNA 205 can be potentially used as an early marker to detect Inpp4b and Wnt5a–related cancers.

ASCL3: A NOVEL POSITIVE REGULATOR OF VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL PROLIFERATION
Vivek Kamlesh Patel
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

Cardiovascular disease and Cancer are the Leading causes of death in the world. Both these ailments are considered proliferative because of the different stimuli that arouse them. To discontinue harm caused by these diseases and disorders the cell cycle had to be altered in an early phase of the cell cycle. The CDK2 kinase (cyclin dependant kinase 2) is a vital kinase in the progression of a cell from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. ASCL3, a Basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor was known to have relation with cyclin. These facts aroused the hypothesis that ASCL3 was a substrate of the CDK2 kinase. To prove the hypothesis, a series of experiments, regarding ASCL3 and its effects on cells were performed. The results showed that as ASCL3 was expressed in greater numbers, cell proliferation was increased, and as ASCL3 numbers decreased, cell proliferation also decreased. This data indicated that ASCL3 may be a positive regulator of cell cycle. This led to the conclusion that ASCL3 was indeed a substrate of the CDK2 kinase. Other conclusions formed during the research stated that mutations of the DNA binding domains may also decelerate growth.

A PREBIOTIC THERMALLY-DRIVEN RNA REPLICATION MECHANISM
Stanley Paul Palasek
Sonoran Science Academy, Tucson, AZ

The emergence of self-replication and information transmission in life's origin remains unexplained despite extensive research on the topic. That RNA and proteins rely on one another for synthesis leads to a paradox that was only resolved with Cech's discovery of self-splicing ribozymes. Still, the origin of these ribozymes themselves remains unclear. A more complete resolution is conjectured here based on nucleotides' dynamics in hydrothermal vent systems. First a model for their oscillatory trajectories is derived and used to demonstrate thermal cycling from each particle's perspective. This is shown to result in a PCR-like replication process. The stretches of time spent at low temperatures farther from the vent permit nucleotides to surpass the activation energy needed for annealing with high probability without intervention from a complex biological catalyst.

ROLE OF MYD88 IN DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE
Yiyuan Hu

The myeloid differentiation primary response factor 88 (MyD88) is an essential adaptor protein in the signaling of the innate immune system through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The goal of this study was to further explore the role of MyD88 after collaborators reported that the expression of DNA damage repair genes was induced by TLR stimulation. MyD88’s possible role in the DNA damage response (DDR) was interrogated using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from MyD88 wild type and MyD88-deficient (knockout) mouse embryos. MyD88 knockout MEFs had less growth when compared to that of wild-type MEFs. Knockout cells had less survival seven days after ionizing and ultraviolet radiation than wild-type cells. Knockout cells also exhibited delayed reentry into mitosis following irradiation as well as heightened sensitivity to stress caused by Fetal Bovine Serum starvation. Notably, western blotting showed that the induction of ATM, a critical early DNA damage sensor, and downstream proteins such as Chk2, P53, and phosphorylated P53 is decreased in MyD88-deficient cells. These novel findings suggest that MyD88 assists in the maintenance of genomic stability by stabilizing the induction of the critical DNA damage sensor ATM. By discovering this unexpected role of MyD88, this study has uncovered a novel interaction between the innate immune and DNA damage response systems. Further elucidation of this DNA damage response mechanism could provide fresh targets and treatments for cancers and other DNA damage associated diseases.

HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 70 REGULATES INTERLEUKIN 10 PRODUCING REGULATORY T CELLS
Anuj Sanjay Marathe
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Purpose: <br><br> Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is known for its regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). Interestingly, regulatory T-cells (T-reg) that produce IL-10 have been shown to assist in protecting the colonic epithelium against inflammatory damage. This study aimed to examine the effect that Hsp70 would have on IL-10 producing T-reg cell populations. <br><br>Procedure:<br><br> Tissue samples from the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes of five wildtype (WT) and five Hsp70 knockout (KO) mice that had severe bowel inflammation, due to a 5 day treatment of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), were collected for histology tissue staining, cytokine analysis, and flow cytometry for T-reg cell detection.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br> It was found that Hsp70 KO mice were more susceptible to inflammatory damage and that they exhibited a pro-inflammatory colonic environment from elevated levels of IL-6 and decreased levels of IL-10. Flow cytometry revealed that the number of IL-10 producing T-reg cells decreased significantly. This data showed that Hsp70 most likely plays a contributory role in the regulation of IL-10 producing T-reg cells. These findings may indicate a new treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease that involves the up-regulation of Hsp70 to reestablish homeostatic conditions.

HOW DOES THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVED REGION ADJACENT TO THE RALDH2 GENE AFFECT THE PATTERNED ACCUMULATION OF RETINOIC ACID IN A DEVELOPING ZEBRAFISH EMBRYO?
Ariella Galya Hoffman-Peterson
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

This investigation focuses on the functioning of the RALDH2 gene promoter, which plays a vital role in embryonic development and is directly involved in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The goal is to investigate whether or not the evolutionarily conserved region adjacent to the RALDH2 gene plays an active role in the patterned accumulation of Retinoic Acid directed by the gene.<br><br>LR RXN RALDH2 B4 bacterial strain was cultured to amplify the DNA. The ideal restriction enzyme was chosen to remove ECR. DNA was ligated and plasmids, along with synthetically made TOL2 Transposase mRNA, was injected into single-celled wildtype zebrafish embryos. Later the patterns of the T2 generation were studied, either left untreated to show altered expression patterns or treated with ethanol to simulate the effects of FAS.<br><br>New DNA construct, without the ECR, was successfully completed. Studying T2 generation embryos confirm that the expression is absent in myomeres, but present in the notochord, whereas normal embryos pattern heavily in the myomeres. Some head and neck expression is present in RALDH2-SnaB1:YFP that is not in controls. This suggests that the ECR may have a role in directing the expression in the myomeres as well as potentially the head and neck regions. The hypothesis that the ECR plays a role in RALDH2 expression is supported by the consistent pattern seen in the embryos. Ethanol exposure did not greatly alter patterns as compared to untreated RALDH2-SnaB1:YFP patterning, refuting the hypothesis that expression would look different in the two groups.

THE MISSING GENOME: MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS IN STEM CELLS
Joshua Abraham Meier
Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology, Hackensack, NJ

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have great potential for regenerative medicine, including the ability to avoid rejection in transplantation scenarios, as well as relative ease of procurement compared to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), although in comparison, they have a much higher rate of apoptosis, a decreased rate of proliferation, and premature aging behavior. While the reasons for these phenomena have yet to be elucidated, it was hypothesized in this study that they are triggered by the large-scale “common deletion” in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of iPSCs. The presence of this deletion was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the mtDNA of iPSCs, which showed that the iPSCs studied did contain this specific deletion. An assay based on real-time (RT-) PCR was used to quantify the level of mtDNA deletions within each cell type, revealing that while heteroplasmic, up to 60% of iPSC mtDNA molecules may be subject to the “common deletion”. Transmission electron microscopy was utilized in order to determine morphologic differences between the mitochondria of iPSCs and their source cells, revealing definite disparities in terms of size and structural properties. These data demonstrate that iPSCs (compared to ESCs) have mtDNA deletions and morphologic changes that may be the basis for their premature senescence, and that the mtDNA deletions are a function of iPSC generation methodology. By comparing mtDNA deletion levels and morphologic differences, a diagnostic test can be developed for determining whether novel methods of generating iPSCs maintain their inherent clinical potential without producing rapid senescence.

EFFECT OF OVER-EXPRESSION OF SSRP1 ON TUMOR CELL GROWTH AND SURVIVAL, AND REGULATION OF SUPPRESSOR OF TY16 LEVELS
Seamus Emmett Degan
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

Effects of curaxins on p53 and NF-kB, as well as their toxicity to cancer cells, result from “chromatin trapping” of the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex. This FACT inaccessibility leads to phosphorylation: adding of a phosphate to a protein of the p53 Ser392 by Casein Kinase 2 and inhibition of NF-kB–dependent transcription, which requires FACT activity at the elongation stage. This idea is the basis of studying the addition of more FACT, in the form of over-expression of SSRP1 and studying its effect on tumor cell growth and survival. Using pLV-CMV-Neomycin-SSRP1 as a method of over-expression, clear tumor cell growth and survival was seen in HT1080's and clear decrease in MDA-MB-231's and Mcf7's. This is grounds for further research in this field of study

STEM CELL CHARACTERIZATION OF CANCEROUS AND NON-CANCEROUS MUS MUSCULUS LIVER CELLS AT 50% AND 100% CONFLUENCY
Cynthia Li
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cancer cells that display properties similar to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and thus are able to give rise to more cancer cells. CSCs are thought to be a cause of cancer relapse and drugs that target these CSCs would therefore have a higher rate of success in complete remission. However, these cells are hard to isolate and target as the known cell surface protein markers are not exclusive to CSCs and the proportion of CSCs differs amongst different types and stages of cancer. Thus further characterization of CSCs is necessary to finding effective markers. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of expression of Oct-4, NANOG, AFP, Flk-1, NCAM, and GAPDH and beta-Actin in non-cancerous mouse liver cells (AML 12) and cancerous mouse liver cells (Hepa 1-6) at 50% and 100% confluency in order find whether cancerous cells at 50% and 100% confluency would have different levels of stem-cell-marker expression compared to non-cancerous cells at 50% and 100% confluency through RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and finally, qPCR. The qPCR results indicated that there is indeed a difference between the expression levels of the stem cell markers, specifically AFP (40.4 average % change) and NCAM (37.6 average % change), between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Potential applications of this information include the use of one or more stem-cell markers to isolate and/or target CSCs for effective cancer treatment and the use of stem-cell markers as biomarkers for cancer type and severity.

GENERATION OF INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS WITH ONLY OCT4 AND A CHEMICAL COCKTAIL
Mina Guo
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Direct reprogramming of somatic cells provides an opportunity for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and new drug discovery. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are usually generated from mouse fibroblasts by transduction of four transcription factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, but the use of iPSCs is hindered by the viral delivery system. The reprogramming efficiency generally is very low, and the introduction of viral genetic materials leads to potential genome mutation. I report a chemical approach to generate monkey iPSCs with a unique small molecule combination: Valproic acid (VPA), E-616452, and CHIR99021. After four weeks of chemical treatment, two monkey iPSCs out of 5×〖10〗^4 cells were obtained. They exhibited pluripotency and an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like global gene expression profile, with silenced expression of exogenous genes. The chemical-induced iPSC reprogramming has efficiency close to OSK viral group. The use of three molecules advances in revealing that inhibition of TGF-β signaling, inhibition of histone deacetylation, and activation of Wnt signaling are sufficient for iPS cell reprogramming by Oct4 alone. This research demonstrates successful chemical-induced reprogramming by overexpressing Oct4 alone, which does not endogenously express the other three factors essential for reprogramming. Thus, this method provides a basis for developing safer and nonviral methods for reprogramming.

MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF THE MORPHINE SIGNALING SYSTEM: A NOVEL TREATMENT FOR DIABETES
Cheng Charles Yu
The Wheatley School, Old westbury, NY

This is a continuation project of previous work of glucose's effects on the morphine signaling system. Previous research found a whole new system in which glucose works through that may be harmful for diabetic patients: the morphine signaling system. The novel study centers on the effects of high levels of glucose on the nitric oxide synthase system, which is coupled to the morphine signaling system and on the gene expression of nitric oxide response controllers. Through gene expression analysis, this study proved that glucose up regulates the NOS1 gene, the nitric oxide controller gene, which increases nitric oxide levels within the bloodstream. While at the same time, glucose down-regulates the MPO gene, which is responsible for the anti-oxidant response to nitric oxide, which means glucose decreases this necessary response. in addition, the study dove into greater depths in cellular imaging analysis of Endothelial cells, a new variable which more relevant to the study of diabetes.; This new variable in this study further proves/emphasizes that glucose works through this system to severely damage vascular cells and that two substances, Naloxone, the mu-opioid receptor antagonists, and L-NAME, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor mitigate the damaging effects of elevated levels of glucose on the morphine signaling system. Over-elevated levels of glucose lead to extreme nitric oxide levels and cause severe vascular cellular damage via oxidative DNA damage within diabetic patients, which has been evidenced previously. This novel study shows that L-NAME and Naloxone are phenomenal treatments for diabetics against these effects.

HUMAN MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HEART AND PANCREATIC DISEASE CAUSE ADIPOGENESIS DEFECTS IN MICE AND IN A CELL CULTURE MODEL
Edgar Ferrer-Lorenzo
East Chapel Hill High School, Chapel Hill, NC

Mutation or deficiency in the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin-B causes cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with abnormal levels of glucose, and increased risk for sudden cardiac death and type-2 diabetes. Surprisingly, ankyrin-B mutations are commonly found in 2% of Europeans and 8% of individuals from West Africa. However, their functional relevance and how they cause disease remains unclear. We are trying to answer these questions and evaluate the effects of the ankyrin-B mutations by using mice that carry either the L1622I variant, which is the most common of the ankyrin-B mutations, or the R1788W mutation that causes severe problems in the heart and pancreas and it is found in patients with type-2 diabetes. Preliminary characterization of these animals indicate that in addition to developing cardiac and metabolic phenotypes, ankyrin-B mutant mice gained more weight and accumulated more abdominal fat than controls mice. <br><br> This result prompted us to examine a potential role for ankyrin-B in the formation and accumulation of fat cells. For this purpose we used fat tissue obtained from mutant and control animals. We also used fibroblast cells derived from the same animals to study fat biology because they can be differentiated into fat cells. We found that mutant mice expressed reduced levels of ankyrin-B in fat cells and developed bigger adipocytes than controls. Similarly, mutant fibroblasts cells can be turned into fat cells faster, more efficiently, and their fat cells are bigger. This work suggests a role for ankyrin-B in regulating fat metabolism and a possible association between ankyrin-B and obesity, and the risk of suffering from heart and metabolic problems.

ANALYSIS OF THERMAL POOL BACTERIAL MAT COMMUNITIES
Ethan Knight Brown
Success Academy, Cedar City, UT

Microorganisms from Thermo Hot Springs have been classified as thermophilic (60 - 80 degrees Celsius) neutrophiles (pH 5 - 7) and are identified in hot springs throughout the world. These microorganisms form complex structured microbial mat communities and survive in extreme environments. Differing physical characteristics of the pools suggest that the composition of the microbial mat communities also varies. Preliminary studies on a south lying ridge identified iron and arsenic culture bacteria from one thermal pool located in Beaver County, UT. My study expands this investigation and seeks to characterize microbial species among five pools occurring on a ridge that lies north of that sampled in the earlier study. After isolating total genomic DNA from the environmental samples, the 16s rRNA gene was amplified using PCR. Subsequent cloning isolated product from individual bacteria species, but sequence reactions did not yield quality data. Further optimization of protocols is expected to provide high quality sequence data, permitting the characterization of these unique mat communities. Future studies will explore the effects of specific bacteria on the ecology within and surrounding the pools. This will allow me to investigate composition among pools and correlate diversity of mat cultures with the physical characteristics of each pool.

ELUCIDATING PATHWAYS IN CANCER PATHOGENESIS
Nithin Reddy Tumma
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

Transforming Growth Factor B (TGF-B) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that plays a critical role in cancer. In the present study, Ras (a potent oncogene) and downstream PI3-Kinase and Akt signaling (involved in survival) is examined in the context of TGF-B signaling in a progressive model of breast cancer. Via mechanistic studies, employing inhibitors of each protein in the pathway, it is shown that significant cross-talk between the TGF-B/Smad and the oncogenic Ras/PI3-K/Akt pathways exists, with active Ras and Akt facilitating the phosphorylation of the Smad proteins. From these results a novel autoregulatory feedback loop controlling cellular proliferation is proposed, modulated by the antagonistic interactions between the growth promoting Ras pathway and the growth arresting Smad proteins. <br><br> The mechanism of TGF-B mediated induction of Ras expression appeared to be due to TGF-B's role in increasing the expression of the multi-ligand binding receptor gC1qR. Interestingly, targeted inhibition of amino acid residues 76-93 of gC1qR decreased proliferation of MCF10A and U937 cells. Both cell lines were shown to secrete gC1qR, proportional to the malignancy of the cell line. Culturing cells in the presence of gC1qR increased proliferation and induced Bradykinin Receptor B2 expression. Additionally, secreted gC1qR appeared to play a role in evasion of complement-mediated lysis by the cancer cell lines. <br><br> miRNA’s are small, non-coding RNA’s integral to transcriptional regulation. The PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway was shown to be integral in the regulation of the expression several breast cancer relevant miRNAs. Further, algorithms were developed to assess the ability of combinations of miRNA’s to effectively target whole pathways, especially those implicated in cancer progression.

INFLAMMATORY IMPACT OF P38 INHIBITION IN HUMAN MONOCYTES INFECTED WITH BORRELIA BURGDORFERI, THE CAUSATIVE AGENT OF LYME DISEASE
Kathleen Rose Bashant
Burnt Hills - Ballston Lake High School, Burnt Hills, NY

The bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne illness in North America. Symptoms associated with the disease result from inflammation exacerbated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. This category of cytokine is released by monocyte-macrophages in response to lipoproteins anchored on the spirochete’s outer membrane. Monocyte-macrophages also release anti-inflammatory cytokines, which lower the inflammatory response. The PI3K/AKT/p38-MAPK plays a negative regulatory role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by mouse macrophages. Prior observations of similarities in the level and nature of inflammation between joints of mice and humans infected with Lyme disease suggested parallels between the two models, resulting in the hypothesis that p38 performs a similar function in regulating cytokine production in B. burgdorferi-infected human macrophages. Cytokine levels were measured when B. burgdorferi-stimulated U937 and THP-1 human monocyte-macrophages were dosed with p38 inhibitor or inhibitor vehicle DMSO. THP-1 cells released increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine hTNF (P < 0.001) and decreasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P < 0.001) in response to p38 inhibition, suggesting a role for the protein mirroring that observed in mouse macrophages. This study supports the mouse system is an appropriate model for Lyme pathogenesis in humans and examines differences between the U937 and THP-1 immortalized cell-lines. Ultimately, the ability of p38-MAPK activity to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production and augment anti-inflammatory cytokine production may prove invaluable to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies to alleviate symptoms associated with Lyme disease.

THE EFFECTS OF CHITOSAN ON THE REGENERATION ON PLANARIAN FLATWORMS
Logan Andrew Tye
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

Regenerative biology is a growing field of science that has recently began making use of the biomaterial called chitosan. Chitosan is a derivative of chitin that is formed by removing the acetyl groups from chitin’s glucose rings. Chitosan has been found to have antibacterial and blood clotting properties, which has made it a preferred substitute to traditional gauze bandages. Such bandages have also been shown do decrease scarring. Planarian flatworms are simple invertebrates that use both morphallactic and epimorphic regeneration. This makes them useful in determining the effects of possible regenerative agents. Since decreased scarring is a sign of increased regeneration, this experiment is designed to determine whether this increased regeneration is due to the antibacterial and blood clotting properties of chitosan, or if chitosan is directly influencing regenerating pathways. Planarians don’t have a cardiovascular system, and thus they don’t have blood, which eliminates the possibility of blood clotting increasing regeneration. Planarians are also able to regenerate in their natural habitat, which is less than sanitary, indicating their regenerative pathways aren’t significantly affected by the mild contamination in a lab experiment. By cutting and observing the growth rate of planarians in different concentrations of chitosan, it is possible to determine if the regenerative pathways of planarians are affected by chitosan. After collecting data over eight days and using an ANOVA test, it was determined that chitosan doesn’t have a significant effect on planarian regeneration. It is possible, however, that the equipment used wasn’t precise enough to detect a significant change.

SWEET POISON: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Samantha Elizabeth Grace Curran
Southmoore High School, Moore, OK

Artificial sugars have caused tremendous uproar regarding the long-term health of its consumers. This project is a continuation of Sweet Poison: Artificial Sugars’ Mutagenic Effect in the UNC 22 Gene of the Caenorhabditis elegan Locomotive Phenotype. The previous project focused on a particular mutation produced through various artificial sugars. This year, the project focuses on Aspartame, which previously produced the highest mutagenic results. By using Aspartame, this project assays a series of six different spectrums of biological and neurological behavior including: lifespan amount, locomotive rate (which correlates to nervous system development, neurotransmission, proteins pertaining to Acetylcholine), the defecation process, which provides light on a specific neurotransmitter GABA, a growth assay conducted on a computerized measuring system, biological analysis of neurological synapses, and reproductive rates. The assays pertaining to locomotion, defecation, synapse analysis, and longevity of lifespan all produce results very similar to the control worms (worms unexposed). However, through the computerized growth assay, the exposed worms had a mean body size higher than the unexposed, which concludes that Aspartame may affect the pharyngeal pumping rate in C. elegans.

EFFECT OF BIOLOGICAL COMPOUNDS ON GLYCERINATED MUSCLE CONTRACTILITY

The purpose of this experiment is to (A) identify different biological compounds as having stimulatory or inhibitory effects on muscle contractility, and (B) prove the tyramine, liver, and rabbit testicle solutions as having a stimulatory effect and the lactic acid an inhibitory effect.<br><br> Glycerinated muscle fibers were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and their initial lengths measured. Solutions of four biological compounds (tyramine, liver extract, rabbit testicle extract, and lactic acid) were added individually to the muscle fibers, and wicked dry after 5 minutes. Muscle fibers were rinsed with PBS again, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was added to each of the fibers to provide the energy for contraction. The final lengths of muscle fibers were measured after 2 minutes. The amount of muscle contraction was quantified by a slightly altered percent-of-change equation. The results supported the hypothesis that liver extract contained compounds that stimulated the highest amount of contraction – a 75.7 percent decrease from the original fiber length – followed by the rabbit testicle extract, tyramine, and lactic acid solutions.<br><br> As part of a post-experiment analysis, processes that fueled the experiment, including aerobic respiration and muscle contraction at a molecular depth, were heavily researched. The accumulated data suggests that there may be properties of the stimulatory compounds – tyramine, rabbit testicle, or liver – that could be used in possible remedies for the degeneration of muscle contraction that is often associated with old age, which can be studied and evaluated in future studies.

THE EFFECTS OF SPECTRAL VARIATION ON THE GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION OF SYNECHOCYSTIS SP. PCC 6803
Daniel Joseph McCormack
Dartmouth High School, Dartmouth, MA

Over millennia, organisms have developed mechanisms to react to the variability of electromagnetic radiation in the environment. Synechocystis, a cyanobacteria, relies primarily on blue and red light sensing. These sensors are utilized by the organism in a process known as phototaxis, positioning themselves for the optimal utilization or protection from electromagnetic radiation. These organisms also use complementary chromatic adaptation to regulate the synthesizing of proteins by utilizing binding sites on RNA sequences which code for proteins. These binding sites provide the parameters under which certain chromophores or pigments which capture light energy are synthesized. These pigments capture mainly red, green, blue, and small levels of yellow light.<br><br> A spectrophotometer was used to quantitatively measure the optical density of the samples (.5ml sample: 5ml deionized water). The data was compiled over 6 weeks while samples underwent exposure to various electromagnetic spectrums each day (10 hours) using a timer. It was observed that the higher absorption factors occurred in the samples exposed to blue and green light spectra.Thus it could be concluded that blue and green spectra of light contributed to maximizing the cyanobacteria’s population density which was corroborated by research. <br><br> These findings can be translated into developing novel approaches for bacterial growth and virulence inhibition, or for potential improvements in biofuel production. The use of electromagnetic wavelength regulation could become a more effective approach to improving biofuel production than the current methods of organism manipulation.

NOVEL RECOMBINANT PIONEER ORAL BACTERIA AS AN HIV VACCINE VECTOR
Emily C. Xie
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), a disease that affects about 33 million people worldwide by weakening the immune system is caused by a virus known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The ultimate goal of the research is to develop an effective vaccine against HIV/AIDS. <br><br> This year’s goal was to test the expression of the HIV protein in recombinant Streptococcus mitis bacteria (S. mitis). Western blotting, a technique used to determine the expression of a protein, was used in a series of experiments to determine whether the HIV protein was expressed in S. mitis. The technique included the nickel column where his-tags were attached to the protein so that it would bind to the column. With the protein in the column, the next step is elution. After collecting samples, a protein gel was run; and, based on the data, confirms that the protein is indeed expressed in S. mitis. Next in importance, antibody response was determined. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common technique used to determine antibody response to a vaccine. First blood samples were tested prior and after vaccination. Then antibodies were added to the sample and after series of washings, data of the samples were collected using an ELISA plate reader. From the results, it indicates that the vaccine is highly immunogenic. <br><br> Further exploration of the use of the recombinant bacterium as an HIV vaccine is needed. Safety and immunogenicity assessments will be needed prior to conducting human clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy of the novel recombinant S. mitis HIV vaccine. Hopefully oral bacteria expressing HIV antigens will be a promising HIV vaccine that will protect perinatal and adult transmission of HIV, thus decreasing the threat of a global AIDS pandemic.<br><br>

MAST CELL PREVENTION OF LIFE-THREATENING BLOOD COAGULATION IN TISSUES: TRYPTASE-HEPARIN COMPLEXES EXOCYTOSED FROM ACTIVATED MAST CELLS HINDER BLOOD COAGULATION INTERNALLY BY PROTEOLYTICALLY DESTROYING FIBRINOGEN
Dominick Zheng
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Despite their adverse roles in numerous inflammatory disorders, the tetramer-forming tryptases stored in the secretory granules of mouse and human mast cells (MCs) have beneficial roles in innate and acquired immunity. The focus of this project was on the anticoagulant activities of human tryptase-beta (hTryptase-beta) and its ortholog mouse MC protease-6 (mMCP-6) when these serine proteases were ionically bound to heparin.<br><br> As assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis, purified fibrinogen was found to be highly susceptible to degradation by recombinant and naturally occurring mMCP-6- and hTryptase-beta-heparin complexes even if the digestion reactions were carried out in the presence of the endogenous protease inhibitors in serum. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that cleavage occurred at Lys575 in the C-terminus of the protein’s alpha chain. A fibrinogenolysis assay was used to evaluate the anticoagulant properties of the two tryptases on human plasma samples. Although porcine heparin is routinely used pharmacologically to prevent coagulation, mMCP-6 and hTryptase-beta were found to be more effective anticoagulants than heparin alone on a weight basis.<br><br> Because of the adverse consequences of fibrin deposits in tissues, these data provide an explanation for why no human has been identified that lacks hTryptase+ MCs, why mice and humans lack a circulating protease inhibitor that rapidly inactivates MC tryptases, and why mammals have two genes encoding functionally similar tryptases that preferentially cleave fibrinogen. The discovery that MC-restricted tryptase-heparin complexes are potent anticoagulants in vitro and in vivo may be useful for developing more effective ways to prevent blood coagulation in the clinic.

THE DISCOVERY OF ANGEDELAMORT: A NOVEL MYCOBACTERIOPHAGE
Meaghan Cailun Scarlett Dunn
The Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky, Bowling Green, KY

Bacteriophages are the most common DNA containing entities on Earth. The goal of this project was to isolate and characterize a novel bacteriophage using the common soil microbe, Mycobacterium smegmatis, as a host. The starting material was a soil sample collected from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Several rounds of purification were performed to obtain uniform plaques. The genomic DNA from the newly identified phage, named AngeDeLaMorte (angel of death), was isolated and analyzed by restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopy revealed AngeDeLaMorte has a long tail. We compared our data to other phages in the mycobacteriophage database and the results suggest that AngeDeLaMort is unique.

A MICROFLUIDIC-BASED SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES A CRITICALLY DEPLETED VASCULOGENIC SUBPOPULATION IN DIABETIC MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS
Shubha Srinivas Raghvendra
Saint Francis High School, Mountain View, CA

Heterogeneity within stem cell populations poses an impediment to the study and therapeutic application of these cells, particularly in the context of disease. Traditional protocols for gene expression analysis pool transcriptomes of entire populations, resulting in an averaged and therefore incomplete picture of transcriptional trends. In an effort to mitigate this issue, we developed a bioinformatic, microfluidic-based single cell analysis for identification of epigenetic alterations among diseased stem cell populations.<br><br> <br><br>Diabetes served as a phenotypic marker of disease as it provided an easily verifiable and well-understood condition. Bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are profoundly affected by diabetes, were harvested from discarded tissue specimen of wild-type and diabetic mice. Massively parallel single-cell qPCR was executed on a microfluidic platform; individual cell-by-cell readouts were normalized and optimally clustered with a fuzzy c-means algorithm, which permits partial cluster membership. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics were applied to quantify transcriptional differences among clusters.<br><br> <br><br>Key vasculogenic and stem-like subpopulations were critically depleted in diabetic MSCs, a trend which was substantiated by in vitro functional assays. This suggests that diabetes affects these progenitors in a highly selective manner, and that key epigenetic alterations in single-cell biology may underlie MSC dysfunction in diabetes.

INTERROGATION OF CANCER: DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL BIOMARKER DISCOVERY TOOL TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL SIGNATURES FROM STATISTICALLY DECONVOLUTED EXPRESSIONS
Natalie Ng
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Objectives: Tissue heterogeneity is a major confounding factor in microarray-based analysis. Gene expression deconvolution methods have been proposed to overcome this problem by decomposing the global gene expression into pure-cell sub-profiles. Differential analysis can be performed on the deconvoluted expressions to identify disease-related genes that may otherwise be undetectable. The primary objectives of this project are (1) design and development of a novel biomarker discovery tool, and (2) development and application of an automated statistical gene expression deconvolution procedure to identify prognostic signatures for breast cancer patients.<br><br>Methods: Microarrays of Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array platform were used in the biomarker discovery workflow. Cell type specific biomarkers were identified using statistical significance tests (ANOVA and TukeyHSD) and up-regulation ratio computation. Gene expression deconvolution was applied to microarray dataset GSE2034, from a published breast cancer study, to identify clinical signatures. An automated deconvolution procedure was developed based on a two-step iterative algorithm implemented in Matlab.<br><br>Results: Biomarkers of immune, stromal, and tumor cell types have been identified and verified. The biomarkers provided biological identification of the deconvoluted expressions to their corresponding cell types. Using deconvolution, gene signatures that can discriminate breast cancer patients according to clinical outcomes (relapse versus relapse-free) have been identified.<br><br>Conclusions/Summary: A novel biomarker discovery tool and an automated deconvolution procedure were developed to analyze global gene expressions of breast tumor samples to identify prognostic gene signatures predictive of clinical outcomes.

EXPLORING GROWTH PATTERNS AND INTELLIGENCE IN AN AMOEBOID ORGANISM
Clara L. Buck
Coral Academy of Science of Las Vegas, Henderson, NV

The purposes of this project are to document the basic growth patterns of the cellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum and explore the maze solving abilities documented previously. The research tests the hypothesis that the growth of Physarum polycephalum will be more vigorous in warm, dark conditions and that slime mold generally will select the shorter path between two food sources in a maze.<br><br>Physarum polycephalum from a commercial supply company was cultured on non-nutrient two percent agar in Petri dishes. Oatmeal flakes were placed in the dishes and growth observed over time under different light and temperature conditions. Simple mazes were then constructed with multiple pathways of different lengths. Organisms were placed in the maze and oatmeal flakes put in opposite ends of the maze after the organism had filled it. The specimens were then monitored over several days. The cultures kept in indirect daylight grew slightly more than those that were kept in the dark. <br><br>Temperature had a tremendous effect on growth. The cultures kept at 68-72 degrees Fahrenheit (room temperature) grew vigorously to fill the Petri dishes within the six day period, while those kept at 48 degrees Fahrenheit moved very little. The specimens in the mazes tended to back out of longer paths, but then re-explored them after a short time. The organism tends to back out of longer paths and then often re-explores these paths after some time, but it is unclear if Physarum can identify the minimum length solution to a simple maze.

IN VITRO INHIBITION OF ECORI METHYLTRANSFERASE BY EPIGALLOCATECHIN-GALLATE
Jan-alfred S Aquino
Bayonne High School, Bayonne, NJ

DNA methyltransferases attach a methyl group to cytosine or adenine bases in DNA. In prokaryotes, methylation is a defense mechanism against endonuclease digestion; endonuclease enzymes do not digest methylated DNA. The drug, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibits cytosine-binding methyltransferases. Given this, it could be predicted that EGCG would also inhibit an adenine-binding methyltransferase (EcoRI) in vitro. The test for this extracted EGCG from green tea, isolated plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli, and prepared corresponding EcoRI restriction enzyme and adenine-binding EcoRI methyltransferase. Through a series of methylations, digestions, and agarose gel electrophoreses, it can be concluded that EGCG does in fact inhibit the EcoRI methyltransferase. A protein sequence alignment of methyltransferase enzymes, however, reveals that the statistically insignificant protein similarities between A-binding and C-binding methyltransferases do not explain the inhibition. Instead, the structural similarities of the universal cofactor S-Adenosyl Methionine and EGCG are most likely the cause of the inhibited methylation reaction. Using this data, future experiments could include the conduction of the experiment in vivo to test for the effect of inhibition in living organisms. In prokaryotes, inhibition could lead to the development of novel antibiotics. In eukaryotes, the inhibition leaves the potential for epigenetic cancer therapy.

IN SILICO ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL IMPACT OF NSSNPS IN GENES INVOLVED IN IBD
Howard Feng
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, Ontario, CANADA

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is associated with frequent abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and need for surgery. The disease affects as many as 2.5 million individuals in North America alone. Recent evidence suggests that a combination of genetic predisposition in an individual together with altered bacterial composition in their gut both contribute to disease. The protein NADPH oxidase, which has been linked to IBD, has anti-bacterial function. It is comprised of 7 subunits which must properly bind together to prevent inflammation. Genetic mutations in these subunits in the form of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) may weaken their binding affinity to one another and cause disease. Therefore, it is crucial to identify deleterious nsSNPs and characterize their contribution to IBD. In this study, focus was placed on two major subunits of NADPH oxidase: neutrophil cytosol factor 4 (NCF4) and 2 (NCF2). 64 known nsSNPs within NCF4 and NCF2 were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The potential functional impact of these nsSNPs on the subunits was evaluated by 3 different computer algorithms. A total of 20 nsSNPs within NCF4 and NCF2 were predicted to be damaging. Further bioinformatic scrutiny indicated that 5 of these 20 nsSNPs likely alter the protein’s three-dimensional structure, solvent accessibility, and thermodynamic stability substantially and, hence, negatively impact its anti-inflammatory function. The potential deleterious effects of these nsSNPs make them priority candidates for future in vitro and in vivo IBD genetic studies.

COMBINED ANTITUMOR EFFECT OF CETUXIMAB AND DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID IN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE HEAD AND NECK
Chareeni Eesha Kurukulasuriya
Pittsburgh Allderdice High School, Pittsburgh, PA

Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific chimeric monoclonal antibody used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). However, clinical response is only seen in 10-20% of patients. Since the mechanism behind this variability in patient response is still undetermined, there is an interest in finding ways to enhance the efficacy of cetuximab. Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been shown to inhibit tumor progression and cell proliferation. Recent studies suggest that DHA can modify EGFR signaling through manipulation of lipid rafts on the cell surface. Here, the effects of combining DHA and cetuximab treatments on cell proliferation, apoptosis, EGFR expression, and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) were studied using an EGFR-positive SCCHN cell line UM-SCC-22B. Cetuximab in combination with DHA reduced cell proliferation better than DHA or cetuximab alone. While DHA upregulated EGFR phosphorylation, combination treatment with cetuximab counteracted this effect. Pre-treatment of tumor cells with DHA increased cetuximab-mediated ADCC with effector cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from a healthy donor. These findings show that co-administration of DHA and cetuximab enhances the anti-tumor effects that these treatments have alone. Ultimately, DHA supplementation has the potential to improve clinical response to cetuximab.

OVER EXPRESSION OF MIRNA IN FIBROBLAST CELL LINE MODIFIES THEIR FIBROTIC PROPERTIES
Alicia Nicole Grabiec
Freeport Area Senior High School, Sarver, PA

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive disease of uncertain etiology characterized by an epithelial-mesenchymal shift (EMS) that causes fibrosis of the interstitium of the lungs. The median survival time of patients with IPF is 3-5 years due to the ineffective treatment options currently available. IPF positive cells have a distinct microRNA expression which regulates a specific gene expression that characterizes the disease. Previous research has identified down regulated microRNAs in IPF and has shown that transfection of human fetal lung fibroblast (HFLF) cells with let7-d, one such microRNA, has resulted in a decrease in EMS. Therefore, it will be determined whether or not the transfection of miR30b, another down regulated microRNA in IPF, will alter the expression of fibrotic properties of HFLF cells. It is hypothesized that a successful transfection of miR30b into HFLF cells will result in the down regulation of fibrotic activity and a decrease in EMS. To examine this hypothesis HFLF cells were transfected with miR30b, subjected to real-time PCR, examined for EMS markers, and scratch assayed. Transfection of mir30-b was successful as noted by Cy-3 dye uptake. miR30b transfection into HFLF cells significantly reduced their expression of mesenchymal markers such aSMA, Ncad, and FSP1, while slightly increasing the expression of epithelial marker Zo-1 suggesting a reduction in EMS and fibrotic properties. Scratch assays confirmed that miR30b reduced fibrotic wound healing. In conclusion, transfection with miR30b successfully decreased the EMS and fibrosis associated with IPF and should be further examined as a possible therapy IPF.

EVALUATING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LRRK2 AND N-MAP AS A PATHWAY TO NEURONAL DEGENERATION IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Raymond Zhu
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, decreasing the quality of life of approximately 1.5 million patients in the United States. Mutations in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene (first described in 2004) have now emerged as the most important genetic link to both autosomal dominant and sporadic PD. However, the protein-protein interactions and pathways involved in LRRK2-mediated signaling still remain poorly defined. By co-transfecting human recombinant expression constructs of LRRK2 (wild type, G2019S, or R1441C mutants) and N-MAP (a human Novel Microtubule Associated Protein) into HEK 293T and COS7 cells, our data sheds light on a previously unknown interaction between LRRK2 and N-MAP, as well as its effect on the microtubule network in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal that LRRK2 binds most frequently to N-MAP-Light Chain (LC), which is formed when N-MAP is cleaved in vitro. At the same time, LRRK2 also binds to N-MAP-Heavy Chain and Full Length though with less prevalence. The results of immunofluorescence microscopy show that N-MAP, particularly N-MAP-Light Chain (LC), co-localizes to microtubules with LRRK2-WT. LRRK2 genetic mutants G2019S and R1441C also seem to interact with N-MAP; however, this interaction appeared to decrease N-MAP’s solubility and causes it to release from microtubules. This release may create a variety of problems, including disruptions in the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway and the process of autophagy, which ultimately lead to cellular degeneration and death. Our results present a new approach for future research in regard to understanding PD pathology, and eventually, to finding a cure.

PANCREATIC CANCER DIFFERENTIATION MARKERS IDENTIFY RISK GROUPS
Ryan Dz-Wei Chow
Leland High School, San Jose, CA

Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of all cancers, with only 4% of patients surviving five years after diagnosis; 95% of pancreatic cancers are classified as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although initial events of tumorigenesis accumulate at the stem cell level, the enriched cell type varies from tumor to tumor, leading to various tumor types. Looking to further our understanding of PDAC, I hypothesized that tumors of varying gene expression patterns differ in aggressiveness, leading to differential prognoses. <br><br> I utilized Boolean logic on microarray gene expression data to first build a model for a PDAC developmental pathway. There are strong Boolean implication relationships between DSG3, KRT17 and KRT20: DSG3high implies KRT17high, KRT17high implies KRT20low, and DSG3high implies KRT20low. These relationships defined three expression groups (in order of hypothesized increasing differentiation): DSG3+KRT17+KRT20–, DSG3–KRT17+KRT20–, and DSG3–KRT17–KRT20+. When analyzed with patient survival data, prognosis improved along with increasing differentiation (p=0.0029). DSG3, KRT17 and KRT20 still maintained their prognostic capabilities in survival analysis stratified by pathological stage. <br><br> Consequently, the PDAC differentiation model and my original hypothesis were supported. Future work involves testing the new developmental hierarchy through tumorigenic potential assays and PDAC tissue microarrays.

DEVELOPING LYMPHOLAB: MATHEMATICAL MODELING IONIC FLUXES IN T-LYMPHOCYTES
Benjamin Edward Jin
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA

Mathematical models describing biological systems are useful to predict how these systems will act under different conditions. In my project, I constructed a mathematical model named LymphoLab to describe and predict major ionic currents required for activating a naïve T-lymphocyte, an important step in cell-mediated immunity. Data regarding the kinetics of the pertinent calcium channels and pumps, such as CRAC, PMCA, and SERCA, and the potassium channels Kv1.3 and KCa3.1, were gathered from patch-clamp experiments and from published papers. Using these data, a state diagram and a subsequent system of differential equations were constructed for each channel. These equations were then solved using the MatLab© program, and combined together to model the current through each of the individual channels as well as through the entire cell during the activation period. Tracings generated from this model were found to reproduce my experimental patch clamp data as well as the published data, supporting the accuracy of my model. This program is novel and practical, as it can be used for in silico experimentation to predict how T-lymphocytes will respond to drugs of different actions and potencies. This will be useful in the drug discovery process for conditions involving T-lymphocyte activation, including autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection. <br><br>

INVESTIGATING VARIATION IN SEROTONIN 1E RECEPTOR GENES IN A POLYMORPHIC SPECIES, ZONOTRICHIA ALBICOLLIS
Emma Sperry
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

The 5-HT receptor system is a series of 14 serotonin receptors including the 5-HT 1e receptor gene. Serotonin has been correlated with aggression and sexual behavior in a variety of species. The white-throated sparrow (WTSP) was selected for analysis of its 5-HT 1e gene due to an unusual chromosomal feature of that gene. Twenty-one WTSP DNA samples were used in this study along with three primers, SERO 1, 2 and 3 which were created from the 5-HT 1e BAC clone. PCR reactions were done for each sample using each primer. After sequencing of the PCR products, the sequences were examined and the three primers were merged in order to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The sequences were translated to amino acids to look for nonsynonymous SNPs. Eight SNPs were found across the WTSP samples. Two of these SNPs appeared to be nearly nonsynonymous after the amino acid translation. The 5-HT 1e gene is highly conserved in the WTSP. These nonsynonymous SNPs are significant because they most likely correlate with behavioral differences since the 1e gene is highly conserved. Future study would include an analysis of behavioral data with located SNPs in the WTSP.

DETERMINING THE ROLE OF THALAMIC NEUROTROPHIN-3 ON NEOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURON DEVELOPMENT
Miguel Ignacio Paredes
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of thalamic neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) on neocorticogenesis after corticothalmic innervation. This was tested by analyzing gene expression of DCX and Bhlhb5 after NT-3 was added to neuroblastoma cells and by examining the morphology of golgi-stained brain sections from wildtype mice and Nt-3/Crh-Cre conditional knockout mice in which NT-3 was silenced from the dorsal-medial nuclei of the thalamus, from which the thalamocortico afferents arise. When the neuroblastomas were incubated with 50ng/mL of NT-3 for 48hours, a significant increase in the expression of Bhlhb5, which regulates the accusation of a post-mitotic neuronal identity, was seen, suggesting a role of thalamic NT-3 in the post-mitotic development of projection neurons. Furthermore, when NT-3 was silenced in the thalamus, five out of the six dendrite morphological parameters in the neocortical projection neurons were significantly reduced, showing reductions in complexity ranging from 42% to over 85%, supporting the gene expression results. In this study, thalamic NT-3’s vital role in the development of cortical projection neurons was defined as a propagator of dendrites and promoter of normal morphology, highlighting the integral role of corticothalamic innervations in these processes. These results also highlight a novel pathway that may help to better understand the emergence of neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where abnormalities in thalamocortical innervation and dendritic complexity are present. Since NT-3-dependent pathways are important in this regard, this suggests that it may be a novel, potential therapeutic target for such disorders.

UNLOCKING THE GENEIUS BEHIND TELOMERASE CONTROL
Eisha Amina Ahmed
Abbey Park High School, Oakville, Ontario, CANADA

The study of the relationship between cell division, telomerase activity, and cellular proliferation potential is a relatively new area of research, with the Nobel prize for medicine being awarded in 2009 for the discovery of telomerase. In normal somatic cells, the entire process of telomerase control is unknown. The purpose of this investigation is to determine potential genes linked to telomerase expression and cellular proliferation potential in human somatic cells.<br><br> Using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) databases from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP), numerous genes and their corresponding levels of gene expression were compared in various tissues. Cells of particular interest include brain and muscle cells (low proliferation potential), stomach, esophagus, and skin cells (high proliferation potential), and embryonic stem cells (indefinite proliferation potential). Levels of expression were analyzed by comparing the number of cDNA tags for each gene across these tissues. Through the processes of elimination and logical deduction, fifteen genes with the potential to be related to cellular proliferation potential and telomerase activity were isolated. Of these genes, two novel genes (Unigene codes Hs.562717 and Hs.476965) were identified.<br><br> Understanding the biological process of telomerase control can prove invaluable in understanding both the aging process and various cancers. Isolating genes and proteins of interest can be a potential target in future cancer therapies. Further laboratory analysis is necessary to test predictions made by this computational analysis.

THE INSUFFICIENCY OF BIOMARKERS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF BREAST CANCER STEM CELLS: HYBRID SPHEROIDS AS AN ALTERNATIVE ASSAY
Talal Syed
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

As cancer therapy is moving towards targeted cancer stem cell therapy, the need for an accurate assay to identify and isolate pure cancer stem cell populations has become greater. Modern approaches to identifying cancer stem cells (CSCs) for research and for targeting in treatment have been centered on the use of biomarkers, or protein markers which are found on the surfaces of cells and are used to isolate CSCs based on their expressed phenotypes. However, in correlation with the increasing number of failing clinical trials in the field, it has been hypothesized that perhaps biomarkers are not the most efficient and accurate method that can be used for the isolation of CSCs. The purpose of this experiment was to design a novel assay, the Hybrid Spheroid Assay (HSA), which could be used to test the validity of biomarkers and would be able to provide an alternative method for isolating and identifying CSCs. It was demonstrated using the HSA on patient derived breast tumor cells that only a small subset of cells (~1%) isolated using biomarkers were actually CSCs that fit the functional definition of a CSC. The results from the experiment show that the biomarker assay is an inefficient assay for the identification and isolation of CSCs. The assay has also shown, in several other experiments, to have potential in being able to predict outcomes of clinical trials and in predicting outcomes on individual patient therapies.

BISPHENOL A (BPA) PROMOTES ADIPOGENESIS IN 3T3-L1 CELLS
Bansri Manesh Patel
Sussex Technical High School, Georgetown, DE

With the current obesity epidemic, concerns have been raised about the widespread use of the chemical Bisphenol A (BPA), found in plastic bottles, canned foods, dental sealants, etc. and its potential contribution to obesity. Using the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line as an in vitro cell model, I investigated the effects of BPA on adipogenesis, a process of fat production by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes (fat cells).<br><br> First, BPA’s ability to promote adipogenesis was assessed using 3T3-L1 cells exposed to either BPA and insulin or insulin alone for four days (insulin was the trigger for adipogenesis). Next, it was determined whether adipogenesis exhibited a dose-dependent response to BPA at five different concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 100 µM, two of which were physiologically relevant. Effects of BPA were assessed by triglyceride (TG) content and the presence of lipid droplets, both markers of adipogenesis. TG content of cell samples was determined with a colorimetric assay. Oil Red O staining provided a qualitative assessment of lipid droplets.<br><br> The data suggest that BPA in combination with insulin significantly promotes adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, although more replicates are needed to determine whether effects are dose-dependent. A particularly worrisome finding is that effects were most pronounced in cells exposed to the physiologically relevant dose of 0.04 µM BPA, displaying a 276% increase in TG content. Considering that levels of human exposure to BPA are often higher than 0.04 µM, the impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA on the obesity epidemic may be significant.

CHARACTERIZING THE LAST UNIVERSAL COMMON ANCESTOR OF LIFE
Justin Krish Williams
Henry W. Grady High School, Atlanta, GA

The recent explosion of sequenced genomes allows us to begin to answer important questions about ancient life on earth, nearly four billion years ago. We can use modern sequences to trace the threads that link extant biology to LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor of Life). The top scientists in the field of ancient evolution, including Koonin, Gogarten, Logan and Pace have differing views on the gene set of LUCA. Koonin believes that the gene set of LUCA is mostly restricted to the translational machinery, which has been passed down vertically to extant systems. He interprets his phylogenetic analysis to indicate that the gene set of LUCA was composed of about 600 genes, 50 of which are involved in translation and have been passed down vertically to all extant organisms (Koonin, 2003). Pace believes that LUCA had genes involved the processes of translation, transcription, replication, and protein modification. He however agrees with Koonin’s estimate of about 50 conserved translation genes in extant biology (Pace, 2002). Logan seems to agree with Koonin. Gogarten agees with Koonin and Logan about the translational machinery although his research is more focused on the gene set before LUCA (Gogarten, 2010). Our goal here is to identify the gene set of LUCA and the lineages of modern genes. Using known biochemical pathways (Voet 2003), we identified key proteins. We obtained the sequences of those proteins from a series of organisms in all three branches of the canonical tree of life. We have developed statistical/graphic methods for determining lineages. We have used these methods to test the hypothesis of post LUCA extinction of entire metabolic pathways, which were supplanted by new pathways, acquired by HGT.

ROLE OF EPIDERMAL HIF-1A IN THE INFLAMMATORY AND ANGIOGENIC RESPONSE TO ISCHEMIA IN DIABETIC WOUND HEALING
Revanth Sai Kosaraju
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

Impaired wound healing due to diabetes is an enormous medical and economic burden on society and the individual. The dermis and epidermis have distinct roles in ischemic wound healing, and research has demonstrated the importance of dermal hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (Hif-1a), a transcription factor impaired by diabetes, to angiogenesis and cellular recruitment. However, the role of epidermal Hif-1a and its impairment in diabetes remain elusive. Accordingly, the goal of this research was threefold: to determine whether epidermal Hif-1a is impaired by diabetes, to ascertain whether it is a master regulator of wound healing, and lastly, to define its specific role in wound healing, if it was determined that it regulated wound repair. Control, diabetic, and Hif-1a-knockout (HK) keratinocytes were profiled for Hif-1a and target gene expression using qRT-PCR, western blot, and ELISAs. Cell proliferation was assessed with Ki-67 immunocytochemistry and two computational algorithms written by the researcher. Ischemic wound tissues from control and HK mice were analyzed for inflammatory cell recruitment and angiogenic marker secretion using immunohistochemistry and ELISAs. Results revealed attenuated transcription and protein stabilization of Hif-1a in diabetic keratinocytes (p<<0.05) and dysregulated expression of inflammatory and angiogenic target genes in HK keratinocytes (p<0.05). Furthermore, wound tissues from HK mice showed diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells and reduced angiogenic marker secretion. These findings indicate that epidermal Hif-1a is a crucial mediator of inflammation and angiogenesis in wound healing and is impaired by diabetes, revealing that topical targeting of this protein could be a novel approach for treating diabetic wounds.<br><br>

SAFETY OF LIPOXIN A4 (LXA4) AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR LUNG INFLAMMATION
Akansha Jain
Millard North High School, Omaha, NE

When poly-unsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) are biosynthesized in the body they become lipid mediators that modulate important physiological functions. Pro-resolving lipid mediators are released in response to tissue injury to stimulate cells involved in the immune response and stop an immune response when it is no longer needed. Decreased production of lipid mediators exposes the host to protracted inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that hog dust extract(HDE) from swine confinement facilities can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to see whether LXA4 could be a safe treatment for lung inflammation. The Trypan Blue Exclusion test was performed to determine the number of viable epithelial cells present in untreated cells and cells exposed to HDE/LXA4. This test is based on the principle that live cells possess intact cell membranes that exclude certain dyes. The results showed that there was no affect of HDE and LXA4 on the viability of the cells. Additionally, MTT proliferation assays were performed to quantify the changes in proliferation between HDE-treated cells and HDE + LXA4 -treated cells. The MTT proliferation assays showed that epithelial cells exposed to hog dust had similar levels of proliferation as the epithelial cells exposed to hog dust and LXA4 but after 24 hours there was a statistically significant decrease in the levels of proliferation of the cells exposed to HDE+LXA4. These findings suggest LXA4 is safe to epithelial cells and therefore holds promise as a potential therapeutic treatment for lung inflammation.

INHIBITING CLASS A SCAVENGER RECEPTOR IN ANTIGEN FACILITATED ACTIVATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL AUTOIMMUNE THERAPY
Matthew Joseph Bruck
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

The purpose of this study was to better classify the mechanisms involved in cell activation in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases to develop more effective treatments. It is founded on the premise that autoreactive B lymphocytes presenting self-antigen initiate autoimmune responses, focusing on a specific receptor, class A scavenger receptor (SR-A). Two murine cell populations were used for comparison: wild type control cells expressing SR-A and experimental SR-A deficient cells. Flow cytometry was used to compare the uptake of fluorescently labeled antigen in the two cell populations. Results indicate that eliminating SR-A from the cells significantly decreased their ability to accept and process antigen. The goal of the study then shifted to inhibiting SR-A using certain small molecules. To identify relevant molecules, a high throughput screen was performed, which tested each one’s relative ability to disrupt the binding of SR-A ligands. Next, the movement of antigen was monitored in small molecule treated and untreated groups. This experiment was performed in vitro and in vivo in both mouse and human models. Lastly, the effects of the small molecules on T cell activation and proliferation were measured using a cell stain. Several small molecules proved effective at blocking ligand binding, antigen transfer, and T cell activation. Two in particular, tannic acid and sennoside B, stood out by demonstrating consistently high levels of inhibition. Whereas current autoimmune drugs destroy total immune cell populations, this research focuses on deactivating a specific receptor, while maintaining the integrity of the immune system.

A NOVEL ASSAY TO SCREEN FOR ANTI-CANCER AGENTS TARGETING RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE RON
Andrea Maren Evans
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

An overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase RON (recepteur d’origine nantais) has been associated with many human cancer cell lines, including colon, breast, and pancreatic. Reduction of RON can be considered a mechanism for future anti-cancer drugs. I have designed and tested a new assay that will determine whether new therapeutic agents can decrease RON expression and potentially inhibit cancer development. First, an in vitro proliferation study was developed to test three colon cancer cell lines: HCT 116 (cells with high levels of RON), HCT116-shRON (cells with short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of RON), and HCT116-shSCR (control short hairpin scramble cells). RON inhibitors were used as an additional control. Proliferation was determined using a spectrophotometric assay. Second, an in vivo study utilizing HCT116-shRON and HCT116-shSCR cell lines quantified tumor growth after 35 days by luciferase bioluminescence. Tumor growth after 35 days was quantified by luciferase bioluminescence. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that reducing RON expression in colon cancer cells effectively slowed cell proliferation and overall tumor growth respectively. These results indicate that targeting RON reduction may lead to future anti-cancer drugs, and that my assay appears to be a valid method for testing the efficacy of potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents.

OPTIMIZING 3D CELLULAR SCAFFOLDS USING COLLAGEN AND GELATIN
Briana Noel Cowles
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

The purpose of experimentation is to find a suitable substrate/matrix for cell attachment and use a mechanical means to produce a 3D growth of cells, and ascertain whether these materials can be folded to surround the growing cells to create a 3D structure.<br><br> The independent variables for Phase I (toxicity test) of experimentation include collagen, gelatin, and cell types (liver cells and neurons). Gelatin and collagen were measured in a high (.1%), a medium (.01%), and a low (.001%) concentration. Independent variables for Phase II (forming 3D structures) include: increments of time (48 and 96 hours) and cell types. Dependent variables were a live cell count, size and location of produced 3D structure, and location of structure. For Phase I, cells were cultured in appropriate media and allowed to incubate overnight. Designated volumes of treatments to the well plates were then applied. The control group contained neither IV. Effects of both treatments on each cell type were compared. In Phase II, collagen and gelatin were added to the cell types and added to rotator. After completion of trials, cells were viewed under a Confocal Lens Microscope. <br><br>The results of experimentation imply that both collagen and gelatin are optimal scaffolds and can assist in the agglomeration. Both IVs had the best reaction in the cell lines when used at the 0.01% level. The degrees of freedom for all trials were 3. The P-value was 0.0000 for all treatments except neurons treated with gelatin which had a P-value was 0.013.

PAX 9 GENE VARIATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NUMBERS OF WISDOM TEETH
Kyle Tadao Yoshida
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

The functions of the PAX 9 gene were studied to find a relationship between three exons of PAX 9 and wisdom tooth occurrence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were located to find if exons in PAX 9 is related specifically to variation in wisdom teeth. PAX 9 is a homeobox gene related to skeletal and molar formation including dentition. Mutations in this gene have been related to the cause of severe dental agenesis including oligodontia. Wisdom teeth do not show up in about 20% of the population and are the most common congenitally missing teeth, however, from this investigation, half of the population was missing one or more wisdom teeth. DNA from 28 human subjects were amplified by PCR for PAX 9, and compared to find SNPs. There was no correlation found between SNPs in PAX 9, exon 3 or 4, and ethnicities or numbers of wisdom teeth from the sample population. A comparison between tooth frequencies and ethnicities showed that the Japanese population had the highest frequency of missing wisdom teeth. A larger sample population would be needed to confirm findings of this study. The PAX 9 gene does not appear to affect missing wisdom teeth.

ALTERED LIPID-PROTEIN LOCALIZATION IN NIEMANN-PICK DISEASE TYPE C
Sarah Catherine Briann Baker
Penn High School, Mishawaka, IN

Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by missense mutations in the proteins NPC1 and NPC2. These proteins are found on the membranes and interiors of endosomes and lysosmes and are involved in the metabolism, transportation, and localization of cholesterol. The NPC mutations therefore result in the buildup and improper storage of excess cholesterol. However, other than the mishandling of cholesterol, little else is understood about NPC. Drugs that lower cholesterol have no impact on NPC, suggesting a more complex relationship between lipid handling and NPC. Yet whether other proteins or lipids are affected by the NPC mutations is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, the localization of three lipid-handling proteins, FAPP1, ARF1, and LactC2, was examined in NPC cells. A recombinant plasmid that linked the DNA for each protein to a fluorescent reporter protein was purified and transected into NPC cells. The localization of the resulting fusion protein was determined by confocal microscopy. The localization of FAPP1 and ARF1 in the NPC cells did not differ from their localization in healthy cells, indicating that FAPP1 and ARF1 are not correlated with NPC. However, there was a difference in the localization of LactC2. In a healthy cell LactC2 is localized to the plasma membrane where it interacts with the lipid phosphatidylserine to send cellular signals. In NPC cells, however, LactC2 was found at the Golgi and ER, suggesting that improper localization of LactC2 may be related to NPC. Future work will involve exploring this possible relationship.

EXPRESSION PROFILING OF Y CHROMOSOME GENES AT EMBRYO, LARVA AND ADULT STAGES OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Bersan Ozcan
Ankara Science Lycee, Ankara, TURKEY

The Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of many genetic studies, but its genetic properties and organization have mainly remained a mystery. Some of the previous researches showed that male organisms without Y chromosome exhibit excellent viability although the Y chromosome of D. melanogaster regulates the activity of hundreds of genes harbored on other chromosomes. This contradiction suggests that Y chromosomes of these organisms may not be transcribed at all life stages. Therefore we investigated whether Y-linked genes are transcribed in all of three developmental stages –embryo, larva and adult- of D. melanogaster.<br><br>In this study, major methods were RNA isolation, reverse transcription, PCR and gel electrophoresis. In order to select primers that were used for subsequent experiments, optimization experiment was carried on adults since this stage is probably the most active stage for the transcription of Y-linked genes. It was shown that Su(ste), psi1, LLY, pry and psi3 genes are active in adult samples. It was also demonstrated in the optimization experiment that Su(ste), psi1 and psi3 primers were working optimally on adults.<br><br>When these 3 selected primers were analyzed on the larva and embryo experiments, psi3 and Su(ste) genes were seen as active genes on larvae while no detectable gene expressions were seen for embryos. As a result, Su(ste) and psi3 primers were defined as mutual Y-specific markers for larvae and adults since these genes are active in both. Even though Su(ste) primer was used with its optimum PCR conditions -which was an additional result from this study- on embryo samples, no gene expressions were observed. As a result of this study, we couldn’t detect any continuous Y-linked gene expressions throughout three life stages.

TRANSLOCATION OF HDAC6 DURING OXIDATIVE STRESS
Joshua Leon Burdoo
Tucson Magnet High School, Tucson, AZ

Oxidative stress is a condition that occurs in cells due to stress from the environment, aging, and disease. Oxidative stress has been connected to various conditions and diseases ranging from neurodegenerative diseases to various cancers. Recent study has begun to map out the cellular response to oxidative and theoretical treatments involving the oxidative stress response have been proposed within the last 10 years.<br><br> Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an enzyme identified as a key<br><br> component of the oxidative stress response. HDAC6 is known to regulate important stress response proteins including Nrf2. HDAC6 has been connected to pancreatic cancer’s resistance to chemotherapy and a possible target for the treatment Alzheimer’s disease. However, HDAC6’s function and role have not been completely mapped out.<br><br> This research aims to determine if HDAC6 moves from its location in cytoplasm during arsenic induced stress, and if so, were to and what HDAC6 utilizes. By performing an immunocytochemistry targeting HDAC6 and the transportation protein β-tubulin, the two proteins were found to co-localize to the perinuclear space, suggesting β-tubulin way be responsible for the movement. This data can be used do develop a deeper understanding of HDAC6 allowing future research to find ways of manipulating HDAC6.

THE EFFECT OF CODON OPTIMIZATION ON TY1 TRANSPOSITION: UNDERSTANDING MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS THAT EXIST IN THE GENOME OF MOST ORGANISMS
Elias Maximilian Weston-Farber
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD

Transposons are small genetic elements that exist within the DNA of their host and are capable of duplicating and inserting themselves into a new location within the DNA of their host’s genome (transposition). These genetic elements are currently hypothesized to be the precursors to viruses and have played a significant role in human evolution. In order to study the structure of these rogue genetic elements and better understand the factors that influence their ability to replicate within the genome, I focused on the most abundant yeast transposon, Ty1. Previous work was done on the Ty1 by recoding its DNA sequence to look for important regulatory regions; however these regions were never identified. My work shows the recoded Ty1 exhibited reduced transposition efficiency, suggesting the existence of domains of Ty1 that negatively affect transposition when recoded. Furthermore, I have narrowed down the location(s) of the important regulatory area(s) that may cause the Ty1’s decrease in transposition efficiency to a 200bp long domain on the Ty1 sequence, which is a mere 3.3% of the entire Ty1. I also created a new protocol to test a retrotransposon’s ability to transpose. I am now significantly closer to describing how Ty1 regulates its transposition.

DISCOVERY OF A MECHANISM FOR THE GLUCOCORTICOID CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE IN CANCER
Benjamin Tyler Cobb, Conor Moran, 
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

Dexamethasone is a chemotherapy aid that negates certain side effects of chemotherapy and is administered 89% of the time during chemotherapy treatment. It is a cortisol agonist 40X the potency of the stress given naturally secreted cortisol. From our last year's experimentation, we found that dexamethasone and stress levels of cortisol cause the cancer cells to increase 4x resistance to cisplatin chemotherapy, thereby increasing cancer recurrence. For our current study we hypothesized that our L929 mouse fibroblast lung cancer cells, become resistant to the chemotherapy because glucocorticoids are increasing the rate of chemotherapy drug efflux by ABC multi-drug resistant transporters. We thus measured the multidrug resistant transporter efflux of a fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33342 with or without cortisol treatment. Using our modified ImageJ analysis we found that the cortisol treated cancer cells effluxed H33342 at a four times greater extent than underrated cells. We then used qRT-PCR (Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction), to determine if the efflux was due to an increase in ABC multi-drug transporter gene expression or transporter activity. Stress levels of cortisol caused an 80 fold increase in the gene expression of one type of the ABC multi-drug transporters compared to beta actin, statistically supporting our hypothesis. Next, we will extend our methods to breast cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines. Also, we will use a Quick Cell Proliferation Assay. We will test a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist, Compound A for its ability to inhibit inflammatory responses, but not stimulate chemotherapy efflux. If so, it would be suitable substitute for dexamethasone.

EFFECT OF VENOMS EXTRACTED FROM WALTERINNASIA AEGYPTIA AND ECHIS COLORATUS SNAKES ON THE INDUCTION OF GROWTH ARREST OF COLON CANCER CELLS
Maysoor Hassan Amin, Mohannad Hasan Amin, 
Manarat Al-Riyadh, Riyadh, Central, SAUDI ARABIA

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide health problem and is considered as one of the most prevalent causes of cancer mortality. Saudi Arabian patients are more likely to present with CRC at an advanced stage of the disease and at younger ages when compared to western populations. There is an urgent need for the development of novel generation of anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity. In this context, the present research was to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of venoms extracted from indigenous snakes, Echis coloratus and Walterinnasia aegyptia, on the growth arrest of colon cancer cells. Venom from Echis coloratus but not of Walterinnasia aegyptia significantly induced apoptosis in LoVo, HTC-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines using Annexin V/PI kit and flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, venom from Echis coloratus obviously and significantly altered the cell cycle of all these cell lines by increasing sub-G1 phase (apoptotic cells), delaying G0/G1 phase and decreasing S phase using PI single stain and flow cytometry analysis. The effect of this venom on the cell cycle was dependent on the up-regulation of P53 expression and down-regulation of Cyclin D1 expression as measured by Western blot. This venom decreased the production of interleukin 6(IL-6), which is the most metastatic protien, from these colon cancer cells using ELISA analysis. In conclusion, The initial use of this animal toxin demonstrated that snake venoms induce growth arrest of colon cancer cells, offering a novel innovative therapeutic strategy.

MYSTERIES OF THE PROTEIN UNIVERSE: PREDICTING FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF PROTEINS
Tina Quynh-Huong Doan, Jerry Feng, Kenneth T. Shiao
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

Hypothetical proteins whose functions are unknown are an obstacle in understanding, reconstructing, and optimizing metabolic machinery for use in genetic modification and other applications. An efficient computational framework was constructed to determine the functional roles of these proteins. This method, the Protein Connectivity Network (PCN), generates a “network” via virtual connections linking protein fragments from a database based on the similarity between their amino acid sequences. A target protein is divided into fragments and integrated into the network. The path formed by the target protein fragments in the network is walked to arrive at fragments bearing the most suitable annotation. Although this method can be applied to elucidate any sequenced genome, the bacteria Clostridium thermocellum (Ct) was chosen as the model organism. The two main reasons for this choice are Ct’s potential for biofuel production and that approximately 30% of Ct genes lack any functional characterization. <br><br>Annotations for Ct’s hypothetical genes were obtained using PCN graphs generated from three protein databases. Comparisons were made between annotations obtained by conventional methods. The annotations were also validated through functional link validation through metabolic pathways. Proteins in the same pathway generally have similar functions, so any protein whose annotation is different should be further researched in order to determine if the given annotation is faulty or not. It was found that a majority of hypothetical proteins were assigned annotations, and a large fraction, about 90%, of those assignments made sense in terms of the functional link validation. Also, the study led to hundreds of new functional assignments that warrant direct experimental confirmation

MINING ACTIVE NATURAL PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL MEDICINAL PLANTS BY USING MOLECULAR POSITIONING SYSTEM
Yuxi Jiang
No.2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, Shanghai, CHINA

Discovering active natural products and medicinal plants is of most significance for human health, but it is a formidable task to the present methods and technologies. In this study, I developed an intelligent discovery technology called molecular positioning system (MPS) by combing molecular similarity search, natural product chemistry and bioassay. MPS is much more effective than the traditional approaches (e.g. extraction + random screening) in identifying active natural products and potential medicinal plants. By employing MPS, I took the anti-lung cancer drug Iressa(TM<br><br>) as the template molecule to search two natural product databases containing thousands of compounds and identified 27 natural products with similar structures to Iressa. Notably, 6 natural products were proven by enzymatic assays to have potent inhibitory activities against the lung cancer target c-Met. The most prominent compound could inhibit c-Met with an IC50 value of 91.4 nM. Meanwhile, all the alcohol extractions of the five medicinal plants containing these active compounds also showed inhibitory activities against c-Met. Remarkably, for the first time, I found that Premna microphylla Turcz has anti-cancer effect and its alcohol extraction of 0.25 mg/mL could inhibit c-Met with an inhibitory ratio of 80.7%. Moreover, this plant has been used as traditional medicine in treating other diseases and as food in China, thus it is safe enough and worth to be developed further. Guided by MPS, I only tested five plants rather than thousands of plants and discovered a new potential medicinal plant. All these results demonstrated that MPS is an effective method in discovering natural medicines and can be widely applicable in discovering new medicinal plants based on the knowledge of existing drugs.

2-DEOXYGLUCOSE DECREASES SORAFENIB EFFECT BY PRO-SURVIVAL PATHWAY IN MALIGNANT MELANOMA

2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) is a glucose analogue which is inhibitor of glycolysis via its action on hexokinase. Cancer cells are more glycolysis-dependent than normal cells (Warburg effect), so 2DG was tested as a treatment for tumors.<br><br>Sorafenib is a small molecular multikinase inhibitor used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.<br><br>Malignant melanoma is very dangerous type of cancer, responsible for more than 75% of deaths caused by skin cancers.<br><br>In previous experiments a combination of 2DG with Sorafenib had been tested. But surprisingly was found that 2DG inhibits the effect of Sorafenib, so the level of survival of cells was stabilized.<br><br>The aim of this study was to understand how 2DG could enable melanoma cells to survive under conditions when the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is inhibited.<br><br>Malignant melanoma cell lines were treated with 2DG, Sorafenib and various inhibitors for testing different enzymes activity. Cell viability, cell cycle assay, Western blot and microscopy techniques were used for establishing the effects. Data from cell viability were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Turkey’s test.<br><br>Results show that 2DG in the conditions when Raf/MEK/ERK pathways is inhibited: increases AKT activity, strongly down-regulates p53, decreases ERK activity even more than Sorafenib alone. Adding an inhibitor of the adenylate cyclase to the combination of 2DG and Sorafenib increases the cell death to the same level as Sorafenib alone.However, inhibition of protein kinase A does not show the same effect. These results suggest that cell survival is mediated through PI3K/Akt or adenylate cyclase/cAMP/Epac/Akt pathways or both, further research is needed.<br><br>Study shows new possible targets of 2-deoxyglucose therapy, e.g. increasing the activity of AKT.

HEPARAN SULFATE GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN EXPRESSION AFFECTS NEPHRIN EXPRESSION AND EXOSOME RELEASE IN PODOCYTES
Ryan Ashley Browning
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Podocytes regulate glomerular ultrafiltration in the nephron. Many kidney diseases are caused by defective podocyte glomerular capillary wall interactions. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS) mediate podocyte-capillary wall interactions, the loss of HS causing changes in podocyte organization. Podocytes also interact with adjacent podocytes via a protein complex called a slit diaphragm. Changes in slit diaphragm organization also cause kidney disease. This study investigated whether changes in slit diaphragm organization occurred in animals (PEXTKO mice) whose podocytes lack HS. Tissue sections from control and PEXTKO mice were immunostained with antibodies against a slit diaphragm protein, nephrin. There was no difference in the pattern of immunostaining between the groups. Tissue sections from unilateral nephrectomized (UNX) control and PEXTKO mice were also stained and examined in the same manner. UNX causes renal hypertrophy and hyperfiltration. A net increase in nephrin expression was seen in UNX-PEXTKO mice compared to UNX-controls and in the non-UNX groups. Moreover, an increase in the presence of nephrin-positive exosomes (microparticles shed by podocytes) was seen in the proximal tubules of UNX-PEXTKO groups. The latter finding indicates that stressed podocytes in the UNX-PEXTKO animals may signal downstream to the proximal tubule system to evoke the compensatory functions of the tubuloglomerular feedback system in the nephron.

TURNING OFF THE TRANSPORTER SLC35F2
Yasmine Sapphire Zubi
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Genes often play a negative role in the biological behavior of cancer. Microarray analysis has suggested that SLC35F2 is highly-expressed in tumors of glial cells. The gene SLC35F2 has been attributed to the increased proliferation and migration of Non-small cell lung cancer and Osteosarcoma, which suggests it may play a role in other types of cancer, like Anaplastic Astrocytoma. Anaplastic Astrocytoma is a grade III tumor that originates astrocytes, which are star-shapes brain cells that physically support and nourish neurons. The objective of this experiment was to determine the role SLC35F2 plays in the proliferation and chemoresistant properties of Anaplastic Astrocytoma.<br><br> Anaplastic Asytrocytoma cells were propagated and maintained. Cells were treated with SLC35F2 and Negative Control siRNA. An MTT assay was performed on Days 0, 1, 2, and 3 to investigate the gene’s role on the metabolic rate of cells. A cell confluency test was performed to investigate the growth of the cells over time. Target cells were treated with 250 nM Paclitaxel and a Cytotoxicity assay was performed to investigate chemoresistance. Images were enhanced and analyzed with Image J. Standards were run for assays. <br><br> The data from MTT and Cell confluency analyses indicates that cells treated with SLC35F2 siRNA had lower metabolic rates when compared to cells treated with Negative Control siRNA. There was no statistical significance when comparing groups from the Cytotoxicity assay. This suggests that the gene SLC35F2 plays a role in the increased proliferation of Anaplastic Astrocytoma.

IN VITRO MACROMOLECULAR CROWDING AFFECTS CELLULAR BEHAVIOR
Karan Rajesh Naik
Centerville High School, Centerville, OH

The environment of cells is incredibly crowded in vivo with various macromolecules occupying large portion of available cell volume. However, this effect, known as molecular crowding, is not typically replicated effectively during in vitro studies. Although addition of inert macromolecular crowding agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or FicollTM can significantly increase and stabilize enzymatic reactions, its effects on mammalian cells has not been widely studied. In this study, I investigated the effect of macromolecular crowding on mammalian cells by cultivating cells in medium containing FicollTM. The effect of the FicollTM on cellular proliferation was studied using MTS assays, which demonstrated an increase in proliferation rate in multiple mammalian cell lines. Using flow cytometry, a clear increase in the number of cells in S phase of cell cycle, further evinced that the crowded environment was causing the cells to replicate faster. The effect of FicollTM medium on expression of biomarkers was also examined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The RT-PCR data demonstrated that FicollTM altered the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion. Interestingly, these alterations correlated with more pronounced cytoskeletal arrangement of b-actin, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Overall, these results indicate that macromolecular crowding, mimicked using FicollTM, promotes adhesion via cytoskeletal re-arrangement and increased cell proliferation. The outcome of this study could provide insights into controlling in vitro cellular behavior for a variety of applications ranging from basic cell biology studies to advanced cell-based therapies for treating diseases.

IDENTIFYING THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA
Phillip Yu
Shepton High School, Plano, TX

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease without any effective treatments. Abnormal clumps and mutations of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) have been found in patients with FTD. TDP-43 could be associated with a process known as inflammation. This project hypothesized that wild-type TDP-43 counteracts inflammation by inhibiting the NF-kB inflammatory pathway. It was proposed that loss of functional TDP-43 results in chronic inflammation and subsequently FTD. To test this, a luciferase assay was developed in which inflammation levels can be measured quantitatively in terms of light. Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene conjugated to an NF-kB promoter. When stimulated, the NF-kB pathway caused transcription of the light-emitting enzyme luciferase. Additionally, different cells were each transfected with different types of TDP-43 (wild-type and multiple mutants). Afterwards, luciferase activity of the cell lysates was measured in relative light units and normalized for transfection efficiency. Contrary to the hypothesis, wild-type TDP-43 did not have a significant effect on reducing inflammation. However, mutants resulted in a dramatic increase in NF-kB stimulation when compared to wild-type TDP-43 and pcDNA. Similar protein expression levels were confirmed using a western blot. It was therefore concluded that dysfunctional TDP-43 in FTD leads to a toxic gain-of-function and overactivation of the NF-kB pathway, which in turn causes chronic inflammation and eventually FTD. By targeting the NF-kB pathway and particularly TDP-43’s role in it, drugs can be developed for FTD, a disease that currently has no treatments.

REGULATION OF THE TURNOVER OF TAU
Sarah Lieou Sotack
Greece Athena High School, Rochester, NY

An estimated 5.4 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. One of the defining pathological hallmarks of the AD brain is the neurofibrillary tangle. Neurofibrillary tangles are primarily composed of paired helical filaments which are formed from hyperphosphorylated and/or truncated forms of the protein tau. There is increasing evidence that although the presence neurofibrillary tangles characterize the AD brain, these large insoluble protein aggregates are not the toxic species, but rather pathologically modified forms of tau that remain soluble compromise neuronal function. Therefore there is growing interest in defining the pathways that clear pathological forms of tau from the cell with the goal of developing pharmacological strategies to enhance clearance of the toxic forms of tau. Currently the factors that direct tau tau to be triaged to a specific pathway are unknown. In this project the possible role of proteasome or autophagy in clearing various forms of phosphorylated tau was investigated. Wild type tau as well as tau in which specific sites were pseudophosphorylated by converting a serine or threonine to a glutamatic acid, or phosphorylation was blocked by conversion of the serine or threonine to an alanine were expressed in cells. The cells were then treated with proteasome or autophagy inhibitors and samples collected and immunoblotted to determine the effects on tau levels. Currently the results are inconclusive given variability in the loading control (tubulin). Research on this topic is ongoing and reevaluation of methods, as well as further experimentation, will hopefully resolve these issues. Determining the pathways involved in the clearance of pathological tau will potentially contribute to the development of pharmacological interventions that may ameliorate disease progression in AD.

THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
Shirley See Yan Fang
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

The objective was to see how emotional and environmental stress affected the reproductive system. An environment similar to the conditions in the human hypothalamus was simulated using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron cell line (GN11 cells). Dexamethasone, an artificial stress-induced hormone was used as an emotional stress; hot and cold temperatures were used as an environmental stress. During experimentation, the calcium response stimulated by kisspeptin-10 (KP10) in immortalized GN11 cells with expressed kisspeptin receptors was measured using a microplate reader. <br><br>The controls were the GN11 cells treated with ethanol and cells at 37 degrees Celsius (human body temperature). The dose response of the intracellular KP10-mediated calcium signalling of GN11 was used to determine the impact of the stressors. The hypothesis was that there would be a decrease in KP10-stimulated calcium response in GN11 cells treated with dexamethasone and in GN11 cells both at 32 and 42 degrees Celsius compared to the controls.<br><br>The data showed that the effects of dexamethasone and lowering the temperature to 32 degrees Celsius caused a significant decrease to the calcium response in GN11 cells to KP10 treatment while raising the temperature to 42 degrees Celsius had no significant effect. A decrease in calcium response within the GnRH neurons indicates a decrease in the release of GnRH. This supports part of the hypothesis that under a stressful environment, the reproductive system is partially impaired by blunted kisspeptin-mediated calcium signaling.<br><br>

GENERATION OF INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (IPSCS) IN THE ABSENCE OF SOX2 AND CMYC
Mina Guo
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state was first accomplished by Takahashi and Yamanaka using retroviral vectors for expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors (TF). However, the reprogramming efficiency to produce this particular type of cell—Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) is very low, and the introduction of viral vectors leads to potential genome mutation. Numerous studies have reported alternative reprogramming methods to improve the efficiency of reprogramming, for example, the use of small molecule to enhance and replace TFs, but few are efficient. Here, I report a unique chemical combination: Vitamin C, E-616452, Resveratrol and Rapamycin, to generate monkey iPSCs without Sox2 and c-Myc. After four weeks of chemical treatment, 10-12 monkey iPSCs on average out of 50,000 cells were collected. They exhibited pluripotency surface and nuclear markers, silenced expression of exogenous genes, and an Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC)-like global gene expression profile. Since Resveratrol and Rapamycin are longevity-promoting compounds, the results show that somatic cell reprogramming and organismal lifespan share some common regulatory pathways, which suggests aging and longevity can be regulated by cellular reprogramming. Thus, this method provides a basis for developing safer and nonviral methods for reprogramming and discovering new regenerative medicine.

SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY APPROACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE DETECTOR
Jodie Leigh Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is one of the most commonly used spices for taste enhancement. However, it has been determined by researchers that all organs of the body contain glutamate receptors that MSG can damage. The main risk from MSG is damage done to the brain. Due to the health risks of MSG, there is a need for a low-cost readily available MSG detector for easy use by the public in situations where the presence of the substance in foods is uncertain.<br><br> <br><br>The purpose of this project was to address the need described above by developing an inexpensive genetically engineered biosensor that provides sensitive detection for MSG, and indicates its presence by a visual color change.<br><br> <br><br>To accomplish this purpose, the following goals were established for the project: (1) Identify a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can react when in contact with glutamate; (2) Identify a DNA promoter that will be responsive to glutamate; and (3) Design and construct a bacterial plasmid incorporating the glutamate-responsive promoter, inducing expression of the GFP reporter gene that will glow in the presence of MSG. <br><br> <br><br>Accomplishments towards these goals in Phase I included: (1) Designing the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) nucleotides; (2) Assembling and amplifying GFP genes using the nucleotides in a PCR machine; and (3) Assembling the GFP into a bacterial plasmid. <br><br> <br><br>Results from gel electrophoresis measurements showed that the project was ultimately successful in assembling the GFP genes. Cell colony UV illumination tests also proved that the bacteria with GFP glowed continuously.

CONTROLLING PROTEIN DEGRADATION IN E. COLI THROUGH PBAD PROMOTER ENGINEERING
Lindsay Marie Pietz
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

This research aims to separate production and growth phases of E. coli through arabinose inducible wildtype pBAD promoter to control protein degradation systems in order to further the field of metabolic engineering and control product yields. To explore this purpose an attack plasmid with wildtype pBAD promoter was constructed via Gibson assembly. First, double transformation was preformed by integrating 48S8 target plasmid with pBAD attack plasmid into E. coli pKS002. Then a plate reader analysis was run for 2 hours measuring the fluorescence and optical density of E. coli with pBAD and E. coli with trc before being induced with arabinose and IPTG. A second plate reader analysis was run for 2 hours. In conclusion, pBAD promoter had no significant inducibility capabilities on mCherry enzymes versus IPTG inducible trc promoter. When E. coli with pBAD were induced with nothing, fluorescent biomass enzymes were degraded no more quickly then when induced with arabinose or IPTG as observed by amount of fluorescence/OD before and after induction. The same trend also occurred for samples of E. coli with trc. One notable trend that emerged was no matter what E. coli with pBAD and E. coli with trc were induced with, more florescent biomass enzymes were degraded overall by E. coli with pBAD versus E. coli with trc. This suggests wildtype pBAD promoter is significantly more effective than trc promoter in decoupling the growth and production phases by degrading fluorescent biomass enzymes in a shorter time span than the trc promoter.

PURIFICATION OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY BY AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY
Nafisa Wara
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Tuberculosis affects all parts of the world, especially developing countries due to the high HIV infection rate; currently, there is no vaccination, and the current sputum culture diagnostic procedure is very invasive. The goal for this project has three main steps: to purify an antigen found to be associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb), one of the main causative agents of TB, in urine samples of active TB patients by affinity chromatography; to use the purified antigen for antibody purification from the antiserum of a rabbit raised against this antigen, and then to test the specificity of the antigen to the antibody with an immunological assay.<br><br>The gene that codes for the antigen of interest (HuAg6) was cloned into an expression vector, so before expressing and purifying HuAg6, the clone was first confirmed by double digestion with restriction enzymes. Then, a western blot was conducted to confirm the presence of the polyhistidine tag on the outside of the antigen when expressed by E. coli host cells. HuAg6 was over-expressed in BL-21 PlysS E. coli cells and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and an SDS-PAGE was run to confirm the antigen purification. The purified antigen was coupled to a sepharose resin and used to purify its specific antibody from the antiserum of a rabbit raised against this antigen. Finally, an immunological assay (ELISA) was used to see how low of a concentration of the antigen can be present for there to still be detection by the antibody.<br><br>The purified antibody specific to HuAg6 was found to detect the antigen at a 40,000x dilution, which confirms the antibody’s specificity. This antibody could be used in the development of a much less invasive, urine test-based diagnostic for patients infected with mtb.

IDENTIFY A NEW REGULATOR IN MITOSIS
Chi Zhang
High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Beijing, CHINA

Mitosis is a complicated and precisely regulated procedure, which ensures that the hereditary information carried by chromosomes can be equally passed from one cell to the two daughter cells, and therefore maintains the genome stability. Dysregulation of mitosis often results in apoptosis or uncontrolled cell proliferation, and lead to cancer. <br><br>Aiming to identify proteins that regulate mitosis procedure, I performed a high containing screening (HCS) with a siRNA library containing siRNAs targeting the selected proteins that have been previously reported being phosphorylated during mitosis. Here, I show that a protein was identified as a specific mitosis regulating factor. I found that the mitotic index (percentage of cells that are undergoing mitosis) was significantly increased when this protein was knocked down. By using a spinning-disk confocal microscopy, I showed that cells were blocked in prometaphase with unaligned chromosomes when this protein was depleted. In addition, the mitotic phase blocking induced by depletion of this protein promoted cell death. Interestingly, aberrant expression of this protein was observed in many types of human cancers. Together, these results suggest that I have identified a key regulator in mitosis progression, and the regulator might become a valuable molecular target for tumor therapy in future.

REMOVAL OF C-IAP2 E3 ACTIVITY ALTERS REGULATORY T-CELL FUNCTION AND DIFFERENTIATION
Neelanjan Lakshman
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

The protein c-IAP2 is an upstream regulator in the transcription factor NF-kB, one of the three transcription factors associated with human cancer. Alteration of this protein has become a hot topic for cancer therapy. The purpose of this experiment was to clarify the importance of c-IAP2 ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity in regulatory T cell function and differentiation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) from wild type mice were compared those from mice lacking E3 activity in c-IAP2. The hypothesis was that there would be a difference in both the function and differentiation of Tregs. The methods used to conduct this study included cell staining, counting, multicolor flow cytometry, and real time PCR. The mice lacking c-IAP2 E3 activity showed an increased production of thymic derived Tregs, and a stable production of inducible Tregs compared to the wild type. In both types of Tregs, production of the immunosuppressant CTLA4 was decreased, indicating lower functionality. Tregs also decayed at a slower rate in the c-IAP2 E3 inactive mice. Preliminary data indicated an increased production of inhibitory cytokines in the c-IAP2 E3 inactive mice. The conclusion was that the function and differentiation of Tregs was definitely altered, as hypothesized. Most of the data suggests decreased functionality of the Tregs, however some preliminary data suggests that the Tregs may have compensated lack of CTLA4 production through other means of immune suppression such as increased release of inhibitory cytokines. Regardless, this data indicates that c-IAP2 E3 activity plays an important role in regulatory T cell development.

THE EFFECT OF TRICHOSTATIN A ON CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS IN A549 LUNG CARCINOMA
Felicia Aileng Phan
Niles Township West High School, Skokie, IL

Trichostatin A’s (TSA’s) epigenetic impact as a known histone deacetylase inhibitor, also shows cellular influences including altering the cell cycle and causing apoptosis, making it a good candidate for cancer treatment. The cellular mechanism that causes these events is unknown. Transgenic mice treated with TSA have increased cytoplasmic calcium levels. TSA should therefore do the same in A549 lung cancer cells. Intracellular shifts in calcium levels, which have been shown to cause apoptosis, suggest a mechanism for this cancer therapy.<br><br>Confluent cells grown in 8 chamber slides, were treated with Calcium Green-1 for 30 minutes. Chamber walls were removed and one of six different treatments – DMSO, ionomycin, 125nM TSA, 250nM TSA, 500nM TSA, and 1000nM TSA, was added to the slide. Pictures using a fluorescent microscope were taken every thirty seconds for 3 minutes; and were subsequently quantified using Image J.<br><br>Calcium fluorescence increased in A549 cells as TSA concentration increased. This supports the hypothesis that similar alteration of calcium levels by TSA seen in mice occurs in cancer cells. The increase in calcium levels in A549 cells caused by TSA may be the first step in its orchestration of apoptosis in these cells, and suggests an epigenetic connection as it is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor. Further investigation testing treated cells for an increase in Caspase 3, would provide more insight into the specific signaling pathway used by TSA. Identifying which cytoplasmic proteins are directly impacted by deacetylase inhibition may provide further insight into the calcium homeostatic imbalance seen in this study.

DISCOVERING A METABOLIC WEAKNESS IN MELANOMA THROUGH TARGETED GENE INHIBITION
Hannah Constance Wastyk
Palmyra Area High School, Palmyra, PA

An effective cancer treatment must prove lethal to cancer cells, but leave normal cells relatively unaffected. Current treatment options can be effective in killing cancer cells, but their non-specificity leads to serious side effects. In order to explore different treatment options, I inhibited a novel target associated with amino acid metabolism, ALDH18A1. My research has indicated that siALDH18A1 is effective in inhibiting translation of the ALDH18A1 gene, and using colorimetric assay methods, the siRNA has been shown to significantly decrease cell viability and proliferation in cancer cells, but not fibroblasts. Western blot experimentation does not point to any common methods of decreased cell viability illustrated in prior literature, leading to explorations in amino acid supplementation. The proline and ornithine supplementation of siALDH18A1-transfected cells proved to have a significant effect on the recovery of cancer cells and therefore, play a crucial role in cancer cell viability. The inhibition of ALDH18A1 gene expression is a novel therapeutic treatment option that could exploit a major metabolic weakness in melanoma and provide a safer cancer treatment by minimizing the adverse effects on patients while maximizing the decrease in viability of cancer cells. This is the first research of its kind to fully explore the effects of ALDH18A1 gene inhibition and identify amino acid synthesis pathways as a mechanism of its decreased cell viability.

ENHANCING MATURATION OF HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL-DERIVED CARDIOMYOCYTES BY TRIIODOTHYRONINE TREATMENT AND NANOPATTERNED SUBSTRATES
Isaac Stephen Harper
Cedarcrest High School, Duvall, WA

Each year, approximately 600,000 people die of heart disease in the United States. Recent advances in stem cell research have introduced new options for scientists to investigate potential treatments for regenerating damaged cardiac tissue and avoiding high-risk and high-cost treatments such as open heart surgery or cardiac transplantation. The purpose of this study is to test the maturation effects of the thyroid hormone Triiodothyronine (T3) on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as well as the physiological impact of nanopatterned substrates on cell length and orientation. If hiPSC-CMs can be matured effectively in a laboratory setting, it would open the door to future studies where hiPSC-CMs could be implanted in damaged heart tissue and their regenerative properties could be assessed. The findings of the current study are two-fold: 1) hiPSC-CMs treated with T3 yielded larger cell sizes and better myofibrillar length, and 2) hiPSC-CMs cultured on nanopatterned substrates had greater length-to-width ratios and improved cell orientation. As a result, the null hypothesis can be rejected and these findings may be useful in further cardiac regeneration studies.

EPIGENETIC DIFFERENCES IN FETAL MURINE LIVER ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE OF METABOLIC DISEASE
Caroline Knight Snowden
Ponte Vedra High School, Ponte Vedra, FL

Metabolic disorders are an expanding global health problem affecting millions worldwide. The reasons for this expansion are unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that epigenetics plays a role. Past studies have shown that maternal over- or under-nutrition during gestation can increase the likelihood of obesity and insulin resistance in future generations. This study examined the epigenetic differences in 18 fetal mice, nine with fathers undernourished in utero and nine with genetically identical control fathers, with the hypothesis that fetal under-nutrition would affect epigenetic markers one generation later. <br><br> Epigenome-wide chromatin state mapping and diverse statistical analyses including the edgeR algorithm, DAVID gene set analysis, hierarchical clustering and the DiffCalc algorithm (Mikkelson et al, 2010) revealed several gene sets that had significantly less H3K4me1 enrichment (a mark of enhancers) in experimental versus control samples. These gene sets include a PI3 kinase pathway-related gene set, suggesting the possibility of PI3k pathway involvement in transgenerational inheritance of metabolic disorders. However, there were no significant transcriptional differences on the RNA microarray analysis in PI3k-related genes, nor were there corresponding differences in H3K27ac and H3K36me3 enrichment, both typical markers of transcription. These results suggest the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of a silent epigenetic predisposition for metabolic disorders.

EFFECT OF AKT 1/2 INHIBITOR AND EX-527 ON TRANSCRIPTION OF BIM AND CATALSE IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Viktor Christian Polites
Central York High School, York, PA

The forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors regulate a variety of cell functions through gene expression. FOXO proteins can induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, arrest the cell cycle, detoxify reactive oxygen species, and repair DNA damage through it’s transcriptional activity.<br><br> The goal of this study was to determine what effects an Akt1/2 Kinase Inhibitor and a SIRT1 Inhibitor (Ex-527) used alone and in combination would have on expression of Bim and Catalase mRNA and on cell death in a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). Research shows that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibits FOXO’s transcriptional activity. On this principle, research teams have shown that inhibition of FOXO phosphorylation in cancerous cell lines and in cancer-infected mice leads to increased apoptosis and expression of FOXO target genes. Evidence suggests that FOXO’s acetylation signature determines which genes it transcribes. Studies have shown that the deacetylation by SIRT1 enhances FOXO-induced transcription of catalase while inhibiting FOXO-induced transcription of Bim. <br><br> The hypotheses were that treatment of MCF-7 with Akt1/2 inhibitor would increase transcription of the FOXO target genes Bim and catalase and increase cell death, treatment of MCF-7 with Ex-527 would have little effect on gene expression and cell death, and treatment of MCF-7 with the drugs combined would increase transcription of Bim but not catalase and cause the most cell death. Treating with the Akt 1/2 inhibitor, Ex-527, and the drugs in combination caused decreases in transcription of bim and catalase and had little effect on cell death.

HYPERGLYCEMIA AND HIV: A CORRELATION- HYPERGLYCEMIA INCREASES HIV ENTRY IN T CELLS VIA ROS GENERATION
Aakash Viren Jhaveri
The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, NY

Investigators have demonstrated that HIV therapy can facilitate the progression of hyperglycemia and diabetes. Mechanisms proposed to explain the HIV entry phenomena reference the CXCR4 receptor. In this study, Jurkat T cells (JKT) were treated with 5 to 30mM glucose, and infected with HIV. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were used to test our hypothesis in non-immortalized cells. Expression of CXCR4 and its transcriptional regulator HIF-1α were determined using Western Blotting and QRT-PCR assays. The expression of CXCR4 was eliminated using siRNA to evaluate if increased expression of CXCR4 was responsible for increased HIV entry. Intracellular ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) generation was determined by analyzing the intensity of the intracellular fluoroprobe 2,7 dichlorofluorescin (DCFH). Immunohistochemistry assays were performed to display the effects of high glucose (HG) on the expression of CXCR4. JKT and PBMC were infected with HIV. HIV entry was increased after treatment with HG. ROS generation increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with HG. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide, a known ROS, confirmed that the increase in CXCR4 and HIF-1α expression was due to increased ROS. Additionally, the suppression of oxidative stress induced by HG led to a decrease in CXCR4 expression. QRT-PCR analyses delineated that our results were a result of increased expression of CXCR4 and subsequently increased HIV entry. Our study revealed that hyperglycemia increases HIV entry in immune cells, potentially furthering the progression of HIV. Clinicians must be made aware of these findings to monitor blood glucose levels and prevent further exacerbation of this condition.

DEPLETION OF CIRCULATORY ST6GAL-1 ALTERS B-CELL DEVELOPMENT
Yankang Yang
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

Proper development of white blood cells from Hematopoietic Stem Cells is vital in immune system-initiated responses to pathogens. Signals governing development are passed onto cells from their surroundings by cell surface glycans. ST6Gal-1, which plays an important role in hematopoiesis and immunity, is an enzyme that completes cell surface glycan chains by attaching sialic acid to the ends. Expression of ST6Gal-1 is regulated by 6 known promoter regions. The P1 Promoter, knocked-out in the dP1 animal, codes for production of circulatory ST6Gal-1, which is generated only by the liver. To study the overarching role of circulatory ST6Gal-1 in immune cell development, a comparison of the normal (WT) and dP1 was preformed starting with B-Cells, which mature into crucial antibody producing leukocytes in the spleen.<br><br> <br><br>B-Cell subpopulation sizes at different maturation stages were measured using flow-cytometry. dP1 Spleens had half the amount of first responding marginal zone B-Cells, but twice the amount of immature B cells. An RT-qPCR analysis found that dP1 B-Cells expressed 60.4% less intrinsic ST6Gal-1. Taken together, the data indicates that depleting circulatory ST6Gal-1 causes misregulation of B-Cell development on both extrinsic and intrinsic levels. Thus, circulatory ST6Gal-1 is vital to immune responses to pathogens as it allows B-Cells to develop properly. Another qPCR showed that dP1 T-Cells also lose some ability to produce intrinsic ST6Gal-1, expanding the importance of circulatory ST6Gal-1 to other immune cells' development as well. Arrested B-Cell development hampers initial immune responses, and is a symptom seen in leukemia, arthritis, and asthma. This research is acts as an important spring board for clinically applicable research of circulatory ST6Gal-1.

ADHESION RECEPTOR DYSTROGLYCAN AS A REGULATOR OF OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITOR CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Amelia Susan Ricketts
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

Much of the brain and spinal cord is composed of long neuronal connections called axons that are coated with myelin, a specialized fatty membrane that is essential for fast and synchronized nerve transmission. Destruction or dysfunction of these critical myelinated relay zones, whether caused by congenital or degenerative disease and/or substance abuse, poses permanent harm to the health of the nervous system, as no treatments that stimulate myelin repair currently exist. Thus, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of myelination in order to understand and combat myelin-based diseases.<br><br>Oligodendrocytes are myelinating cells in the central nervous system. The transmembrane adhesion receptor dystroglycan is integral to proper oligodendrocyte development. Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes can cleave dystroglycan, however, the consequence of this cleavage is uknown. <br><br>This study investigates the role of dystroglycan cleavage during oligodendrocyte differentiation by transfecting a construct designed to mimic the cellular portion of cleaved dystroglycan into developing oligodendrocytes. The immature oligodendrocytes were allowed to differentiate and were analyzed for the presence of differentiation stage-specific proteins using fluorescent immunocytochemistry and cell lysis followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The results indicate that increasing the levels of cleaved dystroglycan enhances the rate of oligodendrocyte differentiation, suggesting that modulating dystroglycan cleavage may be a future target of drug therapy for myelin-based diseases. Such treatments would directly benefit society by improving patient quality of life.

MODIFICATION OF HUMAN MESENCHYMAL CELLS’ STEM CAPACITY: THE RELATION BETWEEN BETA-CATENIN QUANTITY AND CELL PROLIFERATION AND SPECIALIZATION - PHASE II
Laura Rudella Tonidandel
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Stem cells are extensively studied nowadays due to the potential to use technologies derived from stem cells research in treatment of human diseases ., In previous analyses, I verified that mesenchymal stem cells’ (MSC) samples from different donors, although treated on equal<br><br>conditions, were proliferating on different rates in vitro. Thus, I verified that the body mass index of the female cells’ donors showed a direct proportion with the number of MSC per ml fat and a reverse proportion with cellular multiplication rate in vitro. To understand these observations, I made a new investigation to study a possible relation of beta-catenin protein and the MSC proliferation and specialization, acutely related events in stem cells. First, I did pre-<br><br>tests to establish the best experimental conditions. Then, I analyzed the relation of beta-catenin and cell proliferation using flow cytometry technique with cells previously marked by CFSE, a cell’s proliferation indicator. Finally, I induced cell differentiation in vitro with some reagents by which I analyzed cells’ specialization. Regarding to proliferation, I verified a reverse proportion between Beta-catenin positivity and cell proliferation. When comparing cells’ specialization with beta-catenin positivity, I also detected a reverse proportion. Therefore, I concluded that the quantity of beta-catenin in MSC modifies the cell “stem capacity” (undifferentiation, self-renewal, and big proliferative potential). The deep knowledge of the molecular process by which the cells acquire their cell-specific fate is essential for the creation and revolution of cell-based therapies for human diseases, developing safer, accurate and customized treatments according to each patient needs.

FINDING THE ROLE OF AGGREGATION, HYPERPHOSPHORYLATION, AND MUTATION OF TAU PROTEIN IN CAUSING ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE USING C. ELEGANS WORMS
Disha Dasgupta
Olathe North High School, Olathe, KS

This project investigated whether abnormal tau protein encoding genes cause Alzheimer’s disease, which affects over 27 million people worldwide. Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) made of tau, have been found in the autopsies of Alzheimer’s patients’ brains. This led the researcher to Hypothesis 1 – Aggregation of the tau protein causes neural dysfunctions. Phosphorylation helps the tau protein to stabilize microtubules that are responsible for axonal transport between neurons. This led the researcher to Hypothesis 2 – Hyperphosphorylation of the tau encoding gene (7Phos) causes neural dysfunctions. The P301L mutation is linked to Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-17) and the 3PO mutation causes the tau protein to aggregate faster. This led the researcher to Hypothesis 3 – Mutations of tau encoding genes cause neural dysfunctions. C. elegans worms injected with tau-encoding genes infused with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) were used for the experiments. Behavioral assays were used to investigate dysfunctions of the nervous system characterized in Alzheimer’s disease. GFP microscopy was used to determine the aggregation of the tau protein and the presence of the hyperphosphorylated and mutated tau proteins in C. elegans. Results from 313 trials, using 63 C. elegans worms, supported all three hypotheses that the aggregation, hyperphosphorylation, and mutations of tau protein cause neural dysfunctions. Though previous studies postulated the role of the tau protein in causing Alzheimer’s disease, this study investigated the specific mutations of the tau encoding gene that cause neural dysfunctions. Findings from this study could lead to a cure for Alzheimer’s disease.

INVESTIGATING MICRORNA-MEDIATED REGULATION OF CLASS SPECIFIC DENDRITE MORPHOGENESIS
Suhas Gondi
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that function as critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression through silencing mechanisms. MiRNA-mediated gene regulation has been implicated across numerous species with roles in diverse biological processes including embryonic development, cancer, and neuronal morphogenesis, the developmental process by which neurons reach distinctive morphologies. Recent studies in Drosophila have implicated miRNAs in neuronal development and specification. Despite these advances, the precise role of miRNAs in neuronal morphogenesis remains largely unknown. <br><br> The focus of the current study is to systematically determine the putative functional roles of specific miRNAs implicated in differential dendrite development by use of novel miRNA-sponge transgenic loss-of-function (LOF) analyses coupled with complementary gain-of-function (GOF) studies. Analyses of evolutionarily conserved K box miRNAs are reported here. The GAL4-UAS expression system was used to drive suppression and ectopic overexpression of miRNAs in class I and class IV dendritic arborization neurons in Drosophila. Progeny of genetic crosses were live-imaged using confocal microscopy and images of single neurons were quantified with respect to several measures of dendritic complexity. Statistical analysis of LOF studies revealed significant decreases in dendritic complexity, suggesting that K box miRNAs inhibit the expression of genes that restrict dendritic complexity. Results of GOF studies also support the conclusion that these miRNAs function in promoting dendritic complexity in several distinct types of neurons. These findings elucidate the functional significance of miRNAs in regulating dendrite morphogenesis and have applications in miRNA therapy.

THE EFFECT OF GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR ON CLASSICAL AND ALTERNATIVE ACTIVATION OF BONE MARROW DERIVED MACROPHAGES
Mackenzie Stephanie-Ann Zierau
Mercy High School, Farmington Hills, MI

Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine necessary for the growth and development of myeloid immune cells. Within the immune system, two types of macrophages exist. M1 macrophages kill infectious agents; known as classical activation. M2 macrophages repair the site where the M1 macrophages did their job; known as alternative activation. The purpose of this experiment was to understand the effects of GM-CSF on the activation of mature macrophages. Most research on GM-CSF focuses on the development of ‘immature’ macrophages from the bone marrow. At present there is little research on how GM-CSF effects mature macrophages. Macrophages were studied by pairing GM-CSF with various stimuli and comparing the immune responses of mature cells. M1 data indicated GM-CSF alone didn’t induce M1 gene expression. GM-CSF inhibited the inflammatory immune responses of M1 macrophages. As the dosage of GM-CSF was increased, M1 cell responses were further restrained. M2 data indicated GM-CSF alone induced M2 gene expression. GM-CSF combined with an M2 stimulus, IL-4, promoted the activation of M2 macrophages. As the dosage of GM-CSF increased in culture, M2 cell responses increased. Previous research suggests that GM-CSF may be used for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Results in this experiment indicated that GM-CSF promotes M2 responses; therefore GM-CSF may promote cancer growth, as M2 macrophages are thought to play a role in the progression of solid tumors. GM-CSF inhibited M1 responses, suggesting that GM-CSF may be helpful in the treatment of diseases in which M1 macrophages destroy tissues, such as arthritis.

INTERCELLULAR SIGNALING MOLECULES INVOLVED IN THE HUMAN NEUTROPHILIC RESPONSE TO FUNGAL BETA-GLUCAN
Wei Li
East Greenwich High School, East Greenwich, RI

The overall goal is to determine the seminal events in human neutrophil response to Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is the fourth leading cause of nosocomial infectious disease. Beta- Glucan, a polysaccharide component of the cell wall of C. albicans, is a pathogen associated molecular pattern. It is recognized by the neutrophil surface receptor, Complement Receptor 3 (CR3). Previous studies in the lab have shown that in the presence of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and Beta-glucan together, neutrophils form homotypic aggregates, hypothesized to be a part of the neutrophil response to C. albicans. Aggregation did not take place when cells were exposed to fibronectin or glucan alone. My project was done to better understand how this aggregation occurs. Inhibitors of cellular signaling molecules were used and showed that ERK, PI3K, and PKC are essential to aggregate formation. GSK3Beta showed a partial affect on cluster formation. My project involved quantifying the effect of the inhibitors. Working with a graduate student, I developed a computer algorithm by maneuvering MATLAB script. This program allowed me to quantify the aggregate formation by size and frequency. Analysis was based on microscope images I took of various treatment conditions. Further investigation will continue to determine the signal transduction pathways and the functional response of the human neutrophil to fungal pathogens.

N-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF GP36 PROTEIN OF BACTERIOPHAGE LKA1 MODULATES ITS INHIBITORY EFFECT ON HOST RNAP
Matvey Vladimirovich Kolesnik
"Intellectual" Boarding School, Moscow, RUSSIA

Bacteriophage T7 infecting Escherichia coli is a founding member of a large clade of podoviruses encoding a single-subunit RNA polymerase. Phages of this family rely on host RNA polymerase for early viral gene transcription. Viral RNA polymerase transcribes non-early viral genes. T7 and its close relatives encode an inhibitor of host RNA polymerase, the gp2 protein. Gp2 is essential for phage development and ensures that host RNA polymerase does not interfere with viral RNA polymerase transcription at late stages of infection. <br><br> KMV phage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified. It was demonstrated that some of these proteins are functionally identical to T7 gp2 in vivo and in vitro. Ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LKA1 gp2-like protein to inhibit RNA polymerase is modulated by N-terminal domain, which is absent from T7 phage homolog.Recently, host RNA polymerase inhibitors encoded by a subset of T7 clade phages related to  <br><br> The N-terminal extension of gp36 contains four cysteine residues that may bind a metal ion forming a Zn-finger-like structure. We have created shorter version of gp36 without cysteine-containing region that became effective RNA polymerase inhibitor, like the gp2 protein. We therefore conclude that the N-terminal extension of bacteriophage LKA1 gp36 protein negatively modulates its ability to inhibit P. aeruginosa RNAP. We speculate that this modulation may be dependent on gp36 ability to chelate metal ions.

MIRNA AND CANCER, PHASE II: CONSTRUCTING A BIDIRECTIONAL CASSETTE TO IDENTIFY MIRNA REGULATORS
Lawrence Zhang
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

Abnormal miRNA levels can lead to the development of cancers. Consequently, miRNA therapy has been developed to offset the effects of abnormal miRNA levels in cancer cells. However, the current model of this therapy cannot regulate the exact amount of miRNA activity within cells. Thus, the purpose of this project is to construct a cassette that identifies unique gene regulators of certain miRNAs to better regulate miRNA activity.<br><br> <br><br>The cassette is comprised of a bidirectional promoter and two different luciferase genes: eYFP and mCherry. Attached to the 3’UTR of the mCherry are two miRNA let–7 binding sites. This allows let–7 miRNAs to attach to these sites and suppress mCherry expression. So, cells transfected with this cassette should exhibit visibly lower levels of mCherry in comparison to eYFP.<br><br> <br><br>After the cassette was constructed, restriction endonuclease digestion verified the location of the components of the cassette and sequencing confirmed the validity of the let–7 binding sites. Fluorescence microscopy results indicate, as expected, dramatic lower mCherry activity compared to eYFP activity.<br><br> <br><br>This cassette can then be used to identify miRNA regulators. Random mutations will be introduced into cells with this cassette. Any mutations to miRNA regulators will cause abnormal miRNA levels, resulting in varying mCherry activity. Cells with these mutations can then be isolated with florescence activated cell sorting. Inverse PCR can then be performed to identify these mutated miRNA regulators. By identifying these regulators, miRNA therapy will be more accurate, serving as a better and safer treatment of cancers.

THE EFFECTS OF MICROTUBULE DYNAMICS ON GLIOMA CELL MOTILITY
Lucas Ray Kramer

Background: Although the U251 Glioma cell line has been a common choice for research in cell migration, It’s microtubule dynamics have not been previously quantified.<br><br>Microtubules in neurons have been found to accumulate in a cell length-dependant manner, yielding a linear correlation between process length and the number of microtubule comets present in the process. U251 cells have many morphological similarities to neurons, suggesting similarities in the microtubule dynamics. <br><br>Procedure: U251 cells were transfected with EB1-GFP to fluorescently label the microtubule ends and examined with an epifluorescence microscope. Videos were collected of the microtubules and the videos were analyzed with kymographs and a microtubule counting program. <br><br>Results: The average microtubule velocity was measured experimentally, although it has a very high variability. <br><br> The Cell Length Dependent Model (CLDM) was also experimentally tested, and the expected results were achieved. <br><br>Conclusion: Measurements on the cells yielded preliminary results about microtubule velocity. <br><br>As a linear trend has been observed between the number of microtubules in a process and process length, the CLDM has been confirmed in this particular cell line.

AN EMPIRICAL METHOD FOR HAPLOTYPE PHASING USING NANODROPLETS IN DIGITAL EMULSION PCR
Catherine Wong
Morristown High School, Morristown, NJ

Determination of genetic haplotypes, the specific combination of alleles present on any one chromosome within a homologous pair, is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool in determining the influence of genetic factors on phenotype. Although haplotypes have broad applications ranging from determining complex disease susceptibility to evolutionary genetics, standard genotyping approaches cannot directly determine haplotype phase. Using a novel application of droplet digital PCR, a high-throughput emulsion PCR technique that confines DNA molecules within discrete nanodroplets, this project successfully developed a method that allows for empirically determining the haplotype phase, or relative placement of genetic variations within a homologous chromosome pair, between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs. Using pairs of allele-specific probes, it was possible to infer haplotype phase based on the statistical independence of probe detection, which were shown to correlate directly with the presence of SNPs on the same or separate chromosomes. The method developed feasibly and accurately determined haplotype phase for SNPs ranging from 5 to 50kb apart, with 90.32% haplotyping accuracy even in a sample of 31 longer-range SNP pairs separated by approximately 20 to 50 kb. Results also allowed estimation of DNA sample integrity based on ratios of droplets singly and doubly positive for the assigned probes. Future study could determine the limits of this haplotyping method through use of additional DNA samples and longer-range SNPs; nevertheless, current results support ddPCR as an effective method for individual haplotyping.

BONDAR'S: IS IT CRYPTIC OR NOT?
Laurie Jean Scott
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

: Is Paraleyrodes bondari a cryptic species complex? This research was conducted at the United States Department of Agriculture Horticulture Lab in Ft. Pierce, Florida. First primers that would amplify the 12S region of mtDNA were identified, and used to analyze samples that were morphologically identified as Bondar’s Nesting Fly’s. The DNA was sequenced and analyzed using Geneious. It is apparent from the 12S region of mtDNA that CLM 704 which was identified as P. bondari is genetically very different from CLM 741 which was also identified as P. bondari. By looking at the phylogenetic tree, it is evident that CLM 741 and another collection of P. bondari, CLM 759, are the same species at 100% similarity and CLM 704 is more closely related to Trialeurodes varialilis; however the confidence level is very low at 66%. Genetic data shows that these taxa that were morphologically identified as Paraleyrodes bondari are clearly two different species and therefore cryptic species.

AN INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECTS OF ELECTROPHORESIS AND SODIUM DODECYL SULFATE ON THE SEMI-PERMEABLE PROPERTIES OF THE CELL MEMBRANE
Jinsong Yan
Cleveland High School, Portland, OR

Cell lysis is a common practice involving the dissolution of the plasma membrane through the disruption of hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions in the lipid bilayer, leading to the release of cellular contents. This process is necessary as sizable particles are unable/ineffectively diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer. This investigation primarily aims to test the effects of a nonchemical variable: electricity (200V), as an alternate form of cellular membrane stimulation/disruption, to increase permeability. This experiment is the first step in a series of investigations exploring the concept of electroporation in the reverse form to extract compounds from within the cellular cytoplasm. The effects of an electrical current are compared to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a strong detergent chemical traditionally utilized in the process of cell lysis. Samples of beet root cells were exposed to electrical currents and concentrated solution of SDS in addition to 1X concentration TAE electrophoresis buffer and deionized water controls. The corresponding release of pigment is measured through optical spectrometry and plotted at 422nm. Data shows significant absorbency increase between each treatment (p-value <0.05). The research hypothesis was rejected as data shows sodium dodecyl sulfate (4%) yielded the highest absorbency (0.1833Abs) by average. The results leads to the conclusion: electricity increases release of pigment compared to the controls (distilled water and 1X TAE treatments), but does not surpass the effectiveness of SDS. The experiment demonstrates a possibility for reverse-electroporation, but would require further research and optimization for scientific/commercial use.

MUTAGENIC EFFECTS OF INORGANIC PARTICULATE MATTER ON RAJI AND HEPG2 CELL LINES EXPOSED TO ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
Michael Xiao
Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy, Lindon, UT

Epidemiological studies have correlated exposure to ultraviolet-irradiated particulate matter with cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant lung diseases. This study investigated the DNA damage induced by two major inorganic particulate matter compounds found in diesel exhaust, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate on Burkitt’s lymphoma (Raji) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. There was a dose-dependent positive correlation of accumulated DNA damage in concentrations of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate (25 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, 200 µg/ml, 400 µg/ml) with ultraviolet exposure (250 J/m2, 400 J/m2, 600 J/m2, 850 J/m2), as measured by the Comet Assay in both cell lines. There was a significant difference between the treated ammonium nitrate samples and negative control samples in Raji and HepG2 (p < 0.001). Apoptosis was shown in Raji and HepG2 cells when exposed to high concentrations of ammonium nitrate (200 µg/ml, 400 µg/ml) for 1 hour in samples without ultraviolet exposure. Annexin V Flow Cytometry confirmed the results shown by the Comet Assay; ultraviolet exposure diminished apoptosis in ammonium nitrate-induced DNA damage in both Raji and HepG2. These results indicate that the inorganic particulate compound, ammonium nitrate, induced DNA strand breaks at all concentrations and apoptosis at high concentrations in Raji and HepG2 cells, with ultraviolet radiation preventing apoptosis at high concentrations. This is hypothesized to be due to the inhibition of an essential cellular mechanism, possibly involving the activation of p53. Further studies are necessary to characterize the roles of apoptosis inhibition in DNA damage caused by inorganic particulate matter.

GENETIC CAUSES OF PARTIAL ALBINISM IN SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALES (EUBALAENA AUSTRALIS)
Guy Darrell Eroh
Academy for Math, Engineering and Science, Salt Lake City, UT

The long-range goal of this project is to find the genetic basis for partial albinism in southern right whales. Interest in this project was stimulated by a passion for this endangered species and the observation of an unusual white skin phenotype in a sub-population of the whales. I hypothesized that the white color was due to a decreased number of melanocytes in the skin. To test this hypothesis, partial albino and normal control whales were evaluated. Physical characteristics of each whale were correlated with microscopic features, and an X-linked pattern of inheritance was observed. Melanocytes were identified histologically with Fontana-Mason silver stain and counted using a standard semi-quantitative method. Melanosome size was directly measured from transmission electron micrographs. DNA and RNA were extracted from the skin for future experiments. Analysis of the data confirmed the hypothesis that normal skin contained more melanocytes than partial albino skin, but also revealed that partial albino melanosomes were smaller. Taken together, these data suggest that the function of the causative gene includes pigment production, as well as melanocyte migration or survival. Since the causative gene is likely to reside on the X-chromosome, the bovine X-chromosome (the most closely-related species with whole-genome sequencing available) was carefully examined for gene candidates. Future experiments will be performed to narrow the list further and ultimately identify the causative gene. Identification of a pigmentation and melanocyte survival/migration gene in whales may have applications to human disease and enhance awareness of the value of understanding and preserving endangered marine creatures.

WHAT ARE MECHANIMS UNDERLYING NICOTINE INDUCED NEUTROPHIL APOPTOSIS?
Jay Kumar
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Apoptosis is a mechanism of clearance of unwanted cells. However, untimely loss of neutrophils can promote infection, inflammation, and diseases such as periodontal disease. It was hypothesized that nicotine exerted its effects by binding to its cognate a4-nicotinic receptor and would induce apoptosis by activating p38 MAPK cascade. Nicotine 3 mM accelerated neutrophil apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 cleavage in a time dependent manner compared to control cells in an ERK and p38 MAPK dependent manner. Nicotine exerted its apoptotic effects by binding to a4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a4 AChR) as the blockade of this receptor with its antagonist Dihydro-b-erythroidine hydrobromide (DbE) blocked nicotine stimulated ERK, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, it was demonstrated that nicotine induced FasL expression, FasL secretion, enhanced Mst-1 cleavage, and promoted phosphorylation of Ser14Histone2B. Blockade of p38 and ERK with SB203580 and PD98059 respectively inhibited nicotine induced FasL expression, Mst-1 cleavage, and pSer14Histone2B. Furthermore, treatment of neutrophils with FasL antibody prevented nicotine induced caspase-3 cleavage and Mst-1 activation. These results suggest that nicotine induces the extrinsic apoptotic cascade in neutrophils by induction of FasL/Fas pathway. FasL antibodies could serve a therapeutic role to prevent neutrophil apoptosis in periodontal disease in smokers.

SHAKE HANDS OVER CURES, NOT PD - DIFFERENTIATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS DERIVED FROM HUMAN-INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
Eunice Linh You
Laval Liberty High School, Laval, CANADA

As Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the localized degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons, stem cell therapy is particularly promising. However, while early clinical trials eliminated motor deficits in many patients, others suffered from dyskinesia. It is hypothesized that the outcome inconsistencies are due to the transplantation of immunogenic and inhomogeneous neural grafts at insufficient amounts. Therefore, this project aims to characterize the DA neurons differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSc) following an optimized protocol.<br><br>Skin-derived precursors extracted from a human biopsy were proliferated and differentiated into DA neurons. Unlike the traditional protocol, the differentiation was delayed and different growth factors added to allow continuance of cell division, resulting in a greater number of DA neurons generated and the rise of important cell types. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was then designed to neuronal and DA markers. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) also detected neural marker expression. After a month of differentiation, neuron-rich patches characteristic of DA neurons were formed. The greater number of generated neurons and presence of important cell types were confirmed. Results from the RT-PCR and ICC revealed the expression of DA markers in the DA line. <br><br>Although future work includes performing tests such as HPLC to measure level of dopamine secreted and in vivo studies with Parkinsonian rats, the results prove the protocol optimizes the neurons generated. In addition to enabling autologous transplantation for PD, this research is relevant pharmaceutical biotechnology and can be used to advance our knowledge on the mechanisms governing DA differentiation.

COCAINE HIJACKS SIGMA-1 RECEPTORS FROM THE ER INTO THE NUCLEUS TO REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION BY INTERACTING WITH LAMIN-ASSOCIATED EMERIN
Natasha Dawn Ceballos
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident non-opioid receptor that is expressed in the nervous system and can regulate cellular differentiation, neuroplasticity, and neuroprotection and has been known to be affected by cocaine. Nuclear lamins in the nucleus are essential for the nuclear envelope assembly, DNA synthesis, and gene transcription. I tested the hypothesis that cocaine would increase the amount of Sig-1Rs moving to the nuclear membrane from the ER, when compared to cells not treated with cocaine. Confocal` microscopic and cell fractionation data show that cocaine causes the translocation of Sig-1R from the ER into the nuclear membrane. After cocaine treatment, Sig-1R localized mainly in the envelope of the nucleus and, once there, interacted with lamin A/C and emerin, an inner nuclear membrane protein. Cocaine is known to cause addictive behavior by upregulating (MeCP2) in the brain. In rat primary cortical neurons, cocaine causes an increase in MeCP2. This effect is antagonized by Sig-1R antagonist BD1063. My results suggest that cocaine increases MeCP2 gene expression by translocating Sig-1Rs into the nuclear envelope to increase the NEI and grooving to facilitate the Sig-1R-lamina/emerin interaction to regulate the MeCP2 gene expression.

HYPOXIA INDUCED EFFECTS ON CHONDROCYTE PHENOTYPE
Sonam Alka Brahmbhatt
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

Many individuals acquire arthritis due to progressive, inevitable cartilage degradation. Current osteoarthritis treatments include artificial joint replacements, which leave patients less mobile. Cartilage culturing methods for replacement alternatives are being researched. The purpose of this study was to determine if and at which level of hypoxic stress premature-bone cells would display chondrocytic phenotype. Hypoxia levels tested were 21%, <10%, and <5% O2. Another objective was to determine the effects of hypoxia on cell-viability. It was hypothesized that cells placed under the most hypoxic stress would display evidence of chondrocyte differentiation and have the least viability.<br><br> Premature bone-cells were pellet cultured in conical microfuge tubes and incubated at the respective levels for 4 days. Four trials of GAG assays (for evidence of chondrocytic-phenotype) and cell-counts were conducted on days 0, 2, and 4 of incubation. Overall, the concentration of GAGs determined for all trials was statistically significant (p<0.001). Positive GAG levels were determined only for cells incubated at <10% O2 for 4 days. It was concluded that <10% O2 levels will instigate premature-bone cell differentiation into chondrocytes after a few days adjustment period. Overall, cell-viabilities were statistically significant (p<0.001). Decreased viability trends due to hypoxic stress were not observed, indicating that the cells can withstand hypoxic stress in pellet culture. High cell viability and success in determining the ideal O2 level validate the use of premature-bone cells under hypoxic stress for chondrocyte tissue culture, which can be put to applicable use in creating cartilage tissue for joint replacement and osteoarthritis prevention.

ANALYSIS OF CRITICAL PKC-DELTA SITES ON SARCOMERIC PROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION AND FUNCTION
Srisha R. Kotlo
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Cardiac troponin I (cTnI), an inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex, is a key regulator of cardiac muscle contractility. cTnI is phosphorylated by Protein Kinase C (PKC) at serine 23/24, serine 43/45, and threonine 144, sites which are crucial in the regulation of cardiac function. PKC-delta has a unique C2 domain that is thought to target PKC-delta to its substrates, and also has an ATP binding domain that contains the serine 357 phosphorylation site that may regulate PKC-delta’s substrate specificity for these specific sites. Here, we analyzed the kinase function and substrate specificity of PKC-delta-deltaC2 (C2 domain deleted) and PKC-delta-S357A (mutation from serine to alanine) mutants on sarcomeric proteins. Our results show that PKC-delta-deltaC2 and PKC-delta-S357A have increased autophosphorylation and increase the phosphorylation of TnI and TnT compared to wild type PKC-delta. The PKC-delta-S357A does not appear to confer a change in substrate specificity. This suggests that increased phosphorylation of TnI by PKC-delta-deltaC2, a known splice variant of PKC-delta, may be an underlying mechanism for depressed cardiac contractile function. Future experiments will test the functional effect of PKC-delta-deltaC2 on cardiac muscle contractility by measuring the force-Calcium and ATPase-Calcium relationship.

REGULATION OF TYPE II NATURAL KILLER T CELL CYTOKINE PRODUCTION BY SIGNALING LYMPHOCYTIC ACTIVATION MOLECULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN
Luke Wen Zhan
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

The project’s aim was to explore the signal pathway in interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) expression by type II Natural Killer T (NKT) cells in the presence or absence of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule-Associated Protein (SAP). We used a T cell receptor transgenic mouse model (24abTg) that expressed a TCR derived from a CD1d-autoreactive type II NKT cell line and crossed it onto a SAP deficient background. To investigate the mechanisms that contribute to IL-4 and IFN-g production by type II NKT cells, we isolated cDNA of type II NKT cells from wild type and SAP deficient backgrounds as templates for real time polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for different signaling pathways of IL-4 and INF-g. In particular, we examined the expression levels of transcription factors known to regulate the expression of IL-4 and INF-g in NKT cells. For IL-4, these factor included JunB, NFAT-a, NFAT-b, IRF-4, and GATA-3. In the case of IFN-g, only T-bet was screened. <br><br>After prolonged cell stimulation, both IRF-4 and GATA-3 expression was inhibited in SAP deficient type II NKT cells. NFAT-a, NFAT-b, JunB, and T-bet induction did not fluctuate significantly in the presence or absence of SAP. The reported defect in IL-4 expression directly corresponds with the decreased expression of GATA-3 and IRF-4, both of which may function downstream of SAP.

EFFECTS OF NF-KAPPA B ACTIVATION ON E6 EXPRESSION IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER CELLS
Shelly Vivian Li
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Cigarette smoking and infection with high risk human papillomaviruses are associated with head and neck cancer. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatment of head and neck cancer cells would increase cell invasiveness. We also hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of E6 oncoprotein expression and NF-kappa B activity would lead to decreased invasiveness and apoptosis. To determine how cigarette smoke might affect head and neck cancer cells, and to identify pharmacological agents that might be useful for the treatment or prevention of head and neck cancers, we measured the affects of CSE on the growth and invasive properties of two head and neck cell lines. We also assessed the abilities of thymoquinone, sulindac, and diclofenac to inhibit cancer cell growth and invasiveness. We found that treatment of cancer cells with CSE led to a dose-dependent increase in cell invasiveness in a invasion chamber assay. We also found, using an MTT dye assay, that thymoquinone, sulindac, and diclofenac inhibited cancer cell proliferation and led to apoptosis. These drugs also reduced cancer cell invasiveness in the invasion chamber assay. We conclude that the increased invasiveness caused by CSE can be inhibited by drugs known to inhibit E6 oncoprotein expression and NF-kappa B activation. This data suggested that the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation could be used therapeutically to prevent cigarette smoke-related cancers.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATHWAYS THAT GOVERN HEART DEVELOPMENT IN THE 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME
Aminah Abrar Sallam
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, commonly known as DiGeorge syndrome, is the most common micro-deletion syndrome in humans. It is characterized by craniofacial, parathyroid and thymic defects. The syndrome is also the most common with cardiac outflow tract malformations. Although most patients have a similar 3 million base pair deletion on 22q11.2, studies have shown that the gene TBX1 is likely responsible for the etiology of the disorder. Despite most patients having the same sized deletion, they exhibit significant clinical variability. As such, we examined how TBX1 drives heart development in an effort to understand how congential heart defects arise in affected individuals, and to identify potential genetic variants that may modify the phenotype of patients with the disorder. Using bioinformatic tools to analyze preexisting microarray data, we identified the genes CTNNB1 and c-JUN as intermediaries between TBX1 and its downstream targets in the heart. We also found that the genes GATA4, ACTN2, SLC8A1A, and DES, which all play a critical role in heart development, are also targets of TBX1. These findings clarify how the absence of TBX1 impacts heart formation at the different stages of heart development and have important implications for improving the quality of genetic counseling, as all genes identified can serve as genetic variants of the syndrome. Our positive results also suggest that bioinformatics is a useful and powerful tool for gene mining that allows geneticists to isolate candidate genes for further testing more efficiently than previous techniques allowed.

MEASURING CONFORMATIONAL FEATURES OF THE SPLICESOMAL U2-U6 SNRNA COMPLEX BY FRET
Mikaela Devorah Gerwin
The Abraham Joshua Heschel School, New York, NY

The spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein assembly within a cell’s nucleus that is responsible for removal of noncoding sequences, or introns, from precursor messenger (pre-m)RNA and ligation of coding regions, or exons before protein synthesis. The spliceosome contains five recyclable small nuclear (sn)RNAs, of which only a paired complex between U2 snRNA and U6 snRNA is directly involved in splicing chemistry. Several site-bound metal ions, specifically Mg2+, are required for activity. The goal of this research was to utilize Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to probe conformational features of the protein-free human U2-U6 snRNA complex in its resting state, that is, the conformation of the complex in vitro in the absence of Mg2+. This was accomplished by measuring distances between termini of helical stems of the complex. RNA samples were generated by in vitro transcription, and appropriate linkers and fluorescent dyes were attached by organic chemistry methods. The first set of steady state FRET data were not reproducible. These difficulties may have been due to incomplete labeling and purification of the RNA samples, low sample concentration, and/or incomplete pairing of the RNA. Additional experiments resulted in more reproducible data indicating FRET efficiency between points at the termini of two helices of 17%, a value that translated into a distance of 73 Å. Future FRET experiments will include placement of dyes in different locations to help define a three-dimensional model of the U2-U6 snRNA complex as well as conformational change in the presence of Mg2+ and splicesomal proteins.

PRIMER DESIGN AROUND TOBACCO MOSAIC RESISTANCE GENE IN PHASEOLUS VULGARIS
Johnna Jane Glover
Manatee High School, Bradenton, FL

The purpose of this experimentation was to design Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers to amplify the region of the Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) genome which contained the TM gene, and flanking genes Fe-reductase and Zn finger protein, to then display in electrophoresis gels to determine if the amplified gene was inherited from either the Jamapa (tm) or Calima (Tm) parents. An F2 progeny (n = 480) of the cross [Jamapa (suscept.) x Calima (resist.)] was used in the analysis. This progeny was screened with Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)- and PCR-based markers to determine the linkage relationship between the TM gene and the adjacent PCR markers. DNA from plants that displayed lesions (tm/tm) was extracted and analyzed by the PCR primers. Primers were designed on mutations between Jamapa and Calima genomes which provided a place of difference. The Tm_1 primer was placed on an indel mutation on Calima, while the 5’UTR and Prot_1 primers were designed based on base-pair substitutions which required later digestion from the restriction enzyme TaqI. After electrophoresis gels were ran and analyzed, the data displayed the source of inheritance of the TM and flanking genes. The uniformity and patterns of the bands supported the conclusion that the three genes extracted from recessive phenotypes were inherited from the Jamapa parent. Information gained about the source of the TM gene, will further agricultural advances and genetically engineering attempts for plants which are fatally affected by the TMV.

CAN FRUITS CONTAINING PROTEASES RUIN YOUR GELATIN DESSERT?
Lydia Frances Zemmali
North Atlanta High School, Atlanta, GA

Proteins are complex organic compounds that are formed from amino acids. Collagen is a structural protein found in the flesh and connective tissues in mammals. Gelatin is a protein made from collagen that has been chemically modified to solidify when cooking. Gelatin proteins are similar to microscopic strings because they are long, flexible, and they intertwine. Proteases are a group of proteolytic enzymes that function to hydrolyze proteins. Proteins must be broken down into amino acids to be absorbed into the body during digestion and proteases make this possible. Papain and bromelain are proteases that are often found in fruits such as, pineapple, kiwis,and mangoes, yet proteases are not in apples, raspberries, or strawberries. I hypothesized that if fruits containing proteases are added to the gelatin then it will not solidify, but if fruits not containing proteases are added to the gelatin then it will solidify. Fruits like pineapple contain bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme, and if pineapple is added to gelatin I think the bromelain in the pineapple will hydrolyze the gelatin proteins. This will keep the gelatin proteins from intertwining and forming pockets to hold the water, sugar, and fruit in place. I tested this by adding a fruit with proteases and a fruit without proteases to gelatin, and then I observed the solidification of each gelatin condition. The experiment proved that the gelatin containing proteases did not become stiff and the pineapple remained free-floating. The gelatin holding fruits without proteases were solid, stiff, and thick. In conclusion, it appears that fruits containing proteases do in fact ruin a gelatin dessert by causing no solidification.

LINKING MYELOID DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS AND T CELL MIGRATION THROUGH CLEAVAGE OF L-SELECTIN
Nancy Gao
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

The major goal of cancer immunotherapy is to activate the immune response against the tumor. Aided by the L-selectin adhesion protein, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells enter tumor-draining lymph nodes, where they are activated for tumor elimination. However, in cancer patients, T cell activation is inhibited by suppressive leukocytes named myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) accumulating in the blood. MDSC have been shown to cleave L-selectin from T cells in vitro. The project hypothesis is that the moderate decrease in L-selectin expression on T cells after co-incubation with MDSC will result in significant reduction but not complete elimination of T cell migration to lymph nodes in vivo. Blood was provided from a tumor-bearing BALB/c female mice for MDSC. Spleen was provided for T cells from healthy mice. T cells and MDSC were coincubated for 60 hours in the pilot and 18 hours in subsequent trials. They were labeled with antibodies and analyzed with flow cytometry for L-selectin. In the in vivo migration, cells co-incubated for 18 hours were injected by the project mentor into healthy mice. After 90 minutes, spleen and peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes were provided for analysis of T cell migration using flow cytometry. In the in T cell/MDSC coincubation, the 60 hour co-incubation showed no shift in L-selectin expression compared to T cells incubated alone, though the 18 hour co-incubation showed a moderate decrease. In the in vivo migration, a moderate decrease of T cell migration was observed in the lymph nodes. Evidence suggests that the hypothesis of a substantial decrease, but not a complete elimination, of T cell migration is correct and provides insight into its in vivo implications.

DISCOVERING AND DEFINING THE ROLE OF CILIA IN DERMAL STEM CELL COMMUNICATION
Sarthak Sinha
Henry Wise Wood High School, Calgary, CANADA

Despite the evidence of several population of stem cells interacting within the skin, establishing mechanisms of communication or interaction between different types of cells is known to be an essential step in developing therapeutic targets. This study supports that the mechanism for this signaling is through primary cilia, which are demonstrated to persist within adult hair follicles isolated from transgenic mice. Furthermore, the investigation demonstrates the presence of functional cilia in cultures of two distinct adult stem cells isolated within dermal niche, the epidermal stem cells and Skin Derived Precursors (SKPs). Upon robust localization, the investigation uncovers lithium chloride to cause a significant elongation of cilia length in cultures of dermal spheres. Following the elongation of cilia, immunohistochemistry demonstrates an upregulation of Sox 2 and Sox 9, two fundamental markers of adult stem cell hierarchy. Testing serial self-renewal capacity of SKPs, a significant increase is quantified in the diameter and the number of spherical colonies present when treated with lithium chloride and when lithium chloride is added in combination with PDGF-beta; when compared to PDGF-beta; alone. This suggests that signaling in cilia influences PDGF signals causing an enhanced effect on SKP self renewal; making it a very potent cocktail of dermal stem cell stimulant. It is further demonstrated that this cocktail can correct the lack of growth factors provided by epidermal stem cells in-vitro. This investigation imparts novel insight suggesting cilia as a therapeutic target and a mediator of somatic stem cell signaling; a concept, which may be applicable to other endogenous precursors.

A NOVEL PURIFICATION METHOD TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF FLUORESCENT PROTEINS APPLICATIONS
Nawaf Fawzan Fawzan Alfawzan
Riyadh Schools, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Due to high efficiency and insolubility, dyes produced by Fluorescent proteins (FP) have been implemented for a variety of applications, such as protein localization and also for studying gene expression. In order to use them, they have to be purified first. However, the purification method being used now, column method, is expensive, time consuming, and has a low efficiency. This project aims to overcome this obstacle by using a new purification method. This was accomplished by a new purification technique that takes advantage of the FPs’ high stability against heat; the procedure starts by expressing the protein in a strain of E.coli (BL 21) using the plasmid pET 303. Proceeded by the lysing of the host cell (E.coli). Then the appliance of high amount of temperature to the host cell, resulting in the denaturation of all proteins except for the FPs. Then, an organic solvent (ethanol) was used to remove the organic wastes. As a result, six different fluorescent proteins were purified with a purification percentage ranging between (80% to 100%), with a high yield (max. 480). FPs have a wide range of applications due to their stability under high temperatures, which makes them useful for new studies that aim at using these proteins as catalytic hosts, due to their high stability and organic solvent resistance. In addition, the stability and fluorescence of the FPs will be a target of future enhancement by the mutation of specific amino acids.

NOVEL GENE IDENTIFICATION USING THE TRANSPOSE ELEMENTS IN RHODOCOCCUS AETHERIVORANS PLASMID PRA3
Anas Mohamed Al Fadda

Genome annotation has a huge impact on molecular biology. Therefore, making an<br><br>annotated database using Rhodococcus aethreivorans bacteria will allow researchers to<br><br>have databanks that they can base upon their new research. Rhodococcus aethreivorans<br><br>bacteria has not been annotated before and there is almost no coding in bacterial<br><br>molecular biology. This database identifies certain elements called Transpose elements,<br><br>that encode important proteins. In order to create this database, inserting the pRA3 script<br><br>was the first step. The second step is marking the open reading frames which label genes<br><br>in this plasmid. The third step is using BLAST(Basic Local Alignment search tool) search<br><br>tool, which is the main tool that is used to identify genes. The fourth step is editing the<br><br>gene to differentiate between normal genes and transpose elements. The fifth step is<br><br>navigating the start of the sequence to know where the protein actually starts in order to<br><br>make the data base more accurate. Also, this annotation of this single plasmid took a<br><br>month and a half to be completed. Other genomes take up to 6-12 months. Thus, this will<br><br>save scientists a lot of time. In order to further develop this study, the annotation of other<br><br>bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus,<br><br>Streptococcus mutans will be completed. These transpose elements encode important<br><br>proteins such as: Replication Protein. Drug companies could focus on these points in<br><br>order to make the drug more efficient and concentrated.

A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR CIRRHOSIS: RETINOL-PALMITIC ACID TREATMENTS AND KNOCKDOWN OF THE MIR-23B CLUSTER REVERTS CIRRHOTIC HEPATIC STELLATE CELLS TO THE QUIESCENT STATE
Daniel Jeremy Fulop
John Jay High School, Cross River, NY

Cirrhosis of the liver affects over 100,000 people each year with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transform into activated fibroblasts during the onset of fibrosis, producing fibrous matrices and irreversible, rigid scar tissue; currently, the only feasible treatment is liver transplantation. As stellate cells become activated through this epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, they lose the ability to store 70% of the bodies Vitamin-A, mainly in the form of retinylpalmitate. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding regulatory RNAs, are dysregulated in a plethora of diseases. The miR-23b cluster has been shown to cause neonatal hepatocyte proliferation in mouse studies. For these reasons, this study aimed to determine whether activated fibroblasts could be reverted to the normal, quiescent state with both retinol-palmitic acid treatments and antisense-expressing miRZip plasmids. The combination retinol-palmitic acid treatment restored cell lipid droplet uptake and reduced gene expression levels of both ACTA2 and COL1A, indicators of HSC reversion. The next part of the study examined whether down regulation of the miR-23b cluster would yield similar results. Knockdown of the miR-23b cluster alone dramatically altered gene expression levels in a way indicative of reversion to the quiescent phenotype. This reversion and inactivation of stellate cells is reflective of the mechanism that would stop the progression of cirrhosis. The further understanding of the miR-23b cluster's role in cirrhosis potentiates the possibility to create an antisense-inhibitor drug for reverting cirrhotic HSCs to the healthy state, reducing hepatic stellate cell proliferation and liver scarring.

DIRECTED DIFFERENTIATION OF MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS INTO DORSAL ROOT GANGLIA
Ryan Malpass
Dobbs Ferry High School, Dobbs Ferry, NY

Pluripotent stem cells represent a new era in biological understanding and medical research, with a potential application in large-scale arrays for gene analysis and clinical drug testing. To realize this potential, stem cells must undergo efficient differentiation into defined adult lineages. By simulating the in vivo conditions of neural crest formation, a protocol is established for the in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into peripheral neural lineages. This is accomplished through a process of stromal cell-derived induced activity (SDIA), enrichment in a PA6 conditioned suspension culture with bFGF and EGF, and seeding on polyornithine, collagen and fibronectin coated plates with BDNF and NGF. Immunofluorescence imaging, RT-PCR and RNA sequencing confirm the viability of these cells as unmyelinated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) expressing markers such as p75 and Brn3a during the early transient stage and TuJ, Peripherin and TrpV1 during terminal differentiation. This approach lays the basis for the exploration of valuable research targets, particularly the Nav 1.7 sodium channel. This channel, expressed in the DRG at high density, is responsible for the peripheral perception of pain and may ultimately lead to a new class of non-addictive painkillers.

SODIUM IS ESSENTIAL FOR NA+/K+-ATPASE BLOCKADE AND ELECTRICAL STIMULATION INDUCED CANCER CELL LYSIS
Jack Duan-Xie Norleans
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States. Molecular targets are being widely explored to develop effective cancer treatments. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is one such target and is overexpressed in many types of cancer. It was found that the administration of Ouabain and electrical stimulation causes cancer cell lysis. It was theorized that Ouabain prevented sodium efflux by blocking the Na+/K+-ATPase and that electrical stimulation opened the VGSC, allowing sodium influx. This suggests that sodium is involved in cancer cell lysis. However, earlier tests showed that VGSC antagonists failed to prevent cancer cell lysis. This raises the question whether sodium is involved in cancer cell lysis. The purpose of this experiment is to test the role of sodium in cancer cell lysis.<br><br>3LL lung cancer, A549 lung cancer, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were administered Ouabain and electrical stimulation in cell medias with and without sodium. If the cell lysis occurred, the time taken for the cell to lyse was measured. <br><br>The average time taken cell lysis to occur in A549, 3LL, and MDA-MB-231 cells in the media with sodium was 141, 110, and 81 seconds respectively. None of the cells tested in sodium-free media lysed within the set time limit of 4-5 minutes while all of the cells tested in media with sodium lysed before that time limit. This demonstrates that sodium is essential for Na+/K+-ATPase antagonist and electrical stimulation induced cancer cell lysis.

DISCOVERING THE IMPACT OF AGING ON WHOLE TUMOR VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS ROLE OF DENDRITIC CELLS
Keven Joshua Stonewall
Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, Chicago, IL

The objective of these experiments was to determine if a tumor vaccine works in older mice while determining the makeup of the various DCs subsets after mitoxantrone treated tumor vaccination. To further dissect the age-related differences, it is essential to determine if moDCs are essential for tumor vaccine efficacy. <br><br>Tumor cells are treated with 1uM mitoxantrone/mitox for 24 hours in 75 cm2 culture flasks. The treated tumor cells are harvested, washed and 2 X 106 injected s.c. in the left flank. Seven days later 0.6 X 106 untreated CT26 tumor cells were injected in the right flank of the mouse.<br><br>Tumor-vaccine draining lymph nodes were harvested from mice two and four days after being vaccinated with mitoxantrone -treated CT26 tumor cells, as previously described. Dendritic cells were liberated from lymph nodes by disruption between two frosted glass slides and then enzymatically digested with collagenase for 30 minutes. Cells were enumerated and stained with various combinations of the following antibodies: FITC-B220, APC-CD11c, PE–CD40, PerCpCy5.5-Ly6c, pacific blue-CD11b, and APC Cy7-CD8. Harvested samples, isotype controls, and single stain controls were run on the FACSCantoII. <br><br>Age-related deficiencies in possibly two subsets of DCs attenuate the effectiveness of a whole tumor cell vaccine approach. The older mice surprisingly had fewer numbers of CD8+ and Plasmacytoid DCs in the young hosts. Depletion of the inflammatory moDCs in younger mice failed to decrease tumor vaccine effectiveness.

WEAR AND TEAR OR GENES IN GEAR? SINGLE NEURON AGE-DEPENDENT GENE EXPRESSION IN APLYSIA CALIFORNICA
Alexandra Saraleah Kaye
Palm Beach Lakes Community High School, West Palm Beach, FL

Human brain aging is a complex process and not well understood. Functional aging is associated with decline in cognitive abilities, motor skills and memory storage. To gain molecular and mechanistic insights into brain aging, the simple nervous system of marine snail Aplysia californica was explored. This snail is characterized by its simple nervous system and large easily identifiable neurons. This study focused on R15 neuron which is involved in regulating reproduction, the heart, and osmotic balance in Aplysia. The hypothesis of the study is that aging is associated with a decline or increase in expression of specific genes that lead to specific changes in the functioning of the brain. In conducting this study, microarray analysis was carried out using RNAs prepared from single R15 neurons isolated from mature and aged Aplysia. A total of 300 genes that are differentially regulated in R15 neurons were identified. Next, the genomic data was studied using DAVID, a bioinformatics program that helped in identifying signaling pathways. The results were then verified using quantitative PCR. Results demonstrated there was a significant decrease in the expression of specific genes identified, such as protein kinases and growth factors, which supported the hypothesis made. Surprisingly, an increase in gene expression of specific genes in R15 neuron from old animals was also found. The conclusion from the single neuron microarray results was that aging does not cause global decrease in gene expression, but rather specific changes that lead to either up or down regulation of a gene set.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE XENOPUS LAEVIS OOCYTE EXPRESSION SYSTEM
Aakash Jain
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

This research project examines the effect of the follicular membrane on the efficiency of the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, an ex vivo experimental model commonly used in various biological fields, such as cellular biology, developmental biology, toxicology, neuroscience, and electrophysiology. Through quantitative observation of oocyte lifespan and gene expression, this project seeks to describe a more economical methodology for studies that use X. laevis as a model organism.<br><br> In phase 1 of this project, 270 X. laevis oocytes were divided into groups of 30 by varying their exposure to the enzyme collagenase, which breaks down their follicular membrane. Over the span of one month, these cells were observed. Cells that were unhealthy, discolored, or otherwise unfit for electrophysiological experimentation were discarded and considered dead. After one month, the data indicate that the presence of follicle cells has a significant impact on the oocyte life cycle. <br><br> Cells that were treated with collagenase for less than 30 minutes performed the best and a large majority of them were still alive at the end of the month. On the other hand, oocytes that were exposed to collagenase for 70 minutes or more did not fare nearly as well. In fact, all of the oocytes that received the maximum enzyme exposure, 80 minutes, died within 18 days of initial harvest. Oocytes that received mid-level enzyme treatment also followed this pattern and exhibited medium survival rates. <br><br> Two analyses of variance were conducted for the data of Phase 1. Both returned relatively high F values and nearly infinitesimal p values. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative for Phase 1. <br><br> Phase 2 is still in progress.

ANALYSIS OF CHANGES REGARDING INSULIN SIGNALING IN RESPONSE TO HIGH FAT DIET AND AGING
Trevor James Krolak
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Type II Diabetes is a condition that has been shown to be linked both to obesity and aging in humans, yet few studies have studied the combined interaction of these two factors in the cellular-level emergence of the disease. In my experimental model, frozen tissue samples were obtained from professional studies on young and middle aged Fischer-344 rats. In the previous study, these animals were fed either control or high-fat diets for 4.5 months. Subsequent analysis studied the impacts of dieting and aging on their insulin sensitivity and whole body metabolic syndrome.<br><br> While tissue from subjects previously exposed to high fat diet treatment exhibited signs of impending peripheral metabolic dysregulation, in increased weight gain compared to the control diet and a higher bodily fat content, they did not in fact exhibit expected diabetic symptoms. Blood insulin levels did not significantly change, and moreover, Western Blotting of tissue supernatants indicated a resistance to changes in the levels of IR and IRS-1, proteins associated with the initial steps of the insulin signaling pathway, in both adipose and nervous tissue. Aging in fact increased the presence of IRS-1, suggesting heightened insulin sensitivity in the periphery. <br><br> The consistently high presence of adiponectin in the blood stream of subjects across all treatment groups suggests a potential role for this protein in resisting the onset of environmentally induced diabetes, and merits additional study. Additionally, the F-344 is tentatively established as a model organism notable for a high degree of resistance against environmentally induced diabetes.

NATURAL SELECTION TEST FOR THE FOXP2 GENE IN AMAZONA VITTATA
Cristal Imar Hernandez Hernandez
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

FOXP2 is a gene shown to be necessary for speech and language acquisition in humans. It codes for a transcription factor of the winged-helix family, known for playing important roles in terminal development. Selection tests have strongly suggested that this gene has undergone positive selection during the evolution of humans and that is responsible for these human-specific traits. This project aimed to find out if FOXP2 has also undergone selection in parrots, using the Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata) as model species. Therefore, the hypothesis stated that the evolution of FOXP2 between Amazona and other bird species was not neutral, and the rate of nucleotide substitutions producing amino acid changes (Ka) will be significantly different to the rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks). The Amazona genome was obtained from genomes.uprm.edu/parrot and the FOXP2 sequence was identified through sequence comparisons with other species. Its structure was annotated using several bioinformatics tools. Comparisons to other bird and mammal species showed a high level of evolutionary conservation both in protein sequence and gene structure. The few protein sequence differences were all outside of the DNA-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis produced predictable results, clustering all bird species together and apart from mammal species. In conclusion, all bird species lacked the two mutations that are human-specific among primates since the Ka/Ks analysis for the Amazona – chicken – zebra finch trio accepted the alternate hypothesis, since Ka/Ks analysis values << 1 were obtained for all comparisons, consistent with negative selection and making no significant changes in its function.

THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON DNA
Shelby Brooke Cyr
Valley-Edinburg High School, Edinburg, ND

I determined how frequency, wavelength, and radiation time affects DNA using Drosophila (fruit fly) S2 culture cells as a model system. The cells were treated with UV radiation (300 microW/cm2), with varying times (in sec.:0,5,10,15,30,60). In parallel, cells were treated with Gamma radiation (isotope Cesium 137), with varying times (sec); 0,10(0.6 Gy),15(0.96 Gy),30(1.91 Gy),60(3.83 Gy),120(7.66 Gy). I assessed damage using the Comet Assay, involving electrophoresis of cells followed by fluorescence-based detection of DNA. DNA damage is assessed by the appearance of small DNA fragments in irradiated samples, which have high electrophoretic mobility forming the so-called "tail" comets that can be detected under a microscope. I used two types of Comet Assay: TBE electrophoresis for double-stranded damage, and Alkaline electrophoresis for single-stranded damage. To calculate percentage of DNA in the tail, I used the Image J program on 12 cells from each sample. Conclusions and Data: 1. The longer the UV and Gamma exposure, the greater the single-stranded DNA damage. UV radiation: Control-10.1%, 5 s-82.1%, 15 s-83.1%. Gamma radiation: C-16.2%, 10 s-73.4%, 15 s-70.9%, 30 s-75.3%, 60 s-92.9%, 120 s-93%. 2. Longer UV and Gamma exposures cause single-stranded DNA fragments to escape into the background, making it difficult to quantify, indicating extensive DNA damage that may go beyond the sensitivity of the Comet Assay. 3. At higher UV and Gamma exposure times, the nuclei become distorted & misshapen. 4. UV causes primarily single-stranded damage; whereas Gamma causes both single and double-stranded DNA damage. This observation agrees with other experiments done by other scientists. 5. In TBE and Alkaline electrophoresis, the 15 s time period varied from the pattern.

ALTERED MICRORNA EXPRESSION IN COLON CANCER PROGRESSION
Pooja N. Prasad
Bellaire High School, Bellaire, TX

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide. The most frequent genetic mutation in hereditary and sporadic cases of CRC is in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene. The altered levels of microRNAs (miRNA) may be an underlying mechanism in the progression to carcinoma and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in miRNA expression in early stages of CRC using the Apc(min/+) mouse and human Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) polyps . <br><br> Microarray analysis of mouse adenomas revealed several dysregulated miRNAs. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that most of these changes were similar to the expression pattern seen in more advanced stages of human CRC except for miR-143 and miR-31 which were up and down regulated respectively in contrast to that in CRC. Expression levels of miR-143 and miR-131 in FAP tissues (loss of Apc function), was similar to mouse adenomas and contrast to that in CRC stages II-IV. In vitro transfection of miRNA mimics into YAMC cells showed increased cell proliferation with miR-143 and decreased cell proliferation with miR-31. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 55% of CRC patients had alterations in genes that are targeted by miR-143 as compared to 16% of CRC patients who had alterations in genes targeted by miR-31. <br><br> Based on these results, it can be concluded that the switch in expression pattern of miR-143 could be used as a biomarker to identify adenomas that would progress to CRC and help in designing new treatment options using microRNA based therapy.

THE USE OF ANTIOXIDANTS TO COMBAT IN VITRO LIPID PEROXIDATION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Iman Mahoui
Eman Schools, Fishers, IN

Research was conducted on the effectiveness of three different antioxidants, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and resveratrol in protecting against oxidative damage in two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a wild strain and a mutant strain. The mutant strain lacks the GSH1 gene, whose product encodes for the synthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the enzyme responsible for the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of glutathione. Following the induction of oxidative damage by exposure to aerobic conditions, a thiobarbituric reactive substances assay (TBARS) was used to quantify malondialdehyde, an indication of the extent of lipid peroxidation and, therefore, oxidative damage. Contrary to expectation, yeast samples treated with glutathione had a significantly lower level of oxidative damage compared to those treated with other antioxidants. Additionally, yeast samples exposed to both glutathione and ascorbic acid exhibited evidence of the greatest level of oxidative damage. As expected, all mutant strain samples had consistently greater evidence of oxidative damage than wild-type strains. The greater cytoprotective properties of glutathione, the ability of glutathione to be effective both intra- and extracellularly, as well as its effectiveness in entering the cell, likely allows it to protect against lipid peroxidation and other effects of oxidative damage to a greater extent than resveratrol or ascorbic acid. Therefore, glutathione may provide an effective measure to protect against ischemia and/or reperfusion injuries.

THE EFFECT OF GYY4137 ON THE DIFFERENTIATION OF DENTAL PULP STEM CELLS INTO HEPATIC CELLS
Manotri Chaubal
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Stem cells derived from bone marrow are pluripotent, thus, capable of giving rise to several different cell types. Of particular medical importance is its differentiation into hepatocytes. Diseases, such as cirrhosis, often require renewed liver tissue or liver transplants. However, there are several obstacles to stem cell extraction from the bone marrow such as a painful recovery period for patients and a low number of harvested cells. Therefore, it is important to find an alternative stem cell source. Dental pulpal tissue from the human third molars or deciduous teeth is an easily accessible source of stem cells that is often discarded. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) have been shown to differentiate into many different cell lines; however, when tested, few have proven to be viable. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the hydrogen sulfide donor GYY4137 on the viability of hepatic differentiation in dental pulp stem cells. To conduct this experiment four procedures were performed. First, the DPSCs were isolated from sterilized teeth using a dental handpiece and a series of washes. Then, an initial culture of mesenchymal stem cells was grown. These cells were further differentiated using hepatocyte growth factor and incubated in the presence of GYY4137. The differentiated cells were finally characterized using RT-PCR to measure the expression of a specific hepatocyte marker, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. The Countess Cell Counter was used with trypan blue dye to measure viability.

Food induced anaphylaxis is on the rise worldwide, however the reasons for the significantly higher prevalence of peanut allergies is not understood. Though recent epidemiological studies suggest a strong link between parasitic infection and the development of allergies and autoimmune disease, a direct molecular link between peanut allergies and parasites has not been established.<br><br>This project examines the relationship between peanut allergens and parasite proteins to explain what role – if any – protein homology may play in their increased reactivity. Using the pBLAST algorithm, protein homology between the Ara h allergens and the parasite proteome was analyzed. Then, a Western Blot probed with monoclonal anti-Ara h 1 antibodies was used to test for cross-reactivity between P. falciparium proteins and peanut allergens, with peanut and human macrophage protein lysates acting as positive and negative controls respectively.<br><br>Top parasite BLAST alignment scores and E-values demonstrate a clear skew towards stronger local protein alignments with peanuts when compared to the human control, and a faint band identified in the Western suggests the presence of a similar epitope between Ara h 1 and a parasite protein. Sequence analysis demonstrates that complete protein homology is not a significant factor for the major peanut allergens, however local protein alignments mimicking specific parasite epitopes may play a significant role.<br><br>This is the first time protein homology between specific peanut allergens and parasite proteins have been investigated. Understanding the link between peanuts and parasites is essential to direct future research towards more effective treatments, and an eventual cure.

IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISMS OF AFP AND GPC3 INTERNALIZATION BY HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) CELL.
Aaron Angelo Kamuela Ponce
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Several HCC-specific tumor antigens, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and glypican-3 (GPC3), have been identified. The oncofetal antigen AFP is naturally produced as well as endocytosed by HCC cells, where it is thought to regulate steroid receptor-mediated cell growth. Soluble GPC3, a heparin sulfate proteoglycan that can be detected in HCC patient blood, is thought to regulate HCC cell viability and correlates with poor prognosis. Little is known, however, about the mechanism(s) by which HCC cells endocytose AFP and GPC3, although a role for C-type lectin receptors (CLR) and scavenger receptors in AFP internalization has recently been proposed. In this project, we hypothesized that HCC cells internalize AFP, and potentially GPC3, via specific CLRs and/or scavenger receptors. First, we fluorescently-labeled GPC3 and two glycoforms of AFP: cord blood-derived normal AFP (nAFP) and HCC tumor-derived AFP (tAFP), which differ at a single carbohydrate group. We then co-cultured fluorescent nAFP, tAFP, and GPC3 with the HCC cell line HepG2 in the presence or absence of inhibitors of specific endocytic pathways and assessed antigen uptake by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Inhibition of pinocytosis (receptor-independent endocytosis) and scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis extensively abrogated HepG2 uptake of both glycoforms of AFP, while uptake of GPC3 appeared to occur exclusively via pinocytosis. These data are consistent with the observed high levels of the scavenger receptors LOX-1, CD36, and SR-B1 expressed by HepG2 cells. Further characterization of the function and biology of AFP and GPC3 in the setting of HCC will enable rational drug design for patients with this disease.

OPTIMIZING IMMUNITY: ENGINEERING T CELLS TO TARGET CANCER THROUGH STRUCTURE-BASED DESIGN
Sarah Catherine Briann Baker
Penn High School, Mishawaka, IN

One of the most important aspects of our bodies’ defense against cancer involves membrane proteins on the surfaces of T cells. These T cell receptors, or TCRs, can recognize tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) on cancer cell membranes. When a TCR recognizes a TAA, signals are sent that stimulate the T cell to activate an immune response against that cancer cell. Unfortunately, binding affinity between TCRs and TAAs is often weak. This means that TCRs are unable to effectively recognize TAAs, and as a result cancer cells can go unchallenged by the immune system. Scientists are trying to address this by creating T cells that express engineered TCRs capable of binding TAAs with stronger affinity. This project addresses ways to engineer such higher affinity TCRs. Specifically, this project explores the use of structure based design to predict mutations that will increase the binding affinity of a TCR. The effects of mutations predicted by a computer algorithm on TCR binding affinity were measured and are presented in this poster. These results will be utilized to improve the prediction process, eventually leading to a general and accurate procedure to design TCRs for tumor-specific cancer immunotherapy.

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT OF LENTINUS EDODES ON METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND ITS ANTINEOPLASTIC EFFECT ON BREAST CANCER CELL LINE MDA-MB-231
Sydney Kaye Mann, Lachonda Lacey, Elijah English
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of these researchers’ project is twofold. First is to test a natural mushroom extract, Lentinus Edodes, versus a synthetic medication for the cytotoxic activity towards cultured breast cancer cells, specifically the human cell line MDA-MB-231; as well as to determine if Lentinus edodes has an antimicrobial effect on Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) to help and ensure a healthy patient during treatment.<br><br>These researchers hypothesized that Lentinus edodes would inhibit the growth of MRSA to help aid a patient’s suppressed immune system and will cause the apoptosis of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.<br><br>To begin experimenting, the Lentinus edodes was filtered and mixed with the MRSA in different dilutions (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8). After a time period of 24 and 48 hours, the bacteria and lentinus edodes mixtures were plated. After 24 hours of incubation the plates were analyzed for inhibition of bacteria growth in comparison to the MRSA control. For the testing of the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, unfiltered and filtered lentinus edodes was tested by injecting different increments of the lentinus edodes into the wells. The lentinus edodes was titrated with the breast cancer cell line inside of the wells to ensure that they were thoroughly mixed. A trypan blue assay test was performed after the cells were incubated so that the percentage of cell death could be determined after time increments of 24 and 48 hours. <br><br>When analyzing the data for the MRSA, after both 24 and 48 hours, increasing the dilution of the extract proved to be unsuccessful, however, when the lentinus edodes wasn't diluted it effectively inhibited the growth of the bacteria. When analyzing the data for the breast cancer cell line, it proved to work more effectively than the positive control, Doxorubicin, from intervals of 16 microliters to 128 microliters. <br><br>In conclusion, these researchers can support their hypothesis that the lentinus edodes can act as an effective antibacterial and antineoplastic effect.

THE EXPRESSION OF THIOREDOXIN IN METHANOSARCINA ACETIVORANS
Kate Campbell Woolverton, Blake Bradberry
Haas Hall Academy, Fayetteville, AR

The modern world depends on energy from fossil fuels. The scientific community is scrambling to replace the limited reserves of these fuels as the world's energy consumption escalates. A viable, untapped option is the use of methanogens, which produce methane. Methane is the main component of biofuel. As methanogens are anaerobic, and therefore unable to live in oxygen-rich environments, their widespread use, and the ability to study them, is hampered. It is vital that their oxygen coping mechanisms are better understood.<br><br>Thioredoxin is a protein that reduces harmful disulphide bonds caused by oxygen. The question "Is thioredoxin coded for in the genome of M. acetivorans?" The hypothesis was that Methanosarcina acetivorans held the code for thioredoxin in its DNA (thus having the potential to protect itself from oxygen exposure). Methodology entailed: 1) the cloning of target genes; 2) the insertion of these genes into E. coli via the pet28 plasmid; 3) the induction of the cells to produce the target proteins; and, 4) the purification and assay of target protein. The data indicate that the target gene did most likely code for thioredoxin.

A STUDY OF THE ROLE OF THE ROCK KINASE PATHWAY IN DENTAL PULP STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND MINERALIZATION
Aneri Kinariwalla, Evan Chernack
Sayville High School, West Sayville, NY

Millions are affected by skeletal and dental defects. Regenerative therapies offer a viable strategy for the treatment of such faults and associated diseases. Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) are ideal candidates for use due to their high proliferative potential, multipotency, and easy accessibility. Such therapies are severely restricted by a lack of sufficient blood supply. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, can be encouraged by the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK). However, it is believed that the inhibition of this pathway may impede DPSC differentiation in response to inductive factors, including soluble factors and substrate mechanics. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, Y27632, a ROCKI/II inhibitor, was used to block ROCK activity. Cells were observed for 28 days for signs of differentiation. Though ROCK inhibition initially had an effect on DPSC actin organization and relative modulus, the effect diminished over time, allowing cells to differentiate. This implies that ROCK is initially an important pathway for the cells to sense and respond to soluble factors and substrate mechanics. Other kinase pathways may gradually compensate for the absence of ROCK, either because an alternate pathway is activated as a result of ROCK being blocked or because the ROCK pathway plays a role only in the initial stages of differentiation. Because the results strongly imply that the cells are able to differentiate when ROCK is inhibited, it is proposed that the inhibition of ROCKI/II, which activates sprouting angiogenesis has great potential for future regenerative stem cell therapies.

ON THE CONNECTIVITY OF SEQUENTIAL FORMAL LANGUAGES WITH APPLICATIONS TO GENOMIC SEQUENCES
Jessica Minya Wang, Lily Xu, Susan Xu
Liberal Arts and Science Academy, Austin, TX

In protein and genomic sequence analysis, it is important to compare genetic sequences, such as when looking at mutations. From graph theory, numerous metrics and similarities have been defined for string comparison, including the Hamming metric, the Staiger metric, and the Levenshtein metric. These have been applied to comparing genomic sequences. However, each metric has its disadvantage, so we create new metrics to calculate the distance between a DNA sequence and a mutated sequence. We determine the relation between sequences by applying a threshold, epsilon>0. By calculating with our metrics the distance between sequences, we determine if sequences are related by whether the distance is within a given epsilon>=0. With a set of sequences S, we generate epsilon-chains, sequences of strings in S with the distance between each pair of successive strings less than or equal to epsilon. By defining the persistence of S as the length of the range of values of such that the same epsilon-chains are generated for each value of epsilon within the range, we pinpoint ranges of epsilon which reveal the mutability allowed while retaining the same epsilon-connectivity. By applying this to the human CFTR gene, we determine ranges of epsilon that can determine whether a patient may display cystic fibrosis. We also apply this to the nucleotide sequence for NS1 in influenza A viruses to predict future NS1 protein mutations. There are several other applications of our methodology including modeling protein folding.

Emory Morris Payne, Zohaib Moonis
Bancroft School, Worcester, MA

Excess alcohol during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with<br><br>morphological abnormalities, and may result in pancreatic damage. This study<br><br>investigated the relationship between Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Type 1 Diabetes using<br><br>a zebrafish model. Embryos were exposed to increasing concentrations of ethanol during<br><br>pancreatic development. Six experimental groups were created exposing embryos to<br><br>0.10%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.5% EtOH. The control group exposed<br><br>embryos to 0% EtOH. The embryos were graded (scale 0-4) based on the level of beta<br><br>cell degradation in the pancreas; 0 being no cell degradation and 4 indicating complete<br><br>degradation. Beta cell degradation increased directly proportional to increasing EtOH<br><br>concentrations, as seen in a decrease in grade 0 and increase in other grades. Zero<br><br>percent EtOH resulted in 82.35% grade 0 fish while 1.5% EtOH resulted in 0% grade 0<br><br>fish. A graded response was observed with increasing EtOH concentrations, resulting in<br><br>82.14%, 70.97%, 52.08%, 63.64%, and 8.51% grade 0 fish for other concentrations. As<br><br>the percentage of grade 0 fish decreased, percentage of fish classified in grades 1-4<br><br>increased. For example, 0.1% EtOH exposure resulted in 82.14% grade 0 fish, 3.57%<br><br>grade 1, 0% grade 2, 0% grade 3, and 14.29% grade 4 compared to 8.51% grade 0,<br><br>36.17% grade 1, 29.79% grade 2, 14.89% grade 3, and 25.53% grade 4 with exposure to<br><br>1% EtOH. This study suggests that alcohol consumed during the first trimester of<br><br>pregnancy, may result in a higher risk for Type 1 Diabetes.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLES OF A2A AND TRKB RECEPTOR PROTEINS IN RESPONSE TO CHOLESTEROL AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR IN AN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE MODEL
Jessica Leigh Joyce, Heidi Smith
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of neural tissue, accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid plaques, and decreased TrkB activity, leading to the degeneration of neurons via apoptosis. In 2012, the Alzheimer’s Association predicted that $1.1 trillion will be spent on care for victims of Alzheimer’s in 2050. This study attempts to elucidate the mechanisms through which two membrane receptors, the TrkB and A2A receptors, with roles in the formation of beta-amyloid plaque and subsequent cell survival interact with increased concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cholesterol. Receptor antagonists were used to elucidate the roles of each protein in response to cholesterol and BDNF in an IMR-32 cell line. Our results showed that extracellular cholesterol increases beta-amyloid production, and that A2A activity also increases beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. Previous research shows TrkB activity signals cells to synthesize cholesterol in lipid rafts. Decreased levels of beta-amyloid seen in this experiment in the presence of high concentrations of BDNF and extracellular cholesterol suggest that extracellular cholesterol provided in treatments can be used instead of new cholesterol synthesized by the cell for lipid rafts after TrkB activation. Results also demonstrate the ability of A2A to transactivate TrkB despite absence of BDNF or presence of TrkB antagonist, suggesting a possible pathway to reactivate TrkB receptors in Alzheimer’s victims and prevent neurodegeneration.

HEDGEHOG-GLI SIGNALING PROMOTES CELL PROLIFERATION AND EPITHELIAL-TO-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION IN LUNG CANCER
Thomas Michael Luh, Joy Jin
Leland High School, San Jose, CA

Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with a majority of patients diagnosed with metastatic phenotypes. However, it remains a scientific challenge to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on molecular mechanisms of cancer and metastatic processes. Previous studies on Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), characterized by loss of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and increase in cell mobility, indicate its involvement in the metastatic process. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway is implicated in various carcinomas, including lung cancer. EMT regulation through the Hh pathway has emerged in literature, but data remain controversial.<br><br>We hypothesize that Hh activation of the downstream Gli family of proteins promotes cell proliferation and EMT, leading to lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our data demonstrated elevated Gli expression in tumors, and suggested inverse correlations between Gli and E-cadherin in both non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and patient samples through immunofluorescence stainings, western blots and quantitative RT-PCR. Results from cell migration and viability assays indicated that Gli inhibition reduced tumor cell regeneration, with increased Hh/Gli signaling promoting cell migration through downregulation of E-cadherin at protein and RNA levels. Similar investigations with Vimentin, a protein marker found in mesenchymal cells, further confirmed our data, indicating a positive correlation between Vimentin and Gli and consequently Hh/Gli significance in promoting cell proliferation and EMT in lung cancer. Thus, we believe Hedgehog-Gli signaling holds great promise as a potential novel drug target in combating the deadliness of lung cancer.

INDICTING ALZHEIMER'S: NOVEL METHODS OF PREVENTING GLIAL SCARRING THROUGH THE DOWNREGULATION OF CEREBRAL VIMENTIN AND GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN
Tejas Dharmaraj, Manav Sevak
Chandler High School, Chandler, AZ

Astrocytes, a class of glial cells in the brain, contain two major intermediary filaments (IF): glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin (VIM). In the event of neurotrauma, a neurochemical cascade is initiated leading to the upregulation of these two proteins. The researchers conducted an investigation to determine the impact of the chemical Withaferin A (WFA), an extract of Withania somnifera, on the production of GFAP and VIM. With additional research indicating that the downregulation of GFAP and VIM could prevent diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Alexander’s, it was apparent to the researchers that the application of WFA to a model of astrogliosis could prove instrumental in providing a preventative measure against such diseases. A controlled experiment was then conducted to determine the impact of WFA on the recovery and health of astrocytes after mechanically induced trauma. Experimentation confirms that the neurochemical cascade can be regulated by the use of WFA and that the use of WFA greatly assists in post-trauma recovery of astrocytes and downregulates GFAP and VIM. This means that glial scarring and acute effects such as paralysis and some impaired cognitive function can be prevented but further the predisposition to neurodegenerative conditions is lessened. Based on the research collected, it was postulated that Withaferin A is a potentially viable treatment for astrogliosis caused by trauma to human hippocampal and frontal lobe astrocytomas. Potential applications of this research include an intravitreal or automatic treatment for stroke and trauma patients.

SUBTROPICAL STUDY OF MINE DRILLED LAKES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON EVAPORATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
Breanne Mattea Williams
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of this project is to determine if the evaporation rate of mine drilled lakes in Florida is greater than the evapotranspiration rate of the native plant life. It is hypothesized that the mine drilled lakes in Florida will lose more water through evaporation than the plant life would lose through evapotranspiration. <br><br>Procedure is to set up a Class A evaporation pan, an evapotranspiration device, a wind gauge, rain gauge, and a floating thermometer in at least two different areas in the state. Record readings 2 times a week for 2 months. Plug the data into the alpha equation. Next, plug your alpha and data into three corresponding formulas to calculate Lake Evaporation. Determine the ratio of Lake Evaporation to Pan Evaporation. Calculate the difference between Lake Evaporation and the Evapotranspiration rate. <br><br>The results of this project were that the north and south regions of Florida had a difference between the plant life of positive decimals 0.01 through 0.37. Thus the hypothesis was supported because the lakes lost more water than the plant life.

SINKHOLES
Chase Logan Kicker
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

A sinkhole is a large depression in the ground surface that results from the collapse of an underground cavity. I became interested in sinkholes because of the possible sinkhole that could occur at the I&W Brine Well Site in Carlsbad. I wanted to study the factors that could affect sinkhole development and propose a solution to stabilize the underground cavity and prevent sinkhole occurrence. This research is important because a sinkhole at the I&W Site could be catastrophic. A church, feed store, residences, a highway, and an irrigation canal are potentially in the sinkhole area. The problem that I tested was what type of flowable fill material could be developed to efficiently prevent the formation of a sinkhole on the surface. I believed that with the extensive use of relatively inexpensive fillers in a cement-based grout, a workable material could be developed. To test this hypothesis, I mixed a range of fill materials using fly ash, fill dirt, cement, and brine. I cured the samples and tested them using a compressive strength testing machine. Based on the testing results, I concluded that a fill material consisting of 65% fly ash, 25% fill dirt, and 10% cement would provide a cost effective grout with suitable compressive strength to prevent sinkhole occurrence at the I&W Site.

INCREASING CASKET DECOMPOSITION RATES, YEAR TWO
Lauren Rymer Mandaville
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

In many countries such as Israel, burial space is limited. A growing Western trend adopts the Jewish practice of "natural burial" in which a body without embalming is interred in a wooden casket. The purpose of the study was to determine if inexpensive soil additives can significantly increase the number of decomposers present and speed the rate of decomposition of buried wood. Eight five-gallon microcosms were filled with 0.1 L2 each of either sandy or clay soil from freshly dug graves. Twenty pieces of Populus deltoides, ten with clear wood finish and ten not finished, were weighed and interspersed in each microcosm. One microcosm of each soil type served as a control and an additive of 250 cc of nitrogen, 250 cc of lime, or 2250 cc of organic peat was placed into the remaining microcosms. Five hundred mL of water was added every fourteen days; the runoff was collected and measured. After 140 days, the samples were oven dried and weighed again. The weight of the original moisture content was discounted. The relative mass loss of the wood samples exposed to nitrogen, lime and organic peat was then compared to the controls . Results indicated that there was an optimum level of decomposers present (measured through CO2 emissions) and a statistically significant increase in mass loss for the samples exposed to organic peat regardless of either the soil type or the finished state of the wood. In conclusion, inexpensive soil additives will speed the rate of wood decomposition.

A TWO-DIMENSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING PRINCIPLES
Jacob Floyd Nichols
Brush High School, Brush, CO

This research project was conducted to study principles behind hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as ‘fracking,’ is used all around the country. It has greatly increased yields and profits in the oil and natural gas industries. I wanted to study fracking more in depth to see how exactly it works. More specifically, I wanted to investigate how increased pressures had an affect on fracturing.<br><br> To study this, I built an apparatus for the fracturing to be formed in. This included a Petri Dish filled with a slurry of glass beads and water. The lid of the dish was inverted to contain the slurry without letting air out. A syringe was connected to the bottom of the dish to introduce air into the slurry. This airflow created the fracturing. In the apparatus, the slurry of glass beads represented a rock layer and the introduction point of air represented one perforation hole in a horizontal drill system. <br><br> Once the apparatus was constructed, experimentation could begin. This was done by introducing air into the slurry of glass beads and simultaneously taking pictures of the fractures forming. Pressures on the slurry were varied by changing masses placed on the top of the Petri Dish. Multiple trials were ran at differing pressures. Because a high speed camera was used, the picture depicting optimal formation could be obtained for each trial. These pictures were then analyzed. <br><br> The pictures were analyzed using different systems of grids. Both circular grids and rectangular grids were placed on the pictures to count the amount of grid sections occupied. The amount of occupied grid sections shows how much fracturing occurs. For each trial at each pressure the pictures were analyzed and the amount of grid sections occupied determined. Averages were then found. <br><br> The numbers were graphed and showed a general increase in amount of grid sections occupied for both small and large masses. This proved the hypothesis correct. If the model is applied to real life fracking, more fracturing would occur at greater depths underground. Drilling companies could increase yields and profits by selecting deeper plays of oil and natural gas.

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED ALUMINUM PHOSPHATE ON THE SEQUESTERING OF CO2 DONE BY PHYTOPLANKTON
Daniella Deanna Bernadel
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this project it's to determine if the presence of Aluminum Phosphate would alter the Cyclotella's cell count and lower the atmospheric CO2 ppm level. It is hypothesized that Cyclotella cultures enriched with a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate will have a higher mean cell count. It is also hypothesized that Cyclotella cultures enriched with a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate will have a lower "atmospheric" CO2 level. This experiment is significant because it deals with the problem of global warming an the greenhouse effect. <br><br>In order to collect data, cyclotella cultures were divided into 4 groups. These groups were treated with varying levels of Phosphate.In the CO2 portion of the project each of the four groups had three test tubes. Each test tube was filled with 1000 ppm of CO2 and was left in the enviornmental chamber for a 24 hour period. After the CO2 treatment, the test tubes were removed and CO2 was measured again. <br><br>In conclusion, the hypotheses were accepted because the Cyclotella enriched in a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate had a higher cell mean count and a lower atmospheric CO2 level than the Cylotella cultures not enriched in a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate.

THE MINNIE LYNCH: A COMPARATIVE STUDY IN THE AFFECTS OF PARENT MATERIAL ON WATER QUALITY IN EPHEMERAL STREAMS
Brisha Nicole Wakasugi
Alamosa High School, Alamosa, CO

Is the parent material of the Rawley Andesite/ Bonanza Tuff Contact, which contains permanent and ephemeral stream flows, a contributing factor in compromise water quality in the Minnie Lynch Drainage? The hypothesis looked at was ephemeral streams flowing from the Rawley Andesite/ Bonanza Tuff Contact contain minerals and metlas, however they are not in high enough concentrations to compromise the water quality of the Minnie Lynch Drainage. The source of the contaminatino at te drainage is strictly due to the mining practices and untreated tailing piles of the area. <br><br>The data collected for this project matched the same pattern of the data collected in 2010. The waters closest to the adit of the Minnie Lynch Drainage had extremely acidic pH's, inadequate TDS and conductivity levels, and decreasing metal concentrations. Then as the stream continued the metal concentrations began to increase, and the pH, conductivity, and TDS levels began to nuetralize. Then as the wates reached the alluvial fan the metal concentrations decreased once again, the pH levels became more acidic, and the TDS and conductivity levels worsened.<br><br>The samples taken from the spring were the ones with the most interesting results. Data from the water collected from the springs showed that there were high concentrations of elements such as Zinc, Manganese, and Aluminum. This spring is located relatively close to the part of the stream where metal concentrations began to spike. The hypothesis was not supported; load data water quality sampling and geologic back grounding showed the ephemeral and permanent springs as a source of contamination.

EATING MARS
Lianna Joy Spurrier
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

In this experiment, radishes were planted in Earth soil, plain JSC-Mars-1A (a Martian regolith simulant), and this simulant treated with BioChar to test the possibility of growing food for future Martian colonies using the present regolith. They were watered, measured, and recorded every day for 35 days. Overall, the average height was the tallest in the radishes grown in Earth soil, but plants in the plain JSC-Mars-1A showed the most development based on the number of leaves. The height of radishes in BioChar treated simulant was lower but more developed than Earth soil plants. A t-test on means, performed on all radish groups besides the ones grown without soil, showed that none of the height differences were statistically significant, leaving the leaf development as the best indicator of development. Because the most plants developed a second set of leaves in Martian simulant, regolith shows promise for future use in food production and may actually grow more productive plants than Earth soil.

ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS OF STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS ON THE STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF A TORNADIC VORTEX
Casey Richard Densmore
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

Tornadoes are some of nature’s most destructive forces and straight-line winds are common in severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the changes that occurred with the funnel structure as straight-line winds are directed into a vortex. The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that straight-line winds added to a simulated tornado’s environment will alter the structure and stability of the tornadic vortex. A replicate set of experiments was conducted at each of three baseline funnel structures. Variables tested were straight-line wind altitude, speed, and angle entering the funnel. A scale of 0-5 was used to describe tornado structure, which was measured for each trial. Ten replicates were conducted for each set of experimental parameters, for a total of 400 replicates. Statistical analysis was conducted using a One-Way ANOVA with p < 0.05. Based on the experiment, the hypothesis was proven correct. Straight-line winds and their components did have an impact on the structure of the tornadic vorticies. Impacts of the straight-line winds varied with the baseline funnel structure (vortex strength), and the most significant impact of any of the variables tested was noted with a change in the straight-line wind angle. For the two strongest baseline funnel structures, winds aimed in the direction of the funnel maintained or strengthened the overall funnel, while winds aimed against the direction of rotation tended to weaken the funnel structure. In some cases, with the weakest baseline funnel structure, the winds reversed the direction of rotation. The tornado simulator used in this experiment successfully demonstrated the importance of the straight-line winds to the structure of a tornadic vortex.

REHABILITATING HYDROPHOBIC SOIL TO ALLOW INDIGENOUS BUNCH GRASS GROWTH
Hannah Jeanine Washburn
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The objectives of my project are to determine if treating hydrophobic soil with an alkaline solution or an Aqua Gro L solution will speed the rehabilitation process and help allow native bunch grass growth. It is my goal to help the soil get back to its non-hydrophobic state. To make hydrophobic soil I collected coarse, upland soil and covered it with dried leaves and wood. With supervision, I burned the organic material for 8 hours and let it cool. I then did a WDPT test to determine hydrophobicity. I had 4 test soils: untreated soil, hydrophobic soil, hydrophobic soil treated with an alkaline solution, and hydrophobic soil treated with an Aqua Gro L solution. I saturated 12 cups of hydrophobic soil with the alkaline solution and another 12 cups with the Aqua Gro L solution and allowed them to dry. In the bottom of an 8x11 aluminum pan I spread 1 inch of untreated soil, covered this with a 1 inch layer of test soil followed by another 1 inch layer of untreated soil. Next, I spread ¼ cup grass seed and covered this with ¼ inch untreated soil. I then watered the trays, watched, and documented the grass growth. After 2 weeks I pulled 10 plugs from each test tray, rinsed soil away from the root system then weighed and measured the grass/root plugs. I had a total of 4 growing trays and 40 grass/root plugs. The results of testing were that the untreated soil grass/root plugs had an average weight of 8.1 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 7.8cm. The hydrophobic soil grass/root plugs had an average weight of 6 grams after soil rinse and average root ball of 4.8cm. The hydrophobic soil with alkaline solution grass/root plugs had an average weight of 1.05 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 1.5 cm. The hydrophobic soil with the Aqua Gro L solution grass/root plugs had an average weight of 10.2 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 8.8cm. As a hydrophobic soil rehabilitator, Aqua Gro L has the most potential to allow water percolation and promote plant growth with a strong, penetrating root system. This could be a possible solution to the problem of erosion and mud slides of denuded hillsides due to fire. While the occasional fire is considered to be healthy for an ecosystem, hydrophobic soil is not. It can paralyze an ecosystem and be financially devastating due to loss of top soil from excessive erosion and mudslides.

IGNORED MICRO SEASHELLS TELL ANCIENT MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Gyou Tanaka
Chiba High School, Chiba, JAPAN

Macro-sized fossil shells have often been used for environmental reconstruction of marine formations. However, they tend to be transported without significant damage, thus they are not always a good indicator of paleoenvironment. Small-sized shells can be a good indicator of paleoenvironment because they are easily abraded or broken in a short period. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the Yabu Formation (approx. 300 thousand years ago) in Semata, Japan based on the small-sized shells.<br><br> The surveyed outcrop is located at about 40 km ESE of Tokyo. Sediment samples were collected from 9 horizons, and then washed in water to remove mud contents. Sand grains and small fossils of the size range 0.5 mm to 4.0 mm were sieved, and small mollusk shells were picked up under binocular microscope. Identification of the shells was made with reference monographs and suggestions from museum specialists. Degrees of shell preservations were recorded by the four grades (A to D).<br><br> Out of 1135 individuals picked up from the sediments, 982 small-sized molluscs, consisting of 38 species were identified. Well-preserved shells mostly consist of shallow-marine species living in subtidal to 20-30 m deep. Shells from intertidal zone tend to be poorly preserved (ranks D and C are dominant).<br><br> Paleodepth of the outcrop in Semata is estimated as 10-30 m deep based on the modern ecology of molluscan species. Small-sized shells can be an excellent indicator of paleoenvironment in the future studies.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF SEA LEVEL RISE ON HURRICANE-INDUCED FLOODING AND INUNDATION IN THE NORTHERN GULF COAST
Taide Ding
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

NOAA estimates mean sea level rise in the hurricane-prone northern Gulf of Mexico at nearly 1-cm per year, the fastest rate along any U.S. coastline. This makes it inevitable that extreme events such as hurricanes would cause even greater flooding and inundation of coastal regions in the future, posing dire threats to coastal infrastructure. Due to the dominance of multiscale hydrodynamic processes driven by storms, tides, and waves in coastal and estuarine zones, numerical simulation remains the optimum method to obtain geographically detailed assessments of local inundation. Thus, using an integrated cyclonic wind and storm-surge model developed in the previous year and verified through hindcasts of Hurricane Gustav (2008) and real-time predictions of Hurricane Isaac (2012), design storm simulations based on Gustav were conducted for progressive scenarios of future sea level rise (from +0.5-m to +2-m) and climate change-induced hurricane intensification (central pressure decrease) in the northern Gulf Coast. Numerically simulated local water levels were compared with NOAA’s tidal gauge data as well as simplified analytical estimates. Simulations showed that, at locations with open and relatively smooth shorelines, sea level rise and hurricane intensification both correlate linearly with storm-surge and inundation increase. However, locations with more complex coastal geometries (e.g. enclosed by a bay) showed strong nonlinear correlations, with flood level changes often amplified compared to those on an open coast, making numerical simulations crucial in accurately estimating local flood hazards. Assessments of sea level rise like these can provide valuable information for planning long-term coastal infrastructure such as levees, bridges, and industrial complexes.

A REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF HUMAN CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS ON GLOBAL TEMPERATURE
Katherine Marie Webb
Tabb High School, Yorktown, VA

The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of a revised estimate of “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS), the equilibrium warming associated with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere, on projections of global equilibrium temperature. The revision in ECS changed the mean estimated value from 3.3 to 2.2 degrees Celsius. <br><br> <br><br>To accomplish this, the work developed a systems dynamics model of the earth’s carbon cycle. Human CO2 emissions served as the independent variable (with four levels selected from emission scenarios commonly used by the scientific community) and the change in global equilibrium temperature served as the dependent variable. The model aggregated CO2 concentrations over a simulated period of 110 years and computed the resulting changes in global equilibrium temperature for the old and new estimate distributions of ECS.<br><br>With 2500 trials for each emission level, the model generated CO2 concentration levels for the year 2100 within the range of previously published estimates and calculated the resulting global mean equilibrium temperature to within 4% of the expected temperatures. The results using the new value of ECS were all 1-2 degrees Celsius lower than estimates using the old value. <br><br> <br><br>The study concluded that past projections of equilibrium global temperature for any level of CO2 emissions are likely overestimated by 50% (1-2 degrees Celsius). Additionally, past extreme estimates of 6-10 degree Celsius increases are extremely unlikely (with probability less than .000001). These new estimates should be considered by policy makers as they shape societal responses to global warming.

USING MODIFIED NATURAL ZEOLITE TO IMPROVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SOIL
Amr Faisal Jarajreh, Dana Shalabi
Jubilee School, Amman, JORDAN

The basicity and high saline content of soil is a conflict in the agricultural field; since basic soil that is saturated with (K+, Na+, Mg, Ca+) has different chemical and physical characteristics than standard soil, which causes ammonium volatilization, increasing salinization and reducing the fertility of the soil. This study endeavors to improve the calcareous soil characteristics by reducing its saturation and the saline content to improve its fertility using modified Zeolite. The Zeolite raw material used in this study was modified by increasing its H+ content (more acidic) to reduce the basicity of soil upon mixing . At the same time, modified Zeolite was capable through ion exchange to reduce the salinity of the soil. This was conducted by monitoring the pH of the acid where the Zeolite was soaked in for different times. The filtrate pH of the modified Zeolite was 8.28 which suggested 2 diverged options: Either the Zeolite was completely destroyed from the highly acidic medium, or the modification process was successfully completed. Thus; the (XRD) was used to observe the crystal structure for the Zeolite substance. XRD results confirmed that Zeolite maintained its crystalline structure. Moreover; the modified Zeolite sample was applied on a selective soil using various concentrations to examine whether treated soil with modified Zeolite improved the characteristics of the soil. The results showed the base saturation of the sample decreased from 2.07 to 1.89. In conclusion; this modified natural Zeolite succeeded to reduce base saturation and salinization to treat the fertility of soil.

CAUSES OF OFFSHORE RAIN BANDS ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF TAIWAN
I-Tzu Chen, Yu-Sy Lin
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

Better understanding of weather systems occurring off the northeastern coast of Taiwan is crucial to the safety of domestic flights from Hualien County to Taipei City because this region comes across the flight path. It is not uncommon to observe the occurrence of offshore rain bands in this region, and however, their formation and characteristics have been poorly understood. The objective of this study is to identify the possible meteorological factors conducive to the formation of rain bands and to understand the characteristics of the rain bands. Based on the preliminary analysis of the radar images and other data sources provided from Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan, rain bands tended to be formed more frequently at night and in winter, approximately 20 to 50 kilometers offshore. The result shows that the formation of rain bands was related to topographically induced wind convergence at low levels and temperature differences between sea water and relatively cool atmospheric air. In addition, a detailed case study was also conducted to illustrate how rain bands are formed offshore. These analyses further support the importance of temperature difference and the interactions between the environmental flow and coastal topography on the formation and subsequent development of the rain bands.

DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM- NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR LUNG CANCER USING VOCS

Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate in America. This is especially true for women, with 60-80% of diagnoses being made in stage 4, in which the 5-year survival rate is only 10%. The only truly effective diagnostic tools at this time are high resolution CT scans and good histories and physicals which, currently, have not improved early diagnosis of Lung Cancer or mortality rate. Therefore the only way to decrease mortality rate is to find an early-stage diagnostic tool for lung cancer. My research has led me to Dictyostelium Discoideum, more commonly known as Slime Mold. Slime Mold is a unique protest that has the ability to use Chemotaxis to maneuver to a food source. During my research, I also learned that dogs detected lung cancer in the breaths of patients by sensing a VOC, or Volatile Organic Compound. I therefore came up with the idea of combining the two by utilizing the VOC to ascertain the effect on the slime mold growth towards a food source. The interference with slime mold’s directional growth was quantifiable. All 4 of the Single Blind Studies showed the same results, proving the inhibitory effect of lung cancer breath samples on slime mold growth. With a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 78%, and a two tailed P Value of less than .0001, my study showed that Dictyostelium Discoideum is an inexpensive, safe, and very efficient early-stage diagnostic tool for lung cancer.
