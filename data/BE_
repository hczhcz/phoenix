BEHAVIORAL STUDY: THE NEGATIVE CONDITIONING OF ENABLED CURLY-O DROSOPHILA
Laura Kathryn Lamar
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, Florida, USA

This project is the result of several behavioral tests on Enabled Curly-O Drosophila. These tests were conducted to determine if negative conditioning could influence a fruit fly's choice of a substance.<br><br>For these experiments several clear vials were attached together to form a "T" model. The fly was placed in the base of the "T" and walked up to the top and chose side A, which had one substance, or side B, which had a different substance. The model design made it possible to clearly see which side the fly chose.<br><br>The fruit fly's choice was observed by three sets of substance tests. The test substances were the fly's food, mustard, banana, and Caesar dressing. The favorite substances were found by the average number of times that the fly chose one substance over another. The fly's food ended up being the favorite substance.<br><br>Negative conditioning was then tested after the two final substances were found. When the fly approached its food, a series of taps would knock the fly around until it turned to the opposite direction and went to the banana. This was repeated until the fly finally went straight to the banana ignoring the food.<br><br>These tests have suggested that a fruit fly will focus on a new substance as a reaction to very mild negative conditioning in addition to harsh treatments. It also suggests that scientists studying fruit flies should be cautious when handling flies since this experiment shows that negative conditioning can influence fly behavior. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF CURVED AND SHARPLY ANGLED TURNS ON A MOUSE’S (MUS MUSCULUS) ABILITY TO COMPLETE MAZE.
Jonathan David Stanley
Clay High School, Green Cove Springs, Florida, United States of America

<br><br>The purpose of this project is to determine whether mice learn quicker in a maze with smooth curves or in a maze with sharp angles if both mazes have the same pattern.<br><br>The procedure for this experiment begins by obtaining the materials and constructing three mazes. Two mazes should have the same pattern and length. The control maze should have a straight path and be the same length as the direct route of the other two.<br><br>To begin the experiment, place the bait at the finish point of the maze. Place one mouse at a time in the maze and allow it to finish before entering the next mouse. Record the times of each mouse from the time they start to the time they finish the maze. Repeat the above steps until all five mice have completed the maze. Repeat this process each day, at the same time of day, until each mouse has run each of the three mazes five times.<br><br>The average run time for the mice to complete each of the mazes was calculated in seconds as: Angle Maze - 202.32; Control Maze - 20.68; Curve Maze - 115. The average time that the mice improved in each maze was calculated in seconds as: Angle Maze - 200; Control Maze – 4.2; Curve Maze - 47.<br><br>The hypothesis was incorrect. The mice recorded a higher average rate of improvement in the angle maze than they did in the curve maze. The mice recorded average approximate run times of 202 and 115 seconds in the angle maze and curve mazes respectively. Though the mice can run the curve maze quicker, it is easier for them to learn the angle maze.<br><br>

HSDQ- A DECADE ADDED TO LIFE
Elizabeth Fairchild Harding
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL 32803 USA

Currently in the USA, two-million people are diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) yearly. However, 30-million individuals (estimated) are undiagnosed with SDB yearly. Failure to diagnose leads to significant conditions, such as heart-failure, lung-damage, hypertension, strokes, and heart-rhythm disorders. Also, SDB lowers life expectancy by ten years (estimated). Additionally, the US National Commissions determined that SDB was a factor in half of all traffic-accidents and 36% of all fatal traffic-accidents yearly. <br><br> Doctors desperately need an efficient yet accurate way of identifying SDB. For diagnosis, “The Berlin Questionnaire” (BLQ) was created. The test demonstrated 85% of patients tested had SDB. However, BLQ is cumbersome for the practitioner to give, thus causing many not to administer it. The researcher believed that BLQ could be simplified, hence promoting the researcher’s goal of having all patients screened for SDB. <br><br> This study demonstrated the comparable reliability of a four-question survey, “The Harding Sleep Disordered Questionnaire” (HSDQ), developed by the researcher. The physicians at Sand Lake administered BLQ and HSDQ to patients, who subsequently received overnight sleep-studies. Correlations between the study/questionnaires were compared. <br><br> BLQ and HSDQ were equal in effectiveness, but HSDQ was significantly more efficient. After the researcher screened 250 patients with BLQ and HSDQ, both tests proved 99% accurate. However, BLQ averaged 10.64 minutes to complete, whereas HSDQ averaged 32 seconds. Because HSDQ is accurate/efficient, it will hopefully gain widespread acceptance in the medical community, thus allowing every patient to be screened for SBD. HSDQ acceptance would therefore decrease mortality and morbidity. <br><br>

ARE PEDIATRIC GUIDELINES ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF COST?
Neha Prabhu Bhoomreddy
William Mason High School, Mason, OH, USA

Are Pediatric Guidelines Addressing the Issue of Cost?<br><br> This observational study was done to determine whether the developers of pediatric guidelines address the economic aspects of an intervention in the guidelines that they publish. 285 guidelines were obtained from a web site between January 1995 and December 2001. They were read and evaluated to see if and how much each individual guideline addressed the issue of cost. <br><br> While reading each guideline, any word or phrase that dealt with cost was highlighted in red, underlined, and made bold on the computer. Then, that sentence was copied and recorded in a word document called “Evidence of Cost.” Finally, after counting the number of sentences that addressed cost from each guideline, the data was recorded in an excel spreadsheet called “New Data Collection Form.” <br><br> Out of 285 guidelines, 177 of them were found to have addressed the issue of cost somewhere in the guideline. These 177 guideline were further distributed and classified into different categories that showed the depth that each guideline went into while addressing cost. This project attests that only 62.1% of the guidelines addressed economic aspects of an intervention in some way, many of them stating just a phrase or a sentence at the most, showing that the guidelines still needs to create more awareness about health care costs in their publications. <br><br>

HUMAN PERCEPTION OF IMAGE MANIPULATION--ORIGINAL VS. REAL
John David Hays, Wilcox- Hildreth Public schools 404 E. Sapp St. Wilcox, NE, 68982 
USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if human perception could detect the difference between a computer manipulated image and the original image.<br><br>I selected 15 digital photos and put them into an Adobe Photoshop program. With each of the selected 15 photos, I subtracted images or I added images using images that I obtained from additional photos. This can be done with a working knowledge of digital equipment and image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop.<br><br>I ended up with 30 photos total. 15 photos had the original image and 15 photos were computer manipulated images. The photos were paired up so that they could be compared.<br><br>Volunteers were told the purpose of the project and were asked to complete a survey. They were told that they would be shown 15 sets of pictures, one that was the original and one that had been manipulated in some way. The volunteers were asked to complete the survey by telling which photo was the original picture and what was different in the photos. After the surveying was done, the data was collected and analyzed.<br><br>The results do not support my original hypothesis that more than 50% of people will not be able to tell if a photo has been computer manipulated and will therefore state that the manipulated image is the original image.<br><br>The results of this study lead to the conclusion that ordinary people can perceive the difference between the computer manipulated image and the original. <br><br>

A LOOK AT YOUTH IN TROUBLE: USING SIMPLE ETHICS TO DETECT POTENTIALLY TROUBLED TEENS
Alicia Lynn McDermott
Grace Fellowship Christian School, Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, USA

This project investigates the ethical decisions of teenagers attending high school and compares them with incarcerated teens. Using simple moral dilemmas, the test created by the student researcher could be used for early detection of potentially troubled teens. Other variables such as age, race, gender, influences, and number of parents were also included to evaluate how these factors affect the moral attitudes of youth. Subjects were given a validated survey of twenty moral dilemmas, with three possible solutions- “Subjective”, “Judgmental”, or “Caring”. The subjects chose one way to solve each. “Caring” answers were more “moralistic”, the opposite of “Subjective”. It was hypothesized high school teens would answer with a highly “Caring” perspective, while incarcerated teens would have a “Subjective” perspective. Also predicted was that subjects who lived with two parents and who were greatly influenced by their mother, father, or both parents would have a more “Caring” viewpoint than those who considered their friends or siblings as their greatest influence. The completed tests were divided into “High School Students” and “Juvenile Delinquents”. The answers were then collated by subject and subdivided into the three possible categories. Discriminate analysis showed that this instrument could provide an accurate prediction of “troubled” teens a majority of the time. Oneway ANOVA showed significant variation between "Caring" and "Subjective" answers for those teens whose greatest influence was either the Mother or Both parents, as opposed to Friends. Results indicate an instrument like this, after refinement, might be used to provide early identification of troubled youth.

MATH MADE FUN!
Kellyn Jo Wilkinson
Monte Vista High School, Monte Vista, CO, United States

The purpose of this project was to evaluate small group activities for problem solving as a method to improve individual problem solving skills.<br><br> It is believed that the more language children use in problem solving, the more methods they will use. The more methods the student uses the better his/her understanding. By allowing students to work together and learn from each other, they will be better prepared to work the problems on their own.<br><br> Two separate classes were used, one with twelve students and one with sixteen. Each of these students were given an individual assessment. Half of the students from each class were involved in group activities. After meeting with the groups six times, students were given another individual assessment to determine any progress. This process was repeated until the students had taken five assessments. The group activities as well as the assessments were coordinated with what they were learning in class at that time and were approved by the teachers involved.<br><br> The results show that group activities do improve the individual problem solving skills of first grade students. The variable groups were able to explain their methods, use more mathematical language, and solve the problems in various ways. A t-test showed that Class 1 was statistically valid at a level of alpha .05. Class 2 showed significance at alpha .001. When the groups were combined, the results were reaffirmed by significance shown at alpha .001.

THE STIMULI EFFECT: HEARING AND REACTION TIMES
Chetan Bhasker Jhaveri
La Plata High School, La Plata, MD, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine whether the ear(s) in which a stimulus is administered effects reaction times to that stimulus. Previous studies using dichotic-testing methods have suggested that there is a strong Right-Ear-Advantage for right-handed subjects, but this has been refuted by recent studies that show a decreased Crossed-Uncrossed-Difference for auditory stimuli. My project was meant to verify whether the Right-Ear-Advantage in reaction times could be verified using a simple reaction time method. I carried out my project by gathering 50 healthy, consenting, right handed test-subjects for experimentation. All reaction times were measured using a yardstick dropped simultaneously with the administration of a stimulus, with the number of milliseconds passing between the time the ruler was dropped to its being caught serving as a measure of reaction times. After obtaining a control, I entered a pre-prepared tape into a tape player with independent volume control headphones. On this tape, I recorded the stimulus "go" 9 times, with the stimulus being administered 3 times each into the left, right and both ears. After experimentation, the data showed that there was a distinct average 24 millisecond Left-Ear-Advantage (4.75%) among my subjects in simple reaction times. Paired sample T-tests and regression analysis corroborated these findings. The LEA that I found was unexpected but is consistent with the belief that the auditory pathway has strong bilateral access to the cerebral hemispheres. This finding may prove important for future devices, such as earphones for pilots, which seek to prompt optimal reaction times.

MARKETING FACTORS RELATING TO CONSUMERS' NATURAL TENDANCIES
Jessica Ann Borgen
Lake Park Audubon High School, Lake Park, Minnesota 

This study dealt with the marketing strategies used by grocery stores and supermarkets. I will determine what, if any, strategies are employed by grocery stores to maximize customer satisfaction and to promote sales. The goal of this project is to create an "ideal" grocery store. It will be formed from a meld of actual grocery store layouts and survey results. Incorporated will also be factors such as color scheme and music played. To accomplish this, the layouts of actual grocery stores were obtained and surveys were administered to a select age group of 12-19 year olds and asked them to arrange the ten most common departments of a store as they chose. The data from both tests were combined on a large piece of tag board to show the trneds and similarities. The section with the most of a particular department was classified as such. Also, color schemes and music chosen by stores were noted. The combination of this data was used to create an "ideal" store layout and setting to maximize customer satisfaction and promote sales. The majority of participants arranged the departments in a similar fashion to the typcial layout of actual grocery stores. The color schemes chosen were warming and/or calming which promotes sales and a comfortable setting. The observation determined the type, quality, and frequency of certain behaviors in randomly selected consumers.

WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
Carson Alan Baughman
White Pine High School, Ely, Nevada, USA

The Shooting Gallery Archeological Site exists within a small basin west of the town of Alamo, Nevada, along highway 93. The site consists of petroglyphs, stone tools, hunting blinds and most interesting of all, rows of elongated rocks that have been stood on end along several ridge tops. It is not clear as to how these "pillars" were used. This led me to attempt to explain the site and how it was used through archeological inference.<br><br> An attempt to determine the use of the site was made in 5 major steps. First, I thoroughly explored the site on foot. While exploring, I plotted all important artifacts that I found. I then downloaded all the data that had been collected using the GPS units into a computer program called Arcview. Using this data I generated a large topographic map indicating all the artifacts I found. I then conducted background research using a number of books, articles and a personal interview. Using a process known as archeological inference I looked for commonalties between the Shooting Gallery site and sites that had previously been studied.<br><br> The exact position of 188 pillars, 21 hunting blinds, 3 sets of metates, 4 lithic scatters (stone flakes, signs of tool making), 3 rock piles and 18 petroglyph panels were recorded. After analyzing this data in conjunction with my literature search, I deduced that the site had been used for hunting, Pinyon nut harvesting and seasonal living. I was also able to conclude that the users of the site were most likely indigenous populations of Southern Paiute, Western Shoshone or of a Fremont contemporary.<br><br>

MEDIA MAYHEM: THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTION AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF TELEVISION ON CHILDREN
Natalie Rose Mergler
Chaminade-Julienne Catholic High School, Dayton OH, United States of America

The overall goal of this year's project is to provide insight into the physiological response to television and to determine whether all forms of TV affect children equally or whether it is only violent forms of TV that effect them. The hypotheses are: 1. Children will experience raised cortisol levels after viewing TV and these level will remain raised longer than the normal duration of cortisol. 2. The data after one month of controlled television diets will suggest that a reduction in total TV hours is more effective than a reduction in violent programming. The students were initially shown a TV sample and saliva samples were obtained before, immediately following and 90 minutes after the test to analyze the curve at which the cortisol diminishes. The students were monitored for one month in which some were instructed to have the same TV habits, others limited total TV time and others limited violent TV shows but maintained the same total television hours. The test was repeated and saliva samples were obtained as described above. An immunoblot assay was used to trace cortisol. A program was compiled to analyze pixels of digital pictures of samples. This data suggested an abnormal curve in cortisol caused by television based on t-tests and logarithmic regression analysis. Cortisol levels elevated for abnormal periods lead to functional lesions in the brain, which first affect the frontal lobes of the brain which control aggressive and impulsive behavior. Data also suggests that a reduction in total television hours (logarithmic regression results in r2=0.8 to the theoretical) not simply a reduction in violent programming (logarithmic regression results in r2=0.2 to the theoretical) is more effective. Thus is can be suggested that all forms of television potentially result in abnormal cortical curves.

THE PREVALENCE OF SLEEP COMPLAINTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Julianne Marie Susman
John Jay High School, Katonah NY, USA

Although the prevalence of sleep disorders is well established in the adult population, fewer studies have been conducted with adolescents. Changes in circadian rhythms, busy schedules, earlier school start times, increased social and school work demands as well as other factors may predispose adolescents to poor sleep habits. In addition, there may be underlying symptoms of sleep disorders that may further contribute to poor sleep habits. This study was designed to determine whether otherwise healthy middle school and high school students report symptoms of common sleep disorders. The study was conducted through a survey, based on a web-based survey found at www.sleepforscience.org. After IRB approval was obtained, copies of the survey, and informational letter, and a mental health resource sheet was mailed to the parents of 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th grade students enrolled at a medium-sized suburban high school. Surveys were returned anonynously, and data was entered into spreadsheets and analyzed using SAS (Chi square tests). The older children reported less refreshing sleep and complained more often of symptoms of insomnia and snoring. There was a trend more girls to often report more symptoms of insomnia. The results of the survey are consisten with the literature on short and unrefreshing sleep endorsed by adolescents. In addition, the survey suggests there may be other factors impacting sleep that may contribute to daytime sleepiness. It may be important for health professionals to probe into other possible sleep complaints when teens present with sleep delays.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC ON SHORT-TERM MEMORY
Douglas Joseph Christman, McKinley Junior High School
Saint Albans, WV, United States of America 

The purpose of my experiment was to see if any type of music would provide a better studying environment opposed to silence. I also wanted to see which music type would give the worst results.<br><br> My procedure was as follows: Take one person to the library or a back room that is quiet. Inform them of the procedures they will be going through. Next, play the first song while showing the first set of pictures. After one minute, stop the music and hide the pictures and give the person one minute to right down as many as he/she can remember. Afterwards, have them stare at a blank sheet of paper for one minute to clear their mind. Repeat all steps using different sets of pictures and different music each time.<br><br> The data taken during this experiment showed that classical music was best for middle aged adults and silence was best for teenagers of both genders.<br><br> After doing this experiment, I have concluded that studying efficiency would be at its peak if no music or classical was on and the least efficienct would be at its lowest if rap music would be played. A student or teacher could use the results of this experiment to find the best environment for studying and inproving their grades.

ABSOLUTE VS. RELATIVE PITCH: IT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS! OR IS IT TO MY MIND?
Sita Chandrika Palepu
James Madison High School, Vienna, VA, United States of America

Possessors of Absolute Pitch, “APers,” and Relative Pitch, “RPers,” differ in how they perceive music. This project’s purpose was to uncover what these differences were and the cognitive reasoning behind them.<br><br> The experiment consisted of three computerized tasks, programmed in visual basic (back-end) and Matlab (front-end). Two tones were played in each task, and the subject was asked to determine the musical interval. The inter-stimulus-interval, “ISI,” (time gap between two tones) was varied in the three tasks: 300 ms, 5 seconds, and 100 ms, respectively. Subjects were also asked to identify mistuning.<br><br> APers did significantly better than RPers in accurately perceiving the musical interval in tasks 1 and 2. Conversely, the RPers were more accurate in task 3. Also, RPers were more sensitive to mistuning.<br><br> Using the empirical evidence, a theoretical model of the “neural pathway of perception” was developed. It was concluded that memory attenuation detrimentally affects RPers, but not APers, as they can extract values for each tone from their linguistically coded AP template in their long-term memory. Short ISIs force APers to switch to their ill-formed RP template, explaining their poor performance in task 3. AP possessors perform a broad category search rather than a discrimination search, thus diminishing their ability to identify minor mistuning.<br><br> The cohesive theory and model of music perception for AP and RP possessors lays a foundation for further applications in the development of a unified theory of music and language perception/acquisition, and contributes to the long-term/short-term memory and nature/nurture studies and debates. <br><br>

IDENTIFICATION OF ABSOLUTE PITCH POSSESSORS WITHOUT THE BIAS OF MUSICAL TRAINING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCREENING PROCEDURE THAT DISCERNS BETWEEN TONES
Priya Ashoke Rajdev
Ossining High School, 29 South Highland Ave, Ossining, NY 10562, USA

The current definition for the specialized skill Absolute Pitch (AP) finds a middle ground between the dispute over the learned versus the innate nature of the skill: AP is the ability to (1) internalize or remember a tone, and discern differences between two tones, and (2) the ability to apply a label to this internalization. This two-fold description vastly broadens the population size of those who exhibit AP-qualities. However, the usage of procedures that test for AP via pitch labeling tasks excludes a portion of the population without substantial musical background. The first test was based on existing musical procedures by classifying individual notes by name in the western music scale. The other three tests were based on tone internalization and comparison, via self-referencing. The results for each test were compared. There was a significant difference between test 1 and tests 2, 3, and 4 (p<.001). Based on tests 2, 3, and 4, two groups were separated from the sample. One group compared self-identified AP and relative pitch possessors (RP) with AP and RP possessors identified by tests 2, 3, and 4. The other group represented the similar performance of subjects without significant musical experience.

DEVELOPING A TOOL TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED NEUROBLASTOMA UNDERGOING EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY
Andrew Russell Pickett
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, USA

This study developed and validated an assessment tool that can evaluate the quality of life of patients with neuroblastoma undergoing experimental therapy. Participants consisted of a simple random sample of eighty-one pediatric oncology healthcare providers. Each was given a preliminary instrument and instructed to answer the questions from the perspective of a patient. Following completion of the survey, a semi-structured interview was scheduled with half of the participants to gain input from their professional opinion. <br><br> To validate the tool both a quantitative and qualitative method was used. To test for necessary item reduction, percent response was calculated for each question and those that did not receive a twenty-five percent or greater consensus were removed. A Chronbach Alpha Test was performed on the survey to test for internal consistency and reliability. The survey was divided into four subcategories for correlation analyses.. A standardized item alpha greater than .60 was necessary to label a group a reliable scale. All but one group achieved a high r-value, therefore confirming internal consistency and reliability of the tool. Item addition was necessary in the group that did not pass the test. The qualitative analysis confirmed the need for item addition in this group and identified what subjects should be added. After undergoing item reduction/addition and a Chronbach Alpha Test for internal consistency and reliability the tool is confirmed valid. <br><br> This tool can be used to provide healthcare professionals and patients with more information on the effects of experimental therapy on quality of life enabling them to make an informed decision on participation.<br><br>

EPILEPSY IMPACT: SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC STUDY OF SELF-PERCEPTION, PSYCHOSOCIAL CHA- RACTERISTICS, AND LIMITATIONS OF PATIENTS WITH INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY (PURE HISPAN
Alfredo Andrés Medina, Academia del Perpetuo Socorro 
704 Martí St. San Juan, Puerto Rico 00907

The purpose of this investigation is to contribute knowledge to provide further understanding of the psychosocial characteristics of the patients with intractable epilepsy and to improve their social integration. In Latin America, particularly in Puerto Rico, no studies have been conducted regarding the impact of self-perception, psychosocial characteristics and individual limitations on patients with intractable epilepsy. In the socio-demographic aspect, it was hypothesized that epilepsy patients will predominantly male, university attendees, of high unemployment, and a tendency to remain single. It was hypothesized that epilepsy will affect the patient in their daily activities, social relations, psychological profile, behavior, and functional limitations. A template was designed using the medical pre-evaluation document and the medical questionnaire. Data was collected by designated supervisor and recorded by investigator. The variables were measured and analyzed. Chi-square analysis was used to study an association between variables of interest. Socio-demographically, female predominated in a ratio of M:F 1:1.5, high school was the predominant educational level, and the majority of patients were single and student. Patients reported an average social satisfaction and intellectual capacity. Most patients do not disclose their condition. Additionally, they reported psychological constraints, difficulties in memory, and sleep disturbances. Patients have limitations that they do not perceive: overprotective families, limited educational, financial, and recreational opportunities. Patients reported they are unsatisfied with their crisis control. Epilepsy is a medical diagnosis but also a social label. This leads people with epilepsy to perceive a lack of social support, thus causing a more unfavorable quality of life.

THE CREMATION PROCESS
Pedro David Gil de Rubio
Colegio San José, Río Piedras, P.R.

The objective of this investigation is to inquire into people's knowledge about cremation, so people can make the right decisions. It was taken into consideration that cremation can substitute the burial. There is ignorance among persons about cremation. To orientate the people, a crematory was visited to observe the process. A sample of 100 persons (over 18 years) in Puerto Rico was taken. A questionnaire was given to inquire how much people knew about cremation. Resulting in a 0% of perfect knowledge, 26% of average knowledge, 63% of little knowledge, and 11% no knowledge. People did not know what happened in a crematory. They were also instructed on the process to increase their knowledge.

THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL TRAUMA ON PERSONALITY
Zarabeth Lehr Golden
Blanche Ely, Pompano Beach, Fl, USA

Personality characteristics after trauma plays a major role in determining how an individual recovers from a traumatic event. Personality may be affected by a person’s emotional reaction to trauma, reactions to problems caused by trauma, or neurological alterations that change personality. The current study attempted to identify the effects of physical and neurological changes on personality in a 2 x 2 multivariate design, controlling for emotional trauma. The study employed 419 subjects selected from clinical and research archives. The dependent variables were 13 scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 (MMPI-2). The results of a 2 (Physical) by 2 (Neurological) MANCOVA revealed significant effects for Physical, Neurological, and their interaction. As a consequence, post-hoc univariate ANCOVAs were conducted for each factor and their interaction across each MMPI-2 scale. The results of post-hoc ANCOVAs for the Physical variable indicated that 7 of the 13 variables showed significant differences (p<. 01), while there were only 2 significant differences for the Neurological variable and 3 significant interactions. Although both main variables were significant, the physical variable had a much stronger impact on personality than the neurological variable. The mean scores of the neurological group fell into the same abnormal range found in other studies, however those studies did not control for the effects of emotional and physical trauma. The results support the conclusion that it is not the neurological injury itself that affects personality but the individual’s ability to adapt to the symptoms and problems caused by a traumatic event.

THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEXICAL PROCESSING: AN EXAMINATION OF A MODEL OF THE COMPARISON PROCESS
Megan Chaya Gross
Hunter College High School, New York, NY, USA

This study examined the neurobiology of lexical processing in working memory. Adult participants were presented with a series of word pairs and asked to determine whether the words in each pair were the same or different. There were six types of word pairs: identical real words, identical non-words, real words differing in onset, non-words differing in onset, real words differing in coda, and non-words differing in coda. This study of the working memory comparison process provided a model of what may happen in lexical access during comprehension. The latencies and shape of waveforms in event-related brain potentials permitted a detailed examination of the timing of the process. The phonological negativity, a portion of the waveform that indicates the point at which the brain detects a difference between words, was present in all differing pair classes. There were no significant differences in amplitude. No significant differences were found between the peak latencies of the phonological negativity for real word pairs and non-word pairs. The phonological negativity occurred nearly 200 ms earlier for word pairs differing in the first sound than for word pairs differing in the final sound, which suggested that the comparison is performed linearly across the word representations and is concluded once words begin to differ phonologically.

IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN LEFT HANDED AND READING DISABILITIES?
Jenna Rae Parisien
Turtle Mt. Community High School Box 440 Belcourt, ND 58316

Learning disabilities especially reading disabilities have been around for centuries, but it wasn't until the 1960's that researchers started to identify them. Many studies have shown that we need to provide alternative methods to help people with disabilities learn to read in order to ensure a more productive population. Methods currently being used are helping a few, but haven't been proven to be very effective.<br><br> In my project, I wanted to find out if there was a correlation between left handed people and having an increase in reading disabilities. If this is the case, finding methods to help people with reading disabilities may have something to do with left and right brain people.<br><br> To gather the information for my project, I contacted several schools and asked them for their numbers of students with reading disabilities and whether they were right or left handed. I also found out the numbers of males and females. I found that there was no increase amount of left handed people with reading disabilities compared to the normal population, but I did find a significant number of males with learning disabilities compared to females. In the results I collected, 69% of the individuals with reading disabilities were male. One issue that may need to be addressed in teaching people with reading disabilities is to use an approach that is more geared toward the differences between the way males and females learn to read.

EASTERN SHORE BIRD MONITORING TOOL DEVELOPMENT
Justin Alexander Hanacek
Thomas S. Wootton High School, Rockville, Maryland

At the height of the eastern shore migrations hundreds of thousands of birds use the National refuges for shelter and food. Assateague and Chincoteaque Islands are among the largest and most heavily used resting points for migrating fowl. These Islands are important for research with bird populations. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if a bird population to bird call ratio can be developed for terns by gathering both acoustic and visual data over a controlled area. This ratio would be useful because it could then be applied as a bird population assessment tool in the absence of visual verification. This is especially useful during night time monitoring. The hypothesis is that in the species of terns tested, every bird in a feeding area will produce an average of 10 calls over a 30 minute interval and a bird/call ratio of 1:10. This is because terns produce calls when feeding to communicate with other birds about where the food is.<br><br> The experiment uses a unique feature available in the Inlet separating Assateague National Seashore and Ocean City, Maryland. This site allows visual data to be collected at night due to parking lot lights near the feeding area. Bird calls were captured using an acoustic parabolic microphone. Data was gathered on five different nights of the season migration.<br><br> In this experiment, the collection of data from feeding terns and the establishment of a ratio was successful. However the hypothesis was wrong. The bird/call ratio was about 6:1. No statistical difference was found between actual bird counts and population predictions using this 6:1 call ratio. The data showed this ratio would accuratly estimate the total population of feeding terns in that area. With more research, this call ratio method may prove to be a useful tool for estimating tern populations. <br><br>

DO SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES AFFECT TEENS' DECISIONS?
Ashley Ann Gowgiel
Lakewood Ranch High School, Bradenton FL, United States of America

A reason for this project is to discover if teenagers are affected by audio and/or visual subliminal messages. After returning the signed permission forms, the subjects listened to a clip of Beethoven’s Sonata No. 26 in E-flat Major with a subliminal message of a shape, color, and number. The test subjects then chose a shape, color, and number from a list of three choices for each variable that I gave to them. They then watched a video clip in which the same variables applied for the subliminal message, and were once again asked to chose a shape, color, and number. The individual test subject data was tabulated and analyzed for percent of correct answers for each variable and percent of correct answers overall. <br><br>The manipulated variables in this experiment were the subliminal messages (Shape, color, and number). The responding variable was the choice of the test subject. <br><br>After completion of these tests 57% of the subjects tested correctly identified that there was a color in the first audio test, 42% identified that there was a shape in the second audio test, 25% of people identified that there was a number in the third audio test, and 15% identified that there was no subliminal message (control) in the last audio test. In the visual category, 45% identified color correctly, 37% answered shape correctly, 31% answered number correctly, and 22% answered the control clip correctly. <br><br>

HOW RELAXATION AFFECTS THE BODY AND MIND
David Randall Schulze
Tom C. Clark High School, San Antonio, TX USA

This project investigated the effects of relaxation on the body and mind. Relaxation was achieved by having the subjects enter a sensory deprivation tank of water and remain there for a short period of time. The tank measures 1.2192 X 1.2191 X 2.4384 meters and holds 0.90624 cubic meters of water. It holds 272.15544 kg of magnesium sulfate and it is located in a quiet area of the house. Thirty-six subjects were used for this project. <br><br>The sensory deprivation tank completely relaxes the body; consequently this allows for mental relaxation as well. Thirty-six subjects were divided into groups based on age, gender, and the amount of time spent in the tank. Subjects were administered a battery of tests measuring both physical and mental abilities. The tests were: SAT Math, SAT Language, Mental Processing Speed, Chimera Test of Mental Maturity, Content With Life, Blood Pressure, and Balance. Changes were noted and the results were statistically analyzed according to a T test.<br><br>The results indicated that young males received greater benefits and scored better on the post-test. These results show a significant statistical difference. The overall mental state of subjects after being in the tank had a T value equal to 2.603723676 whereas, the subjects that did not enter the tank only indicated a T value equal to -0.6883692642 in scores comparing the pretest to the post-test. This level of significance in the T test indicates that there is a positive difference in mental and physical abilities as a result of spending time in a sensory deprivation tank.

HOW DO PAY RAISES AFFECT MEASURED PERFORMANCE AND INFERRED MOTIVATION IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYERS?
Alex Oliver Kardon
South Side High School, Rockville Centre, New York, USA

Sports fans and members of the media constantly accuse players of becoming lazy and complacent after they have signed more lucrative contracts. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an actual correlation between signing a contract with a higher annual salary and declining performance in professional baseball. A possible effect of team success on individual performance was also examined. Adjusted OPS+ was used to measure performance and it was assumed that any decrease in intrinsic motivation would cause a decline in performance. Most previous studies have concluded that external rewards cause decreased intrinsic motivation, while others suggest the opposite. A third group of researchers have suggested that rewards have no significant effect on intrinsic motivation. Instead, they claim that the success or failure that prompts the presence or absence of the rewards causes any change in intrinsic motivation. This study showed that neither rewards nor team success has a significant direct effect on intrinsic motivation.

DEAF, NOT DUMB: DISPELLING THE MYTH OF A MATHEMATICS DEFICIT AMONG DEAF STUDENTS
Casey Ann Vaughn
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY, USA

Conventional wisdom holds that deaf students do not perform as well as hearing students on tasks involving mathematics. Recent scholars have wondered if the root problem lies in the percentage of word problems contained on typical standardized tests, but a link has never been empirically demonstrated. Correlations between hearing condition, reading comprehension and mathematical ability were examined among students in three NYS schools – two non-residential deaf schools and one public elementary school. The present study investigated the degree to which word problem score was influenced by reading comprehension score, sorting subjects by condition. Data analysis concluded that deaf children scored significantly lower on tasks involving reading comprehension and world problems, but scored comparably on tasks involving only simple arithmetic. It was therefore concluded that the so-called “mathematics deficit” in deaf children lies not in the area of symbolic mathematics, but rather in the reading comprehension difficulties which interfere with full understanding of word problems.

THE EFFECT OF STEREOTYPE THREAT ON HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' PERFORMANCE ON A MATH TEST
Sarah Elyse Waldman, 7 Pine Drive South, Roslyn, New York 11576
Roslyn High School, Roslyn, New York, USA

Stereotype threat is thought to occur when the fear of validating a negative stereotype leads members of the targeted group to inadvertently confirm the stereotype (Aronson, 1999; Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999). Two experiments were performed to investigate the impact of stereotype threat on high school girls’ math performance. In the first experiment, 102 high school students were asked to take an exam that resembled a shortened SAT I. The experimental manipulation took place in the first reading passage where participants were randomly exposed to one of four reading comprehension passages. In the three experimental groups, the passage pertained to gender differences in math performance. Participants were either told girls are better in math, boys are better in math, or that girls and boys are equal in math ability. The control group read a passage about campaign finance reform in order to avoid subtly triggering stereotype threat in the participants. An ANOVA did not reveal the anticipated interaction between student gender and condition that would indicate stereotype threat. The experiment was then replicated using a manipulation check to ensure that the students had noticed the stereotype and to confirm the absence of stereotype threat in this population. Once again, an ANOVA found no evidence of stereotype threat. A main effect for gender, however, approached significance (p=.053); the girls outscored the boys regardless of condition. Differences between the high school and college environments as well as the idiosyncrasies of this school and community are discussed as possible reasons for the surprising results.

ARE PERSONALITY TRAITS MORE HERITABLE FROM THE MALE OR FEMALE PARENT IN PAN TROGLODYTES:CHIMPANZEES?
Elizabeth Anne Baker
University High School Tucson, AZ. USA

No other species resembles the human species more than the Pan troglodyte. Over 98.4% of chimpanzee DNA is compatible with human DNA. This project examines the heritable source of chimpanzee personality traits used in human personality testing: Extraversion, Dependability Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and Openness, and factors of Dominance, Antisocialness and Subjective Well-Being.<br><br>This study examined the data from 117 chimpanzee subjects in a world-wide Chimpanzee program. Traits were measured by a seven-point Likert scale completed by volunteers or zookeepers. Pearson Product Moment correlations between the personality traits of the parents and the personality traits of the offspring were calculated. The data was analyzed by sex of the parents and offspring, siblings, and same zoo versus different zoo location. Correlations were tested at the .05 level of significance.<br><br>The results revealed that 100% of the personality traits were more highly correlated with the mother as compared to the father. 87.5% of the personality traits were more highly correlated between the mother and the female offspring versus 12.5% correlated with the father. Specifically, 62.5% of the traits were more highly correlated with the mother and the male offspring versus 37.5% with the father. The differences between zoo location were not significant overall.<br><br>Based on the results, it can be concluded that personality traits of the Pan troglodytes are more heritable from the mother chimpanzee. The female offspring inherit a higher number of personality traits from the female parent. The results have implications for the prediction of human problems and prevention.

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS LIST PATTERNS ON SHORT-TERM SERIAL MEMORY
Michael Andrew Juang
D. W. Daniel High School, Central SC, U. S. A.

This study investigates the effects of various list patterns on short-term serial memory tests taken immediately after memorizing the list. Originally, the study was going to test if both time after memorizing and talking the test, as well as the pattern of the list had an effect on the data. Later, the study was narrowed to only focus on the pattern of the given list. Typically, when the words are given in a serial recall test, they are listed vertically, with the first item at the top. This study tests if changing the position of the words but keeping the serial position number (one for the first word, five for the fifth word, etc.) and the words themselves the same has an impact on the test results. <br><br>Sixty test subjects were divided equally into three groups. Each group was given a list and its corresponding test sheet with blanks for them to write the words they could recall. The subjects were then timed for a minute to memorize the words, in order (they were notified of this study’s procedure). After a minute was up, they turned back over the list, and then wrote down the answers on the test sheet for the next minute. When the frequency was plotted against the serial position for each pattern of the list, three distinct graphs were produced. Each seems to follow its own pattern as it progresses up the x-axis.<br><br>

THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF CONTINUAL AND PARTIAL REINFORCEMENT ON GIRLS
Casey King Hogle
Elko High School, Elko, NV, USA

Does positive reinforcement have short term effects? Does the time that 5th and 6th grade girls run 70 feet decrease at a faster rate when partial or continual reinforcement is administered? I assumed, as my background information affirmed, that those who were reinforced continually would be affected the most, and the partially reinforced group would be affected more than the control group.<br><br> Six basketball teams (divided into 3 groups of two teams each) were tested. Right before every practice, the girls ran individually. The subjects were reinforced by receiving a Hershey?s Kiss if their time was faster than their time in the practice directly preceding it. Subjects in one group were continually reinforced (every practice), subjects in another group were partially reinforced (every other practice), and the subjects in the control were not reinforced. <br><br> The data was analyzed with two-tailed hypothesis testing for both independent and dependent samples. The times of those in the control worsened, probably because of the lack of incentive. For both the continually reinforced and partially reinforced groups, times improved and then worsened. The decreased times support the effectiveness of both types of reinforcement. The increased times may have occurred because of a loss of interest, an insufficient reinforcer, or physical limitations. A significant difference was also discovered between the control and both reinforced groups. This difference gave evidence for the benefits of reinforcement over no reinforcement. The comparison of the effectiveness of partial versus continual reinforcement is inconclusive.<br><br>

NETWORK THEORY APPLIED TO INSTANT MESSAGING
Sari Ancel, Nicolet High School
Glendale, WI, U.S.

The Nicolet High School freshmen who communicate by computer through Instant Messenger form a network. Networks have various statistical properties that are interesting and can be used to predict the transmission of information through them. In a small-world network, any two participants have surprisingly few 'degrees of separation' between them. The network statistic that detects degree of separation is called average minimum path length. The average clustering coefficient of a network measures its cliquishness and plays a secondary role in determining whether the network is small-world (according to the theory of Watts and Strogatz). Another informative network statistic is the average number of connections at each node. This study gathered and analyzed data to determine whether the Nicolet freshman on-line communication network has small-world and other properties.<br><br> A survey asking students whom they communicate with at least once a week revealed that 288 of the surveyed students form a connected network. The data from this survey was analyzed using Excel statistical tools and Pajek, a network analysis program. The average minimum path length between two nodes in the network is 2.49, showing that the network is extremely small-world. Therefore, information and viruses would disseminate very quickly. The clustering coefficient is quite low showing that the network is not cliquish. This confirms the observation that Nicolet students communicate outside their groups of immediate friends. It also shows that the strict Watts-Strogatz criteria would place this network closer to a random network than a small-world network.<br><br>

ARE WE DESTINED TO FORGET?
Cheryl Roxanne Howell
Roy Junior High, Roy, Utah, USA

The subject studied was short-term memory. It was studied in order to determine what happens with gender and age. The idea came from personal experience. Knowledge was wanted on whether or not memory gets better or worse with age and gender. <br><br> In order to get the answer items were gathered for a short-term memory test. The hypothesis was that the peak of short-term memory for both genders would be between 21 and 40 years old. Items were chosen that most subjects would recognize. The items were placed on a tray and shown for one minute to subjects of different age groups and genders. Then a cover was placed over the items. The subjects were given 5 minutes to write down everything that they recalled. <br><br> After testing as many subjects as possible, the information was entered into a spreadsheet. From that spreadsheet a percentage table was made in order to see what percent of the items were recalled. These two data tables helped to make graphs that enhanced the understanding of the information gathered. The percentage graph was especially helpful. It facilitated making a graph with trend lines to be able to determine the age group that recalled the most for each gender. <br><br> The trend lines supported the hypothesis. The males recalled more between the ages of 21 and 30. The females recalled more between the ages of 31 to 40. <br><br>

SPEED AND CELL PHONES - ARE MALE OR FEMALE BRAINS BETTER SUITED FOR THE TASK?
Elais M. Ponton
Franklin High School, El Paso Texas, USA

Using a simulation task, this project investigated whether hands-free cell phone use interferes with driving ability and if interference effects exist in brain activity. This study also examined whether differences exist in the brain activity and driving styles between males and females. The null hypothesis was that there would no significant interference effects on driving or brain activity, nor between males and females. Sixteen 15-17 year old teens were tested. Brain activity was recorded from 40 EEG scalp electrodes from each subject during four conditions; (1) driving alone, (2) completing a simulated driving course without attending to words presented through ear phones, (3) attending to words and counting target words without driving, and (4) attending and counting words while driving. Overall, there was a significant increase in upper speed limit (> 80 MPH) violations while driving and counting words; further analysis showed this was only statistically significant for males. While driving, subjects were significantly less consistent counting target words. In addition, brain activity associated with memory processes necessary to detect target words was also significantly reduced while driving. A relationship was also found between levels of beta, 13-30 Hz, brain activity (associated with higher cognitive processes) and word counting, but only for females. Based on these results, the null hypothesis was rejected. These findings suggest that even hands-free cell phone use negatively affects driving, more for males than for females. Conversely, driving impacts both brain activity and memory processes required to remember information presented through headphones.

For thirteen years the Electronics Course of Liberato Foundation (Brazilian Technical High School) has in its scholarship plan a work, called PIPA (Program of Incentive to Applied Research), where the third and forth grade students have to develop research works over the year.<br><br>My project has the purpose of investigates the PIPA, its relevance to involved students and teachers but without intention to solve a target-problem. It aims the analysis and interpretation of data, configuring a qualitative research, following scientific production methodology. <br><br>The field research was conducted at Liberato Foundation from 08/29 to 10/08/2002 and the interviewed people are ten third and fourth grade students and six teacher, all of them from the Liberato's Electronics Course. With the interviews is possible analyze the opinion of the ones who have been through by the process of building scientific researches and compare the truth of bibliography's data.<br><br>Concluding, research works are seen by educators as essential elements in educative environment, once they escape from the simple tranmission and copy of data and they make students search for information, producing their knowledge exchanging ideas with teachers. This increases the worth of what students has learnt, makes them acquire new skills, grow and have contact with new elements, what rarely can provide. Proposals like PIPA are greatly important to involves people because they allow that research can be made in high school with success. <br><br>

RESEARCH ON SOME BEER COMMERCIALS AIRED ON TELEVISION ANALIZING THE ETHICAL ISSUE
Luis Fernando Prudente Silva, ETE Professor Basilides de Godoy
Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil

The study of advertising allows us to understand many aspects of the image of the system itself and of its ideologies, being this research one mechanism to help us in the knowledge and commerce of the product advertised through several media.<br><br>This study had as goals: 1 – Analyze some beer commercials aired on television, focusing on the ethical issue; 2 – Approach those commercials based on an analysis of the CONAR (National Board for Self-Regulation in Advertising) resolution.<br><br>We have conducted part of the analysis from January 2002 to January 2003. The notes on what should be focused on in the commercials were registered on a table with the following assessment criteria: Company; Brand; Product; Setting; Characters; Description of the Commercial; Language (Discourse); How the commercial ends.<br><br>In the commercials there are conversations between men and women in settings of social gathering like bars and beaches, being the woman’s role always more prominent. The discourse is presented in an ambiguous way most of the times, possibly disrespecting people’s sexuality or nationality. Thus, many times prejudice is presented as something usual in day-by-day media, fostering discrimination and social problems. <br><br>In conclusion, we have noticed that most of the analyzed commercials show transgressions of the Code of Ethics in Advertisement, and therefore should not be aired. We also propose a more detailed study on such kinds of commercials.<br><br>

A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO MULTIPLE-WINNER ELECTIONS: AUGMENTING VOTER IMPACT THROUGH A CLEVER STRATEGY
Brian Jeffrey Pepper
Middletown High School, Middletown, MD, USA

The School Board in Frederick County, Maryland is elected in a multiple-winner election. Voters are allowed, but not required, to cast as many votes as there are open seats. In a recent election, supporters of one candidate were urged to cast a single vote for that candidate only, discarding their other votes. This is referred to as "undervoting." It would seem that this should help by limiting the votes cast for rival candidates, but its full impact is unclear.<br><br>This project attempts to quantify that impact through the use of mathematical models and computer simulations. A simplified election model divided voters into three groups: undervoters (who use undervoting in support of a specific candidate), random voters (who vote essentially randomly), and traditional voters (who favor two incumbents and may or may not oppose the undervoter candidate). Repeated election simulations were conducted to determine the effect of different sets of assumptions.<br><br>Overall, this project demonstrates that undervoting is an effective strategy that will increase voter impact by approximately 75%. Traditional voters, voting against the undervoter-supported candidate, will have a significant negative impact on their candidacy. When the number of traditional voters exceeds 2.5 times that of undervoters, the undervoter-supported candidate is effectively blocked from winning. Given these assumptions, the effect of voter turnout is significant. An overall 2% change in support can easily be the difference between success and defeat.<br><br>This strategy could be used by a clever candidate to augment the impact of their supporters.

HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE ORIENTATED AND PREPARED TO FACE A FIRE?
Francisco Javier Nazario
Jose S. Alegria, Dorado, Puerto Rico

The problem studied in this research was to determine how many families have the knowledge and the preparation to react to a fire in their house. The hypothesis was that if the families have no knowledge and no preparation to face a fire in their house, they won't be able to act appropriately in case of a fire emergency. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. Part I, had questions about the preparation and knowledge that people should have in case of an emergency. Part II, has to do with the ability that people should have to manage a fire in the house. The questionnaire was administered to one hundred families from Barrio Higuillar of Dorado. These were selected at random. The most outstanding discoveries were the lack of orientation and preparation among these families to face a fire in their homes. These families would be vulnerable if a fire occurred because of their difficulty for leaving their homes safely. It was also found that they are not prepared to confront a fire because of their lack of orientation and their lack of ability to use fire equipment.

FACIAL SYMMETRY AND PHEROMONE PREFERENCE IN HUMAN SEX SELECTION
Mallory Jayne McGowin
School of the Osage High School, Kaiser, MO, USA

All animals, including humans, produce pheromones, or chemical substances that are produced to stimulate a behavioral response in other individuals of the same species. Studies have shown that the more symmetrical a person’s face is, the more attractive the individual appears (Grammer and Thornhill, 1994). However, to this date a study linking pheromones and symmetry has not been performed. The purpose of this project was to attempt to determine the presence of a correlation between pheromone preference and facial symmetry. Eight males were randomly selected from a distant high school and were asked to wear three t-shirts, each for two consecutive nights. After the two-night odor collection period, shirts were collected and frozen in separate containers at a temperature of approximately –75 degrees Celsius until the day of the olfactory session. A list of fifty-eight females ranging from high school sophomores to seniors from School of the Osage was compiled to use as olfactory subjects. Each female olfactory subject was asked to rate male donor t-shirts on pleasantness, sexiness, and familiarity. Photos of the male odor donors were subsequently rated on attractiveness.<br><br> Results of this study indicate a significant (P< 0.05) correlation between the responses of female subjects to the three questions posed and each donor’s corresponding photo which suggests a correlation between pheromone detection and attractiveness. Results also demonstrate a significant (P< 0.05) correlation when symmetry is compared to photos, pleasantness, and sexiness. There was no correlation found between slope and photos or slope and olfactory questions.<br><br>

RECALL OF VISUALLY PRESENTED MATERIAL
Shannon Quinn Turney
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills KY, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether different forms of recalling memories, and whether leading questions, have any effect on false memory creation. A real-time video of a car crash was shown to volunteers. Immediately after viewing the event, some subjects were asked to verbalize it in written form and others in oral form. A third group did no formal recall. Testing with leading, moderately leading, or neutral questions followed in the same session. Overall, those who did no verbal recall scored highest on individual items, with percentages ranging from 70% to 96%. Those who orally recounted the event had the lowest accuracy, with correct responses only 32% to 50% of the time. There was one exception to the "no recall" group performing best. On that item, those engaged in the written recall scored highest. In the analysis involving leading questions, trends were obvious. With questions that did not have precisely defined answers, but rather required estimates, the leading questions were more effective in creating false memories. Other questions, that asked for yes-or-no answers and expressed doubt, led subjects to believe that the answer to the item was "no" when in fact, it was "yes." Curiously though, some leading questions produced an effect opposite to the intended effect, but further research would be necessary to understand this phenomenon. <br><br>After one week and again after two weeks, subjects were again tested with differently worded leading questions. In testing after one and two weeks, differences in memory were observed; however, these did not reveal a specific trend. All results seem to indicate that verbally recounting events and responding to leading questions enhance the likelihood of producing false memories.<br><br>

LUNACY THE AFFECTS OF THE FULL MOON ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Christine Jamie Bedont
Mont Harmon Junior High School, Price, Utah, United States

<br><br> The purpose of my science fair project is to prove that human behavior is affected by the full moon's gravitational pull. To complete this project, I first interviewed public safety personnel to see if there was a common belief that the full moon affected behavior. I then asked each department contacted for information or data on crime/incidents for the year 2002. I gathered data from the Price City Police Department, Carbon County Sheriff's Office, Price City Fire Department and the Price Communications Center. Information was also gathered from back issues of The Sun Advocate, our local newspaper. I counted the incidents from each department, including jail bookings into the Carbon County Jail, for the dates of the full moon in the year 2002. I used from sundown to sunrise the next day as my frame of reference. This information was then charted. I chose the same period of time on the third and fourth day of each month as my control date and charted this information. The number of incidents for the full moon and the control date were averaged and these numbers were compared. The results for all departments show a noticeable increase of incidents on the night of a full moon. All data and averages prove my hypothesis correct. The majority of individuals interviewed stated that they believed that the full moon affects behavior. My data also indicates that their observations were correct.

COLOR MY WORLD
Adrian Leanne Thomas
North Lamar ISD, Paris, Texas, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to find if the color you are surrounded by affects short-term memory. The test subjects were surrounded on 5 separate occasions with 5 different solid color curtains that were red, yellow, green, blue, and white. To test audio short-term memory 20 words were called out during the duration of one minute, and after the minute time period was completed the subject called back as many of the words that they could remember. Then, they were handed a sheet with 10 pictures to memorize during one minute. When the time period was up, they were handed a blank sheet and a bag with 50 pictures in it. They were asked to find the pictures on the original sheet and put them in their correct position. To analyze data, the percent correct that each test subject scored in the audio testing portion were averaged for each day, and then the visual scores were averaged in the same way. These percents were then averaged together to find a total average percent correct for each day. The average percent of the audio and visual results showed Day 1(red) had 58% correct, Day 2(yellow) had 64% correct, Day 3 (green) had 57.5% correct, Day 4 (blue) had 58% correct, and Day 5 (white) had 57% correct. It can be concluded from the data that the color yellow stimulates short-term audio and visual memory when compared to the colors of red, green, blue, and white.

DO PUPIL SIZE CHANGES CORRELATE WITH OTHER BIOPHYSICAL RESPONSES? (BIG EYES, BIG LIES?)
Christina Marie Mariolana Zoccoli
Academy of Notre Dame de Namur, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States 

The threat of terrorism to America’s public transportation increases the need to adequately screen all passengers. Unfortunately, security resources are very limited, and current procedures are highly subjective and largely based on ethnic profiling.<br><br> Ideally, the threat that each passenger poses could be assessed by using traditional lie detectors that monitor bodily responses while asking questions such as, "Are you carrying any weapons?" However, this is neither unobtrusive nor practical.<br><br> Since bodily responses measured during lie detector tests (heart rate, respiration rate, galvanic skin response, and blood pressure) correlate with one another, it is possible that they also correlate with pupillary size, another more unobtrusively observable response. A "veracity score" could be given to each passenger based on this observed response during routine questioning. A "score threshold" could then identify passengers whose threat potential warrants additional screening.<br><br> This experiment investigates the correlation between the traditional lie detector measurements of galvanic skin response, respiration rate, and pulse rate, and the unobtrusively measured investigational response, pupillary size. Measurements of these biophysical responses are taken during questioning with a series of emotionally neutral questions, and a series of non-offensive, non-personal questions designed to evoke an emotional response. Statistical analysis of the results indicates the degree to which the new measure of pupillary size correlates with the traditional lie detector biophysical responses.<br><br> The results of this project suggest an easy and unobtrusive way for Homeland Security to asses each passenger’s likelihood of posing a threat, by evaluating their pupillary responses to relevant questioning.

EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT MOVIE GENRES
Nicholas Jon Papez
Park City High School, Park City, UT, USA

My experiment is to watch four different movie genre's, and to see how people's emotional reactions were affected. During each movie, I recorded their pulses every 20 minutes. During the movie, I recorded everyone on my camcorder for 15 minutes for their outward reactions. I also recorded how many times they cried. The four different movie genre's are my independent variable and the people's emotional reactions are my dependent variable.<br><br> I did this experiment to find out how people react emotionally to different movie genres. Such as what genre will make people cry most or what genre gets people's pulse rates beating the fastest. I also did this experiment to find out if by watching these movies creates any long lasting effects.<br><br> Surprisingly, I concluded that Horror and Drama are my most similar genres in audience response. Even though the genres are quite different, my data showed that they had many similarities. Both genres had males and females that created distractions on certain emotional scenes and in both genres people cried, which shows that Horror nand Drama were my most emotional genres.<br><br> After I was finished gathering all my data, I compared pulse rates and outward reactions of different individuals and sexes. I found out that the males are more emotional than the females even though they did not show it through their physical reactions and that my hypothesis was correct which was that people's reactions do increase emotionally as movie genre's increase in emotional intensity.

CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BRAIN HEMISPHERE DOMINANCE, PRIMARY LEARNING STYLE AND GENDER
Gordon Bradley Simmons
Aldershot School, Burlington, Ontario, Canada

The purpose of this project was to determine if there was a significant correlation between brain hemisphere dominance, preferred learning style and gender. The reason for studying these variables and any correlations is to determine if there is a better way for people to learn.<br><br>84 students were tested using a questionnaire that included a brain hemisphere dominance inventory and Kolb’s learning style inventory, and subjects were also asked to identify their gender. 14 adults were also tested as a control group for the possibility of an age variable. The results were collected and analysed using tools from the “Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 11” such as crosstabulations, and the Pearson product moment correlation with two-tailed significance. Both of these are commonly used instruments in the field of statistics. The Pearson correlation tool determines the size and direction of a correlation, and crosstabulations assist in graphing any relationship.<br><br>It was determined that there were no significant correlations between any of brain hemisphere dominance, preferred learning style or gender.<br><br>The data leads us to believe that people cannot easily be classified into particular learning and thinking groups; each student is different. In showing us that each student learns in unique ways, we can infer that the method we use to teach each student should be different.<br><br>

GENDER AND FACULTY PERCEPTION OF ADOLESCENT ADJUSTMENT
Erin Margaret White
Immaculata High School, Somerville, NJ, USA

The purpose of this research was to determine if the gender of an individual athlete affected the score given by a high school teacher to evaluate an individual's adjustment to adolescent life. Three identical case studies, which included details of an adolescent's lifestyle, were administered to two central New Jersey high schools. The case presented differed only by the gender of the individual. The means of the 30 male case responses and the 29 no gender case responses were not significantly different, but a t test indicated an extremely significant difference between the male case and the 30 female case responses. It was found that high school teachers view female adolescent athletes as far less adjusted to life based on sex role stereotyping.

SOCIAL COGNITION AND JURY BIAS TOWARD THE ELDERLY IN THE COURTROOM A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Michael Duane Buhrmester
Plano Senior High School, Plano, Tx, USA

This research underscores the problem of juror “bias” and unfair juror treatment of elderly adults in the legal system. This study addressed three questions: 1) are jurors’ explicit (thoughtful, evaluative) and implicit (unconscious, reflexive) attitudes consistent with each other, or are some jurors’ implicit attitudes contradictory with their explicit beliefs? 2) which type of attitude, explicit vs. implicit, is more important in determining jurors’ verdict-decisions? and 3) does the importance of explicit vs. implicit attitudes in decision- making vary according to the type of case/decision that jurors are judging?<br><br> One-hundred mock-jurors (ages 16-75; M = 30 yrs.), recruited from high school, college, and family friends, completed Explicit and Implicit Attitude Measures then read and gave verdict decisions on three summarized mock court cases focused on witness competency, litigant morality, and defendant competency/morality, respectively.<br><br> Analyses revealed that: 1) jurors hold two differentiated sets (positive and negative) of explicit attitudes and a more general, single implicit attitude (negative) about the elderly; 2) jurors’ verdicts reveal significant bias against the elderly when witness competency is questioned (verdict 45% for elderly witness vs. 80% for young); however, jurors are also biased in favor of the elderly when witness morality is questioned (verdict 70% for elderly litigant vs. 30% for young) 3) jurors’ implicit good attitudes predicted their verdicts about witness morality and their explicit competence attitudes predicted their verdicts about witness accuracy. These findings emphasize the significance of differentiated attitude systems (implicit versus explicit) and the biased attitude processing that influences basic decision-making. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF STATE-DEPENDENT LEARNING ON FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Gabriella Maria Cane
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America

This experiment tested the theory of state-dependent learning, which predicts that students who study and test in the same environment will recall more learned information than those who study and test in different environments. The purpose of this experiment was to identify a learning and testing environment that would produce better test scores for students. This study explores the effects of environmental cues, mood, and visual vs. verbal stimuli on the memory of female high school students. Eighty high school students who were in the same environment and mood at encoding and retrieval recalled significantly more information than students in different environments and moods. In addition, students who were shown visual stimuli recalled significantly more material than students who were shown verbal stimuli. The three factors explored in this experiment(environment, mood, and stimuli) were additive becasue all of the interactions between the factors were insignificant. This happening created an additive effect, which aided in defining a "best" and "worst" case study/test environment. The "best" recall was demonstrated when students were exposed to visual stimuli, were in a mood-congurent condition and were in the same environment while they studied and tested. The "worst" recall was demonstarted when students were exposed to verbal stimuli, were in a mood-incongruent condition and were in "different" environments while they studeied and tested. Students who were in the "best" condition during this experiment would have recieved 2 letter grades higher than students in the "worst" condition, had this experiment been an actiual exam or test. The implications of this study can help students and teachers by providing strategies to improve student recall and test scores.

MUSICAL NUMBERS: A NEW MATH
Alicia Marie Baumgartner
Strasburg Public, Strasburg, North Dakota, United States

The objective of this project was to teach second graders new "numbers" and mulitiplication facts through the use of music. To see if a different portion of the brain could also be stimulated by the music. <br><br>The first step was to come up with 10 imaginary "numbers" to accompany ten musical notes.The students were then divided up into two groups. One group was taught the "numbers" just by looking at them. The other group was given the "numbers" and the music. The students were taught the numbers and asked to recall them. For the group with music, the note was played while the student tried to recall the number. The "numbers" were then multiplied together. A total of 23 facts could be made. The students were taught the mulitiplication facts and asked to recall them. For the group with music, the equation and answer were played while they were being taught. When asked to recall them, just the equation was played. For this round the students were timed. Finally, all of the mulitiplication facts were written out. The students were asked to complete as many as possible and were given as much time as needed. There was no music played for this round. All of the students were under the same conditions. Again they were timed and mistakes were recorded. <br><br>It is concluded that the different portion of the brain again made that connection to the music. Music bridged the gap between the memory and mathematical parts of the brain.

"NOVEL TEACHERS BEFORE THE SCHOOL TORMOIL"
Maria Valeria Leyes
Instituto Nuestra Senora de los Angeles, Concordia, Entre Rios, Argentina.

The objective of this research is to know what the role of initial training is in novel teacher’s flexibility of adaptation to the present situation of social turmoil<br><br>The hypothesis of this work proposes that novel teachers are not prepared to adapt to the present social turmoil, since nowadays, techers perform their work in deplorable conditions: Low salaries, environments of meager school infrastructure, scarce material resources, violence in schools, teachers’ exhaustion and accumulation of demands made onto them, changes in the teacher’s role. <br><br>The theoretical framework provides the categories of analysis on which the methodological perspective and the choice of qualitative and quantitative techniques are based. The data gathering instruments of these techniques are opinion polls and school biographies requested to highschoo teachers of the city of Concordia. However, the alternative is that the sampling be SIGNIFICANT, in other words, that it be carried out through the selection and intensive study of a few rich cases to generate hypothesis and theories. <br><br>The analysis performed makes it possible to prove that the economic uncertainty teachers perceive brings about the lack of motivation, the lack of facilities needed to find a modus vivendi in schools, the lack of basic materials for teachers, the violence in schools, the teachers’ feeling of being under a stronger pressure, and their need of facing up with new challenges for which they have not been prepared.<br><br>

HIDDEN INSTINCT
Ben Jacob Novak
Alexander High School, Alexander, ND USA

There are many questions about the way evolution works. Does natural selection strive for the most suitable physical characteristics? Or does it strive for the most efficient behavioral characteristics? If it does, are these behavioral characteristics passed on genetically generation after generation like physical characteristics? There is a theory to explain the answer to these questions. It is the theory of hidden instinct. It proposes that behaviors are passed on genetically, and if the behaviors of the ancestral species are not needed in a particular descendent species, the behaviors stay hidden in the genetics and can, in later evolved species that have use of the behaviors, become expressed once again. This suggests that evolution and natural selection are pushing for the best suitable psychological traits for species survival, not only the physical traits that accompany the psychological characteristics. To test this theory, an experiment has been designed to observe the behavior of planarians, animals with very simple and primitive brains. This is important because planarians would make the base of the behaviors for most of the animal kingdom. The planarians are tested in wild and domestic habitats to observe if there is a hidden set of behaviors not expressed by the worms in a the wild. These behaviors are examples of ³hidden instincts². The planarians are also observed for behaviors of more advanced animals, offering proof for behaviors being genetically passed on from primitive species to more advanced species. This evidence would provide the substantial proof for this intriguing new idea on the working of evolution.<br><br>

SOLIDARY ACTION FOOD STRATEGY IN ADELIA MARIA, CORDOBA, ARGENTINA
Maria Laura Mola
I. P. E. M. N0 292, Adelia Maria, Cordoba, Argentina.

This applied investigation arose in view of the problem of lack of food in indigent families from Adelia Maria, Cordoba, Argentina. It approached a strategy based on a solidary sustainable action during 2002, as an alternative of solution to the problem.<br><br>The solidary action consisted in a nutritional plan based on soy beans, a resource of the region. The designated people were 40 indigent families from an urban marginal neighbourhood of the town. The plan was based on the making and distribution of food an the later training of the people. The objective of this was that people could learn to maket their own food with soy beans and adopt the habit of eating them.<br><br>During the exploratory phase of this descriptive study a non- participant and non- structured observation was used. A documentary compilation was also used.<br><br>The employed data collecting instruments were observation and interviews.<br><br>The investigation allowed to prove that a plan of solidary action is posible to make. It had a high level of support by farmers who donated soy beans. The I.P.E.M. N0 292 school gave the place for the completion of the plan. People from other institutions supporter this action. These solidary actions together with nutritional alimentary education provided a strategy that reduces the lack of food in indigent families.<br><br>So it is thought to extend the scope of this plan to all the indigent families of the town and make the benefits of it application known.

THE MCGURK EFFECT: DOES AGE MATTER?
Elisabeth Lee Crabtree
Byng High School, Ada, Oklahoma, USA

Most people assume that they see and hear the world through two distinctly separate sensory channels; however, recent research indicates that some neurons in the brain respond to aural and visual stimuli simultaneously. Individuals experience the McGurk Effect when viewing a video of a person mouthing a syllable dubbed with the audio of a different syllable. <br><br> The objectives of this project were to compare the awareness of aural and visual roles in speech perception and the occurrence and perceptions of the McGurk Effect among different age groups. Prior to testing, subjects were asked if they thought their eyes help them hear. Two hundred eighty subjects were tested using three syllable pairs (aural BA-visual GA, aural MA-visual KA, and aural PA-visual FA). Twenty males and twenty females in each of seven age groups from early childhood through late adulthood individually viewed three videos of the researcher mouthing a syllable dubbed with a different aural syllable, and responded with what was perceived. Each also listened to the audio only and told what was heard.<br><br> A total of 1480 responses were analyzed using a Factorial Analysis of Variance of Proportions. The following conclusions were drawn: 1.) There are differences between age groups in prior knowledge of aural and visual roles in speech perception; 2.) The occurrence of the McGurk Effect varies depending on the pairing of syllables, and 3.) Variation exists among age groups in reported perception of a specific aural-visual stimulus.

AUTISM THERAPY: THE EFFECTS OF SELF-STIMULATORS ON THE ABILITIES OF AUTISTIC PREADOLESCENTS
Shivani Ghoshal
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, CA, USA

This project, a result of teaching eleven autistic preadolescents of varying degrees of autism the piano for one year, demonstrates autism therapy experimentation to amplify the abilities of autistic preadolescents. Conscious of past childrens’ stagnation from limitations of conventional therapy’s dogma of removal of self-stimulatory behavior, I devised a therapy program that manipulated rather than disposed the student’s behavioral problems.<br><br> Rather than utilizing the template format of conventional autistic therapy, each student’s therapy integrated his or her own self-stimulators to learn a piece, First, overselectivities were strongly integrated to impart the autistic student familiarity and motivation. Overselectivities were then emphasized to increasingly lesser extents, until the student was able to play the piano piece independently.<br><br> Results from my therapy showed unexpected, remarkable growth of ability for the preadolescent children; psychological growth is not expected in autistic children over seven. The increased efficiency of my therapy program was displayed when viewing the past three years of conventional therapeutical data for each student. Prior to my therapy, each had been involved in a unit of piano playing; all had failed to learn the piano under conventional therapy. Under my therapy, all students showed growth, some even achieving early intermediate levels.<br><br> The contributions of this project are immeasurable. The fusion of self-stimulators in autistic therapy may strongly augment autistic childrens’ abilities to perform increasingly complex tasks. More importantly, many autistic preadolescents, all deemed “gone cases” after the age of seven, may indeed harbor room for growth and performance of new, highly complex tasks. <br><br>

TWINS WIN?
Ruth Anne Whitfield
Reserve High School, Reserve, NM 87830, USA

After being fascinated with my identical twin nephews and participating in controversial clone/twin debates I decided that I would conduct a Science Fair experiment with twins as my subject. I focused on non-verbal communication and came up with a project focused on the comparison of twins, siblings, and same age subjects in terms of playing charades. I organized data on number of guesses and time completion. Twins were most successful throughout this project. My results show that twins nailed the charade 87.2% of the time, siblings with a lower 76.4%, and same age subjects behind with the least - 69.4%. In time completion (correctly guessing the charade within the designated limit) twins had a success rate of 80.1%, behind them were the siblings with 71.4%, and last were the same age subjects with 65.8%. My results support my hypothesis. The twins communicated nonverbally more effectively than the other test subjects (siblings and same age subjects). If I were allowed to continue my project I would make an effort to increase my sample size.

THE EFFECTS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SPACE REVERSAL ON VISUAL PERCEPTION IN CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT DYSLEXIA: PHASE III
Stephanie Alexandra Williams
Pacific Collegiate School, Santa Cruz, CA, USA

The Purpose of this study was to determine if children between the ages of nine and twelve with dyslexia are able to read and understand with more accuracy passages presented when the positive and negative space is reversed (black background with white letters). It was hypothesized that the reading accuracy and comprehension of the dyslexic students would be improved with this reversal of positive and negative space. A test was created consisting of four paragraphs (two presented normally and two reversed) and two reading comprehension questions per passage. A total of 37 dyslexic students and 34 non-dyslexic students were tested. The students were given 90 seconds to read each passage, the reading comprehension questions were given and answered orally. <br><br> It was found that the dyslexic students made less errors when reading the passages presented on the black background. The reading comprehension of the dyslexic students was slightly improved by the reversal of positive and negative space.The reversal of the positive and negative space had no effect on the non-dyslexic students reading accuracy or comprehension. A chi-square test was completed comparing the black and white background reading accuracy for the dyslexic students. This test yielded a P-value of 3.46E-20 (a highly significant value). In addition a Comparison of Two Means test was also completed comparing background color which also yielded significant results. Finally a 99% Confidence Interval was established, from which it can be said with a 99% confidence that the mean reading errors of the dyslexic students will be 1.65 less when reading reversed passages. Thus, it can be concluded that it is beneficial for dyslexic students to read passages presented when the positive and negative space is reversed.

THE COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF SECONDHAND SMOKE ON FIRST GRADE STUDENTS
Bridget Sarah Confait
West Lauderdale High School, Collinsville, MS, United States

Current research shows that not only is secondhand smoke a carcinogen,but also it may be associated with learning and discipline problems in young children. The purpose of this project was to determine the cognitive and behavioral effects of secondhand smoke on First Grade students through testing and completion of a survey.<br><br> These hypotheses were made about the purpose. Exposure to secondhand smoke will affect the cognitive ability of First Grade students. Exposure to secondhand smoke will negatively affect the behavior of First Grade students. Exposure to secondhand smoke will negatively affect the health of First Grade students.<br><br> After completion of a survey by the students parents, the procedure consisted of testing each student in the areas of math and English. The math test consisted of problems in a written format. The English test contained both a written and memory test. Four different tests in each area were given at different times. The students discipline records were also surveyed and comparisons made.<br><br> Results showed First Grade students who were exposed to higher levels of secondhand smoke experienced more learning and discipline problems. These students overall were more prone to health problems, particularly upper respiratory problems.<br><br> It can be concluded that parents, educators, pediatricians and child psychologists should take a closer look at the effect of secondhand smoke on children.

BRAIN VS BRAWN: DOES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AFFECT PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION?
LaShanna Antoinette Young, Dionne LaBrada Solomon, Kyle Landon Young
WildWood High School, Wildwood, Florida, USA

When starting this project, the researchers involved were curious to determine whether a relationship exists between physical health and psychological function. From their inquiries, the researchers discovered that physical activity increases blood and oxygen flow to the brain and creates new brain cells as well as dendrites.<br><br>In order to test their hypothesis, the researchers presented a questionnaire containing two memorization tests to ten of the athletes on both the girls' and boys' basketball teams at their school. They also distributed the tests to ten non-athletic students who attended their school. Each of the three groups were given the tests at three times during the course of nine weeks, leaving three-week intervals in between each testing session. Distrubuting the tests at these particular times would ensure that the athletes' progress in relation to the advancement of physical activity in their daily regimen could be recorded and compared to the scores of the non-athletes. After the testing, the three researchers collected and compared the questionnaires to be used as data in their project.<br><br>Via their research, the researchers discovered that a link does exist between physical activity and cognitive function. The experiment also proved true the original hypthesis, showing higher test averages for the athletes in comparison with the non-athletes, as well as a rise in the athletes' scores as the season progressed and physical activity increased. Therefore, through their experimentation and research, these researchers have come to the conclusion that physical activity should result in elevation in the psychological function of humans. <br><br>

SUBLIMINAL STIMULI – DO YOU GET THE MESSAGE?
Sadie Katherine Reinbold, Joo-Hye "Christine" Park
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD, USA

Our experiment was designed to see if people could receive messages without consciously recognizing what the message is. These messages are called subliminal messages.<br><br> We made a video clip to test if subliminal visual word stimuli would affect the test subjects. The video flashed ten subliminal messages: five controls and five stimuli. The stimuli were actual words, but the controls did not show a word at all. The purpose of the controls was to see if the correct word choices made by the test subjects were coincidental or not. Each message was flashed for 100 ms. After each message was given, we gave the subject a set of five words: one synonym of the stimulus, one antonym, one word that begins with the same letter as the stimulus, and two words unrelated to the stimulus. Then the subject circled one of the five words.<br><br> In our hypothesis, we believed that the subliminal stimuli would affect the participants, and they would choose one of the three words related to the corresponding stimulus included in the set of five words. We also hypothesized that the results will be completely random on the word sets for the controls.<br><br> After analyzing the data, we concluded that subliminal stimuli in the form of visual words flashed during video presentations do not have an effect on the viewer. We compared the data for the control sets and the stimuli sets, but found no considerable difference in the number of related words chosen in the two categories.

DO LEARNING STYLES AND THIRD GRADE GPA PREDICT ACADEMIC SUCCESS?
Melissa Marie Neuwirth, Sonny Raye Massar
Francis Howell North High School, St. Charles MO, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if learning styles and third grade GPA were predictors of academic success. There were 119 participants from ninth to twelfth grade in this experiment. Fifty participants were part of the honors group which consisted of students in honors classes. These classes are based on a 5.0 GPA scale. Fifty three participants were part of the control group, which consisted of non-honor level classes based on a 4.0 GPA scale. Sixteen participants were at risk students, whose individual nature made it difficult to learn. All subjects were given a survey, Inventory of Learning Styles Test, and a consent form to fill out. Null hypothesis one, stating that Learning Styles had no effect on academic success, was accepted. The dominant teaching styles of high school are visual and sequential. When the GPA’s of the students with those dominant styles were compared between the three groups, honors had higher GPA’s than other two groups. When the statistical analysis was done, this was proven insignificant. Null hypothesis two, stating that third grade GPA had no effect on academic success, was rejected. When the change in GPA from third to ninth grade was compared, honors had less of a change than the non-honors and at risk groups. This part of the experiment proved to be significant. Other factors were looked at from the survey such as family dynamics, independent reading ages, and how information was taught in their classroom. The independent reading ages of the honors group were lower than those of the non-honors and at risk groups. There was a higher divorce rate among those in the non-honors and the at risk groups. Change in GPA was compared between the students who have a two-parent biological household, divorced parents, and other family circumstances.

COMPARISON OF CEPHALIC INDEX AND COGNITIVE ABILITY IN MALE AND FEMALE HOMO SAPIEN
Lauren Olivia Titus, Leah Gaiser
Mustang High School, Mustang Oklahoma, USA

Does a correlation exist between cognitive ability and cephalic index (a ratio of breadth over length of a skull multiplied by 100)? None has yet been recorded, hence the Hypothesis: If the cephalic index of a male or female in the 10th, 11th, or 12th grade is calculated, then it will bear no correlation to the results of his or her intelligence test. <br><br> A study has been composed according to the following Procedure: A 72 cm caliper measures skull length from glabella to opisthocranium and breadth across the zygomatic arches to calculate the cephalic indices of randomly-selected male and female subjects in each grade. An Intelligence Quotient test, obtained through the World Wide Web, is ussued to each subject, and while it is not a professional test, thus cannot provide a complete overview of the subject's abilities, it does serve as a means of comparison through data. The subjects are divided into 6 strata separated by both grade and gender, and a two-sample t-test is executed within each stratum. The Purpose: To determine if the results show a relationship between cephalic index and intelligence quotient. <br><br> Results (average): 10th: Male index=77.9, quotient=109.4<br><br> Female index=79.4, quotient=113.3<br><br> 11th: Male index=77.5, quotient=107.6<br><br> Female index=77.9, quotient=112.7<br><br> 12th: Male index=77.3, quotient=120.5<br><br> Female index=80.2, quotient=124.0<br><br> According to the data above and the t-test series performed, we came to the following Conclusion: The data was inconclusive, but the lack of discovery of a correlaion supports our hypothesis. Further testing is necessary for definite results.

REACTION IN ACTION
Jeremy Keith Palsgrove, Gilbert Gutierrez
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States

The purpose of the experiment was to test three different age groups ranging from twelve to eighteen on how quick their driving reaction time was. The experiment was also divided by gender and the test subjects listened to three types of music while they were being tested. The experiment was done in order to determine if there was a connection between reaction time and age, gender, or background music. The testing was also supposed to show if there were any plausible relationships between the age of a person and the minimum age requirement for getting a driver's license.<br><br> An apparatus was designed to measure a driver's breaking time. The results were determined by playing three different types of music while testing and by having one test with complete silence. Also the initial hope was to have a considerably large sample size of a diverse number of ages and an equal amount of males and females. This was a partial success because the groups were fairly diverse, but the total sample size was only fifty-six people. The small sample size may have crippled the results moderately but in the end they were determined to be reasonably fair.<br><br> The final results of the project turned out better than expected. The different age groups of males and females were tested and found to have noticeably different reaction times. The hypothesis was also found to be partially correct, since the male middle age group had the quickest reaction time, but the female middle age group had the second best. The results were also very clear that younger children and females had a slower reaction time and males over fourteen had the quickest. So all together, the experiment was a success and reliable results were found.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to show that cell phones, hand-held and hands-free, affect the time that a person has to react to a given situation. Although the researchers do not use a vehicle in this experiment, the purpose of this experiment was to show that distractions, such as cell phones, can cause slower reactions while driving.<br><br> To perform this experiment REACTION TIME, the researchers gathered 50 test subjects. Second, the researchers tested each person separately by letting them place their hand in the opening of the reaction distance apparatus where the meterstick was dropped. Third, the researchers told each test subject that the meterstick was going to be dropped and they needed to catch it as quickly as possible. Next, the researchers dropped the meterstick and recorded the distance the meterstick fell from the bottom of the meterstick to the top of their hand. The researchers then repeated this same exercise with someone talking to them on a hand-held cell phone and with someone talking to them on a hands-free cell phone.<br><br> Out of the 50 people tested, without talking on a cell phone, the test subjects had an average reaction distance of 21.26cm. While talking on a hand-held cell phone, the test subjects had a reaction distance of 30.30cm. While talking on a hands-free cell phone, the test subjects had an average reaction distance of 31.54cm.<br><br> By conducting this experiment, the researchers have concluded that cell phones, hand-held and hands-free, affect the time that a person has to react to a given situation. The researchers successfully completed a T-Test to show that there is no significant difference between the average reaction distance for talking on a hand-held cell phone and the average reaction distance for talking on a speaker phone.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VIDEO GAMES IN PEOPLE
Wildaliz Arias, Derek Mercado, Jacqueline Velez
Manuel Ramos Hernandez, Quebradillas, Puerto Rico

There is great concern among psychologists regarding the effects that playing video games have in children. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effects that playing passive and violent video games have in the blood pressure and the radial pulse of persons of different ages. To do this research a group of ten (10) children, age’s five to ten years, ten (10) youth and ten (10) adults were selected. There were two kinds of video games chosen for participants to play with, a passive one and violent one. The participants were interviewed by a registered nurse to answer questions about their health. She also monitored their blood pressure and their radial pulse before, during and after they played the video games. People suffering of certain health conditions were not allowed to participate in the research. All participants were asked to play for 30 minutes with each kind of video game. Analysis of the results demonstrated that all participants were significantly affected in their blood pressure and radial pulse rate. These results proved the hypothesis to be correct.

AGRESSIVENESS OF STRESSED CRAYFISH (PROCAMBARUS CLARKLL): EFFECTS OF PHOTOPERIOD AND POLYCHROMATIC SENSITIVITY IN THE MAINTENANCE OF DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES
Felix J. Jorge-Garcia, Rafael A. Torrech-Antonetty, Lynn M. Torrech-Antonetty
Isidro A. Sánchez High School, P.O. Box 1588, Luquillo PR 00773

The significance of dominance hierarchies is well established for crustacean species (Atema, 1986; Atema and Voight, 1995; Karavanich and Atema, 1993, 1998), but few studies have investigated the influence of light in the formation and maintenance of dominance hierarchies. The present investigation pretended to test the effects of crayfish polychromatic sensitivity in the formation and maintenance of dominance hierarchies, aggressiveness and urine production.<br><br> After establishing dominance hierarchies between crayfishes, subordinate and dominant specimens (males and females) were exposed to stressing photoperiods (20hr L:D), during different time intervals using different light color (white, red, blue, yellow, green and black). After this period fight trials were repeated and dominance hierarchies reviewed. The total number of interactions was annotated and the aggressiveness level at the pinnacle interaction point was also recorded.<br><br> Preliminary chemical urine analyses were conducted. Urine was collected from crayfishes submitted to different stimuli (color stimuli, variable photoperiod, predator threats, etc.).<br><br>The results showed that after exposed to stressing photoperiods subordinate males will continue to challenge dominant co specifics, and that crayfish are sensitive to different color lights. The aggressiveness of these organisms was also considerably increased.<br><br> Further extensive urine chemical analyses are proposed, including protein and pheromones composition.<br><br>

BRAIN ACTIVATION: ALTERNATIVE FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE LEARNING?
Aidalis Andino, Lisaida Andino
Superior Urbana Nueva, Yabucoa, Puerto Rico

Brain Activation exercises were investigated to see if they were a good alternative for a more effective learning in Mathematics and Spanish with the eleventh grade students of the "Escuela Superior Urbana".<br><br> The hypothesis is that these exercises are a good alternative for a more effective learning in these students and subjects.<br><br> Children and adolescents psychologist's expertise help was used throughout the process. Brain activation exercises were selected and adapted to help students in Spanish and Math classes. The exercises were presented to several psychiatrists for them to evaluate the exercises and determine if these could be harmful to students.<br><br> Teachers elaborated a Math and Spanish test and it was validated by seven eleventh grade students.<br><br> The participants were selected at random among the eleventh grade students in school. Students were informed that their participation was voluntary. Form 4-B was sent to the parents with a letter explaining the experiment. Fifty six students showed up to answer the test.<br><br> The first exam was administered. With a psychologist's assistance brain activation exercises more demonstrated and given on writing so that they could be practiced at home, twice a day for six consecutive days.<br><br> The same exam was administered a second time to the same students. The exams were graded and tabulated. The results were compared concluding that brain activation exercises were a good alternative for students in the subjects examined, because there was a significant increase was observed in their average score in Spanish and Mathematics.<br><br>

HOW FAST IS YOUR BEAT?
Nitra Cassedy Woods, Felecia Jones
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

We decided to determine how types of music affect people while driving using reaction times and blood pressure. We selected 60 high school students, 30 male/30 female, who could legally drive. We used songs of different music types, such as rap (Eminem "Lose Yourself"), rock (Disturbed "Stupified"), and classical (Instrumental by Beethoven). Testing consisted of two parts: driving a car and using a reaction time box we constructed. We measured blood pressure before/after each song for the driving and box tests. Drivers were instructed to drive around cones placed in the stadium parking lot while listening to music types, whereas the reaction box used different colored flashing light. Upon completion of testing, overall average blood pressures, in ascending order by diastolic, were: Boys -- classical 127/66, control 129/68, rap 128/73, rock 129/73; Girls -- control 122/62, rap 126/71, rock 127/71, classical 125/72. Results for the overall average of the participants' reaction box times, in order by second length, were: Boys -- control 1:43 seconds, classical 1:54 sec, rock 1:97 sec, rap 2:06 sec; Girls -- control 1:60 sec, classical 1:80 sec, rap 2:14 sec, rock 2:58 sec. Rock and rap affect reaction times as all participants became slower than their control or classical, yet blood pressure increased with all music forms, except classical. Based upon these results, employees in jobs requiring quick reaction times do not need to listen to music while working.

LATERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE HUMAN BODY
Cindy Marie Fulton, Athena Leah Hinkle
Hillsboro High School, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA

“Okay, next I would like you to give me a nice wink.” This was only one of nine questions asked of each of the one hundred twenty five people we interviewed in the pursuit to determine whether there is a relationship between a person’s dominant hand, foot, and eye. Humans naturally hold a preference between which limbs they use the most, ingrained since birth and influenced through injuries and sports training.<br><br> To determine a relationship, we interviewed and tested one hundred twenty five high school students between the ages of thirteen to nineteen. Individually, each test subject was required to first complete a survey covering information concerning height, weight, ethnicity, and personal history. Each test-taker then finished a series of simple tasks designed to pinpoint their dominant limbs. These tests are actions within everyday life that an average person accomplishes with little concentration, such as clapping, crossing their legs, or winking.<br><br> During analysis, each person’s tests and survey responses were evaluated for relationships in limb usage, including any patterns involving ethnicity, height, weight, and personal history. Of the one hundred twenty five people surveyed, twelve responses were discarded due to incomplete surveys or tests. A presence of a lateral relationship for another thirteen could not be determined because of a testing abnormality.<br><br> Of the remaining one hundred tests, a definite relationship was present; eighty five percent of these complete responses contained a lateral relationship. Fifteen responses did not have relationship, due in part to past injuries, sports training, or ambidexterity.<br><br>

GRADING DISORDER A
Chelsea Bahar Gokcay, Julia Ruby Baldwin
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

This year’s project collected grades in order to directly compare student perceptions to student grades and then verify the existence of Grading Disorder A. Grading Disorder A is defined as a syndrome, the characteristics of which include working extremely hard in school and earning above average grades but having a misconception of his/her performance. <br><br>Last year, characteristics of Grading Disorder A were found to exist most prominently in female, high school freshman. However, the disorder had not yet been proved to exist. <br><br>This year, over 1,000 surveys were administered using a number system to insure anonymity. The surveys were redesigned so that they did elicit actual letter grades from both the student and the teacher. Each teacher completed a survey that includes grades for the students; the students completed surveys that revealed what grades they thought they would receive.<br><br>Once the surveys were administered, completed and returned to the researchers, the student surveys were matched up to their corresponding teacher survey. The surveys were then entered as data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. A codebook was designed to represent the data numerically then SPSS (The Statistical Package for Social Sciences) was used for statistical analysis. The data is being analyzed and early results show that Grading Disorder A does indeed exist and is more prominent among female, high school freshman. Further conclusions will identify the causes of the disorder and methods by which to reduce them. <br><br>

PERCEPTION IS REALITY THE EFFECTS OF IMPAIRED VISION
Kristian Robert Montano, Rikesh Chohan
Hillfield-Strathallan College, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

The purpose of this project was to study the effects of the impaired vision produced by DRUNK BUSTERS Impairment Goggles™ on one’s ability to perform basic tasks. The goggles used are designed to simulate the effects alcohol has on vision, but can be correlated to the visual effects of drugs and fatigue.<br><br>The experiment involved three tests on human subjects. Each test was done first with normal vision, and then with the goggles to simulate impaired vision. For the first test, tables were positioned to form a maze. The tests were timed, adding three seconds every time something was touched. In the second test ten small items (quarters, paperclips, etc.) were dropped from 1.5 m off the ground. Subjects were timed as they picked up the items and placed them in a container. The third and final test was to catch a tennis ball ten times, thrown underhand from 2 m.<br><br>The results obtained in the experiment showed that the subjects’ abilities were greatly affected by the impairment goggles. In the first test the times to complete the maze more than doubled (from an average 24 seconds to 56 seconds). In the second test the times also doubled going from an average 14 to 29 seconds. For the final test, the success rate of catching the ball went down from 100% to 53%.<br><br>After the data was collected it was found that if vision is impaired, using the impairment goggles, then the ability to perform basics tasks was greatly reduced.

WHAT IS YOUR PROFILE?
Tiffany Danielle Barrett, Brandon Nicholas Keefer
Lakewood High School, 350 Old Manning Rd. Sumter, SC 29150

The intent of this study was to determine the characteristics of ten subjects by finding each subject’s hemispheric preference and learner type. It was believed that female subjects would have a left hemispheric preference and would be a learner type two or four and male subjects were thought to have a right hemispheric preference and would be a learner type one or three.<br><br> The dominant ear, eye, hand, and foot were found by completing the subject’s DomiKnow. The hemispheric preference was determined by using a muscle test and a standardized test was used to determine the learner type. Three of the male subjects were found to have right hemispheric preference. Five females and two males were found to have left hemispheric preference. One female was found to be learner type one. Two females and a male were found to be learner type two. One male and one female were both found to be learner type three. Two males were found to be learner type four. A female was found to exhibit characteristics of learner type one and two. One male was found to be learner type two and four. The ages of the subjects ranged from eleven to seventeen.<br><br> The results showed that a person’s dominance profile, hemispheric preference, and learner type depends on the person and not their gender or age. Generalizations cannot be made when determining hemispheric preference, learner type or dominance profile of a person; therefore, the hypothesis for this study is rejected based on the data.

THE EFFECTS OF LIVING IN A GROUP ON A MUS MUSCULUS’S LEARNING RATE
Jonathan David Stanley
Fleming Island High School, Orange Park, Florida,United States of America

The purpose of this project is to determine whether mice learn quicker when kept singly or in a group. Five mice should be kept singly and five should be kept in a group. <br><br> To begin, place the bait at the finish point of the maze. Place one mouse at a time in the maze and allow it to finish before entering the next mouse. Record the times of each mouse from the time they start to the time they finish. Repeat the above steps until all ten mice have completed the maze. Repeat this process each day, at the same time of day, until each mouse has run the maze five times.<br><br> The average run time for the mice to complete the maze was calculated in seconds as: Mice kept singly – 69 Mice kept in a group – 57. The overall average time that the mice improved was calculated in seconds as: Mice kept singly – 88 Mice kept in a group – 50.<br><br> The hypothesis was incorrect. The mice recorded a higher average rate of improvement when kept singly than when kept in a group. The mice kept in a group ran the maze quicker than the mice that were kept in solitude. Though the mice that lived in a group could run the maze quicker, the mice that lived by themselves learned better.<br><br>

IMPROVING COGNITIVE FUNCTION AFTER CHRONIC BRAIN INJURY WITH HYPERBARIC OXYGEN
Zarabeth Lehr Golden
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, Florida, United States

The numbers of child and adult survivors of chronic brain injury (CBI) who have significant residual deficits have increased to 2-5% of the population. One suggested treatment for CBI is the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). While there is extensive anecdotal evidence supporting the use of HBOT, there are no well-designed research studies. This research consisted of the comparison of three samples designed to evaluate HBOT. One sample compared new test-retest data of 21 children treated with HBOT against archival test-retest scores of 42 untreated brain-injured and normal controls. The results showed significantly greater improvement in the HBOT treated children on measures of daily living, socialization, communication, and motor skills. Another sample compared 21 newly treated adults against 42 archival untreated adult normal and brain-injured controls. The results showed that the treated adults made significantly greater gains across cognitive areas. These two samples were compared to another sample of archival SPECT data collected in previous years, analyzing the pre and post measures of cerebral metabolism. Overall, the studies were strongly supportive of the use of HBOT as a treatment for lessening the neurological impact of CBI. HBOT resulted in improvement in both the metabolic and cognitive functioning of the brain-injured client. These studies indicate that HBOT can be an effective aid in ameliorating the neuropsychological and physiological effects of CBI in individuals once believed to be untreatable.

AUDITORY VS. VISUAL PERCEPTION: WHICH HAS THE GREATER AFFECT ON A CHILD'S SHORT-TERM MEMORY
Jessica Caroline Stanton
Columbia High School, Lake City, Flordia, United States of America

In past years I have studied the affects of auditory and visual suggestion of a color on taste. I have also tested the affects of age on taste perception. This year I researched a child’s perception of color, visual perception, auditory perception, and a child’s short-term memory. I wanted to find out if visual or auditory suggestion, when in conflict, has the greater affect on a child’s short-term memory when both are used simultaneously. <br><br>I hypothesized that out of 240 trials, 65% of the responses from the child will be a color that they have heard. 25% will be a color that they have seen, and 10% will not remember either color.<br><br>I held up 4 different ‘dolls’ with different color skirts on. The variable is that I did not say the actual color of the skirt. After I held up all of the dolls I asked the child what color skirts the dolls had on. <br><br>The visual perception dominated with 68% being the color that I showed the children. Then the auditory perception with 25% with the children saying the color that I said. Finally, 8% of the responses came from the children who couldn’t remember the color that I told them.<br><br>My hypothesis would have been very close to my results if I had hypothesized the exact opposite. My hypothesis may have been wrong however, it heightened my interest.<br><br>My project could be useful in many ways to anyone dealing with children: teachers, parents, and advertisers.<br><br>

HOW TEACHING STYLES AND COLOR AFFECT LEARNING
Rebecca Jane West
Mills University Studies High School, Little Rock AR, United States

This experiment showed the value of visual learning methods versus auditory learning methods, and also showed the relevance of color when the visual method is used, with regards to a group of fifteen- and sixteen-year-old students with GPAs ranging from 2.5 to 4.0. Three groups of students were chosen to participate. The tests were explained to them, and each of the three tests was performed: ten facts were presented in an auditory manner, a visual manner, and in a manner consistent with a combination of the two. On each test the students was asked to name their age, GPA, favorite color, and sex. This information was used to identify individuals so that test results could be compared. A Chi-Square was used to sort the data and test for significant variations, and each question on the visual tests was color-coded to a fact.<br><br> It was discovered that there were no significant variations in how many students were expected to do better with the auditory or the visual presentation, according to Devlin. The numbers obtained from the Chi-Square formula were well under the limit (5.99) set for 2 degrees of freedom with 95% confidence. Also, it was discovered that, when information was presented visually, 92.8% of students got at least one of the red-coded questions correct, while only 60.7% received points for a correct blue-coded question. <br><br>It was concluded that the observed results were in accordance with what was presented by Devlin, and that red is more conducive to learning. <br><br>

"WHERE DID THEY GO"
Steven Michael Dodson
Drew Central Schools, Monticello, AR, USA

In the past farmers were continually spraying for boll weevils and worms. The spraying of chemicals in the crop fields helped to maintain control of the stinkbug. After the BG Cotton and Boll Weevil Ratification programs there has been less need for spraying of crop fields. This has allowed the stink to dramatically multiply. This in turn has reduced the crop yield and to farmers this has reduced income.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to monitor the feeding and movement patterns of the stinkbug. The hypothesis was the stink bug does not have a particular movement pattern and their food preference is the cotton boll.<br><br> One hundred and thirty-five stinksbugs were selected, noted by gender and numbered on the underside of their abdomen. Each stinkbug was equipped with a diode which was glued with rubber cement on their back. <br><br> The stink bugs were released into a fifty-acre field planted in milo, corn, cotton, soybean and sorghum. A recco tracing device was used to monitor the movement of the stinkbugs from one field to another. They bugs preferred the soybean fields over the cotton field.<br><br> In conclusion there was no particular movement pattern. The stinkbugs will feed at the most available food source, but when the bugs have a choice of food, they prefer soybean.

ETHICS AND TEENS IV: A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AND FACTORS THAT AFFECT ETHICS
Alicia Lynn McDermott
Grace Christian School, Broken Arrow, OK, USA

<br><br>Data from the previous year, regarding the effects of age, gender, race, number of parents in the home, and most influential person on teens’ ethics was analyzed on the largest and most varied test group, including the impact of these variables on the ability to identify troubled teens.<br><br>All the data was transformed into numbers then put into a spreadsheet using Excel. A number of different statistical analyses were performed, including a Correlation analysis, an ANOVA, and a Univariate Analysis (or Interaction) between the different variables. The impact of the newly added variables on the test results was compared to the original set of variables used last year. The variables included this year were; High School, Juvenile Delinquent, Male, Female, Race, Number of Parents in the Home, and Most Influential Person.<br><br>The correlation analysis showed statistical significance in the validated test by revealing that the categories of “Caring”, “Judgmental”, and “Subjective”, created by the student researcher, were valid methods of testing the moral attitudes of youth. The analyses also showed that the new test could accurately predict a troubled male 60% of the time, and a troubled female 73.4% of the time.<br><br>

SECOND LANGUAGE PROCESSING BY ADULT NATIVE SPANISH-SPEAKERS: GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE DECLARATIVE/PROCEDURAL MODEL OF LEXICON AND GRAMMAR
Olivia Andrews Gilliatt
Sleepy Hollow High School, Sleepy Hollow, NY, USA

Grammatical rules are stored in procedural memory; irregularities are memorized in a lexicon in declarative memory. Women rely on the lexicon for some grammatical computations; adult bilinguals do the same in second language. Native Spanish-speakers (13 female, 11 male) were tested on their ability to produce English verbs in past tense. Accuracy was analyzed by gender and biographical factors including Age of Arrival, Length of Exposure, and Years of Education. No significant difference in accuracy existed between men and women, however education predicted performance. Analysis of frequency effects and exclusion of confounding variables is needed to support a sex difference in the Declarative/Procedural model. The potential difference in language acquisition has implications for the teaching of a second language to adult students.

THE EFFECTS OF SERIAL POSITION ON VISUAL WORKING MEMORY RECALL TASKS
Bhargav Katikaneni
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY, U.S.A 

This study examines how the serial position of an object affects its subsequent recall in a visual working memory (VWM) task. A modified change detection paradigm was used in memory trials on 79 subjects to measure recall ability with respect to serial position of visual objects. Correlation measures were performed with four objects individually as well as with two-object combinations. Serial position was found to significantly (p < .001) influence memory retention with subjects making recall errors on certain positions more frequently than on others. A positive correlation was found between serial position of a visual object and misrecall frequency; misrecall was least common for the first object and most common for the final object in a group. A similar trend is evident for double object errors – combinations involving the object first in serial position had a misrecall frequency almost half that of combinations involving later objects. In an extended analysis, accuracy was improved (t-test significance << 0.001) with repetition – non-repeated trials had a misrecall frequency of 0.41 while trials that repeated a memory task reduced it to 0.32. Repetition also significantly altered the effects of serial position on object recall compared to non-repeated trials. Misrecall frequencies for repeated trials showed a trend opposite to that of previous research on verbal memory where primacy and recency were significant. For repeated information, subjects in this study were better able to recall visual objects closer to the middle in a presented object group while at the same time having difficulty recalling objects in the initial and final serial positions. These findings provide a model for ordered presentation of objects to maximize recall ability for visual information.<br><br>

RACIAL BIAS BY PHYSICIANS PROVIDING PRENATAL CARE
Tamiko Bianca Younge
White Plains High School, White Plains, NY, USA

Nowhere in the United Sates are the divisions of race more prevalent than in racial inequities in health. Black women are twice as likely to deliver preterm compared to white women. This has a profound impact on perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preterm birth presents an enigma to the medical community; the causes of half of preterm births are unknown and traditional explanations of socioeconomics and behavioral characteristics do not explain the excess rate of preterm birth among African Americans. Previous studies have shown that a patient’s race can affect their clinical management, but whether it is a contributing factor to the racial disparity of preterm birth has not been adequately investigated. Physicians providing prenatal care were surveyed to determine their knowledge, attitudes and intended clinical management related to racial disparities in maternal and infant health. Physicians were aware of some racial disparities in perinatal health. However, reported clinical management was influenced by patient race. Responses also differed based on the characteristics of the physician. Findings suggest the need for cultural sensitivity training for physicians to enhance equity of care and minimize the provider contribution to the racial disparity of preterm birth.

ANIMAL COMPANIONSHIP AS A FACTOR IN ADOLESCENT SCHOOL PERFORMANCE
Laura Joy Fitzpatrick
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, USA

Attachment to a companion animal and school performance were measured among a sample of 107 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, from a diverse high school in suburban New York. Respondents completed a questionnaire composed of the Companion Animal Bonding Scale as well as eleven questions about aspects of adolescent life, including involvement in extracurricular activities (ECI) and twelve questions regarding demographics. Participants’ responses to Kohlberg’s “Heinz and the Druggist” dilemma were analyzed using a Moral Reasoning Grammar. Each subject's cumulative grade point average (GPA) for the year in which the testing took place was also obtained. In Non-Owners, time spent home alone after school was inversely related to GPA; this was not true of Owners. In all Owners, time per day spent in a room with a companion animal was significantly positively related to ECI. In females only, attachment to pets was positively related to ECI. In African-Americans only, number of pets could be used to predict GPA. Other significant results were found in the general population, in females, and in nonwhites of both genders. There was no significant relationship between animal companionship and strategies of moral reasoning. These findings indicate strong associations between animal companionship and school performance, especially for females and racial minorities.

THE EFFECT OF VOLTAGE ON PARAMECIUM BEHAVIOR
Kristina Gvozdjan
Centreville High School, Clifton, VA, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the behavior of paramecium changes as a result of electric shocks of different magnitude. It was hypothesized that higher voltages cause the paramecium to swim slower. <br><br> Times that take paramecia to travel the distance of 2 mm at different voltages were recorded. The results were obtained from 5 different water cultures of Paramecium caudatum, each pretreated with 4 different voltage current (0v, 50v, 100v, and 125v). The electric shocks (2 seconds in length) were applied in 10 minute intervals. Besides descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Post-hoc statistical tests were used. The results showed that 50v electric shock does not influence the paramecium to take more time to travel the given distance than the control group. 100v, as well as 125v shocks, caused the paramecium to take significantly more time to travel the given distance, compared to the 50v shocks and to the negative control (p<0.0001). <br><br> Behavioral modifications, including observed frequent changes in swimming direction and collisions, affected the time required for paramecia to travel the given distance. It seems that increase in voltage, causes a significant prolongation of the interval that paramecium needs to travel the given length, especially at higher voltages. The further research should determine the minimal voltage that causes behavioral deviation. <br><br>

Each year, thousands of teenagers in high school are required to take part in standardized testing. These tests, (i.e. the SATs), supposedly measure students' successful intelligence. These tests become a basis for entering college and may determine the ultimate outcome of those students' academic success in life.<br><br>According to psychologist Robert J. Sternberg, standardized tests are limited in scope and measure two forms of intelligence: logical and linguistic. Another independent form of intelligence, practical intelligence, is also required to obtain a successful intelligence level. A test was created to ascertain any possible correlation between the three intelligences, possibly supporting either Sternberg or his opponents. A sampling of high school students received and completed self-reported tests, whose results were completely anonymous. These results were then compared to mathematical [logical] and verbal [linguistic] percentiles from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills.<br><br>Analysis of the standard deviation validated no direct correlation between greater linguistic and logical intelligence levels and greater practical intelligence levels. Results support Sternberg's theory that all three intelligences are independent. Therefore, standardized testing measures only two of the three intelligences and is partially ineffective. All research followed APA Research Ethics.<br><br>

HOW DOES LEARNING MODALITY PREDICT SAT SCORES?
Ilang Mae Guiroy
York School, Monterey CA, U. S. A.

The objective of this study was to discover if students who are of a certain learning modality would perform higher on the SAT than others. The modalities are visual, auditory, and tactile/kinesthetic. The experiment devised in order to discover this, is a power point presentation containing slides on which characters from the Katakana and Ndujka alphabets are presented to stimulate learning in the three modalities. <br><br> <br><br> It was found that students with upper range SAT scores were multimodal. Students with upper midrange and lower midrange SAT scores were highly modal, having a very large preference for the visual mode. Students with low range SAT scores were found to be less modal.<br><br> The upper range SAT scorers were either naturally multimodal or learned to cope very well, making it easier for them to understand material presented in class, and later asked of them on the SAT. Students with midrange SAT scores were probably visual learners who did not need to learn how to cope quite as much. Students with low range SAT scores were probably highly modal, but learned to cope, but not as well as students in the upper range.<br><br> Students learn best in different ways. If classes could be taught to benefit all the students, performance would improve and comprehension of the material would increase.

SYMBOLS OF CIRCLE IN THE WORLD CIVILIZATION AND THE SAKHA NATIONAL CULTURES
Kristina Mikhailovna Sitnikova
Sakha – Belgian Gymnasium, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia

The paper deals with the regularities of reflection in the circle image the symbols of religions and mythological world outlooks of the east and the west in order to find the deep bases of the statement of conciliation and harmony in the modern world full of religions contradictions. The author studies the nation of symbol and its appearance in the circle image since the most ancient times up to our days. By means of the historical-comparative analysis the essence of the symbolic meaning of the circle image, the ancient symbol of the centre and the world are disclosed. In the world civilization experience the divided circle in the form of a wheel symbolizes the eternal motion around the fixed axis, the circle image existed in the medieval myths about Atlantida and Shambala, in the legend of King Arthur as the symbol of Dream about Peace and Happiness. The modern notion of “a round table” the symbol of democracy and confidence in the modern business world goes back to the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In author’s opinion, the penetration into the intellectual depth of the circle image, uncover of the religions shells and disclosure of its symbolic content expressing the idea of harmony with the surrounding world and the Universe will help to arrange in order the conscience of a modern civilized individual. The author tries to understand the most complex philosophical problems disclosing the social, cultural and engineering correlations. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF BILINGUALISM ON LANGUAGE-SELECTIVE OR LANGUAGE-NONSELECTIVE ACCESS
Julia A. Hornaday
Central High School, St. Joseph, MO, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the bilingual experience occurs through a process of language-selective (LS) or language-nonselective (LNS) access. LS access occurs when reading a homograph (words spelled the same, but different meanings) in one language leads to the selective access of its lexical system. LNS access occurs when the reading of a homograph leads to the access of multiple lexical systems. It was hypothesized that bilinguals would not use LS access. This was tested by use of an original computer program composed of two parts. The first was a personal survey asking background information about the test subject including language experience. The second was a three-phase test using interlexical homographs. In phase one the homographs were presented without context, phase two in English context, and phase three in Spanish context. Averages for the number of answers and response times in Spanish and English with and without context were determined. The averages were analyzed statistically using independent variable t-tests and ANOVA. The results showed that without context, both lexicons could simultaneously be accessed. It was therefore concluded that LNS was being utilized. However, with the influence of context, subjects responses indicated LS access. It was also shown that interlexical interference was caused when primary language prevents the access of the less experienced lexicon.

NEUROCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE AND COCAINE ON PERIADOLESCENT AND ADULTS RATS
Jennifer Alicia Ledon
Dr. Michael M Krop Senior High, Miami Florida, USA

Tobacco use is prevalent in the adolescent populations and is a major concern because tobacco is highly addictive and is linked with illicit drug use. Little research is available on the interaction between nicotine and other stimulant drugs in animal models. This tissue study examined the effects of chronic nicotine alone and on cocaine-stimulated activity in male periadolescent rats compared to male adult rats. Neurochemical analysis was begun by slicing from the nucleus acumbens and caudate putamen and then mounting them on gelatin/chromate coated slides that will be stored at -70 degrees Celsius prior to Dopamine Transporter and Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor assays. After which, slides and standards were apposed to radiosensitive film and a Macintosh-based image analysis system, a one-way ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference (PLSD) were used. This study revealed increased dopamine transporter densities in adolescents. Adult rats did not show significant change, implying that they do not take part in nicotine and cocaine sensitization. Consequently, it may be that nicotine use during adolescence carries a greater risk than during adulthood and that adolescent may be particularly vulnerable to the risk of cocaine abuse after nicotine use. This information should be taken into account so as to help us better understand the development of drug addiction in adolescents compared to adults.

THE STROOP EFFECT
Alyssa Marie Jensen
Carson High School, Carson City NV, United States of America

My experiment, “The Stroop Effect,” will determine if it is more difficult for teenagers to look past the written color of a word (such as the word “purple” written in green ink) or the written placement of a word (such as the word “right” written below a box). I believe it will be more difficult for teenagers to look past the written placement of a word. I will complete this experiment by performing a two-part test on numerous teenagers. <br><br> The first part of the experiment tests subjects' response time to word colors. Subjects will first complete two sets of fifteen word color cards -- a control sample (words printed in the same color named by the word) and a test sample (words printed in a color different from that named by the word). The subject will be timed in how long it takes to name the words on each set of fifteen cards. Each time will be recorded on a chart under COLOR TEST as "Control" and "Test" times.<br><br> The second part of the experiment tests subjects' response time to word placement (the words "right," "left," "top" and "bottom" written around a box). The subject will be asked to complete two sets of fifteen word placement cards -- a control sample (words printed in the same placement named by the word) and a test sample (words printed in a placement different from that named by the word -- for example, the word "top" printed to the right of the box). The subject will be timed in how long it takes to complete each sample, and those times will be recorded under PLACEMENT TEST as "Control" and "Test" times.

THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC TYPES ON DRIVING ABILITY
Rebecca Elizabeth Wilder
Mentor High School, Mentor, Ohio, U.S.A.

This project explores the effects of different types of music listened to on driving ability. In 1998, 14% of all fatal car accidents killed 6,300 teens between the ages of 15 and 19. Since only 7% of all drivers are teenagers, they are responsible for twice as many fatal accidents as all other drivers. This experiment is an attempt to show that if teens listen to loud, aggressive music rather than soft, relaxing music, then they will be involved in more car accidents. To test this, 50 teens will listen to rock music, country music, and no music while driving in a simulator and their number of crashes while listenening to each CD will be recorded and analyzed. According to Hotz, "[...] a piece of music might elicit a certain behavior one time, such as dancing, and something different another time, such as smiling when remembering a dance" (2002). What people listen to sparks an emotion, which can change their mood. If this is true, then when a person hears a song, their entire mood will change and subsequently, the way they drive will change. If it is found that music causes teens to drive more aggressively, then many fatal car accidents could be avoided by making teens listen to soft relaxing music instead of loud, aggressive music.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS
Antonio Javier Pietrantoni
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this investigation is to contribute knowledge to the scientific community and to provide a new angle to dealing with Breast cancer patients and survivors and their Quality of Life. Among Hispanic Breast cancer patients and survivors there is a limited amount of knowledge regarding their HRQOL. It was hypothesized that QOL was affected by the educational level, civil status and treatment of a patient and that survivors would have a better QOL than patients. The FACT-B, designed by Dr. Cella, a HRQOL questionnaire for Breast cancer patients was administered. The variables were then scored, measured and analyzed using scales provided by FACIT. The HRQOL score of patients was 106.88, a High Medium score, survivors scored a High score of 117.62. Hispanic women have a High Social Scale HRQOL possibly because Hispanic women are affected in Emotional terms by their disease and look for support in contacts or groups. The Physical and Functional Scales had no significant difference in score. Patients who received Chemotherapy, Radiation and Combination had a lower QOL than Survivors, indicating that the side effects of the treatment give way to a better QOL in the future. Patients who received Tamoxifen ,whose side effects are long-term, had a higher QOL than Survivors. In Hispanic Breast cancer patients, the HRQOL does not solely depend on the effects of treatments, civil status and education, but, on the perception and coping capabilities experience has given them.

HOW DOES LEARNING SIGN LANGUAGE AFFECT PERCEPTION?
Elizabeth Rose Kolod
Midwood High School, Brooklyn, NY, USA

Everyone uses emotional facial expressions, but people who sign American Sign Language (ASL) use a different kind of facial expressions as an essential part of the language. Does all of this signing affect perception? To determine whether learning ASL has an effect on visual discrimination, deaf signers, hearing signers and hearing non-signers were tested with three groups of faces: emotional facial expressions, linguistic ASL facial expressions and faces of different people. The deaf observers perform half as well as hearing signers for all stimuli. When compared to the efficiencies of hearing non-signers, these results show that learning ASL improves visual discrimination and being deaf impairs it. The observers who know ASL perform best with linguistic facial expressions. Thus, learning ASL improves one’s ability to identify facial expressions.

WHICH COLOR HAS THE FASTEST REACTION TIME?
Tiana Monique Woitas
Loyola High School - Mankato, MN - United States

For my hypothesis, I predicted that Yellow would be the color with the fastest reaction time because of it's brightness. However, I did still have strong feelings towards the colors of Red and Orange because I discovered through much of my research that Red was a color known to express boldness and excitement, and orange standing less aggressive than Red, but still a color to create the feeling of energy.<br><br> For my procedure, I tested each of my subjects with a total of 24 sets that determined which color had the fastest reaction time. I used 4 different colored ping pong balls (Red, Yellow, Orange and Green) that would be released from my "machine" one at a time. After my subject was correctly positioned sitting, he/she was instructed that once I released a colored ping pong ball down my machine, they would attempt to catch the colored ping pong ball once the visualized it release from the bottom of my machine, with a total of 8 releases catching with their right hand, 8 releases catching with their left, as well as 8 releases catching with both hands. I would time each of my subject's reaction times with my stopwatch, starting the timer when I released each ball, and stopping the watch once my subject made any type of movement towards each colored ball they visualized. I tested a total of 40 subjects.<br><br> In conclusion then, I disproved my original hypothesis. Red overall was the color with the fastest reaction time. Orange stood in between, coming in as the color with the second fastest reaction time. The colors both Yellow and Green evened out to be the colors on the bottom of my list with the slowest reaction times.

The following research analyses the effects of the Internet in the family. The hypothesis postulates that the use of Internet affects family relations if it is not used properly or under responsible supervision. To develop this research, a survey was done using a questionnaire.<br><br>There was a reasonable and representative number of families who have the service of Internet. The questionnaires were analyzed and the families were compared in terms of the effect, if any, that have occurred among them due to the use of Internet.<br><br>Once the facts were abridged, other studies related to the theme were analyzed to support the facts obtained. The data was organized into tables and graphs.<br><br>According to the results, the conclusion was that the Internet affects family relations in a negative way if it is not used properly or under a responsible supervision.

ACOUSTIC CONFUSIONS IN IMMEDIATE MEMORY
Courtney Michelle Howard
Jefferson High School, Lafayette, Indiana, United States

I tested Purdue University students using an identity test and a memory recall test. The students were all native American English speakers, eighteen to twenty-one years of age. Miller Nicely I tested the students’ ability to recall syllables that the students heard over a microphone with a white background noise that distorted the recorded speaker. Miller Nicely II orally presented a set of five syllable clusters that were to be recalled in order at the end of the voiced recording over white background noise.<br><br> I formed confusion matrixes and multidimensional scales that visually represented the correlation between the identity and the memory recall. I was able to see the proportion correct and the proportion of errors performed on both tests individually and the overall average of all twenty-four students, with the importance put on individual results. The results will help link information to reasons of mature memory loss. <br><br><br>

THE CHIMPANZEE (PAN TROGLODYTES) VOCALIZATION PROJECT REDISCOVERING A LOST FORM OF COMMUNICATION
Elizabeth (Liz) Anne Baker
University High School, 422 N. Arcadia Blvd, Tucson, AZ USA 85711

Over a four-month period of time, the vocalizations of sixteen captive chimpanzees were observed. Reliability in the identification of the types of vocalization was ensured through a two-year registered training program. Using the only established chimpanzee data collection instrument resulted in a total of 960 data points.. Because there were limitations in the established instrument, a more descriptive qualitative system for documenting vocalizations was adapted. Both the quantitative and qualitative data were compared to a worldwide database of 44,762 chimpanzee data points.<br><br><br> An analysis of the data revealed that chimpanzees in the selected population vocalize in ways that were never before recognized. The vocalizations were significant at the 0.000000003 level. Out of the 581 vocalizations, Pant Hoots and Bronx Cheers were significant at the .05 level. In addition, five previously unidentified vocalizations were detected. Chimpanzees that vocalized the longest per hour were the oldest and only wild-caught chimpanzees (Bonnie 11.67% and Toto 9.33%), and, interestingly, the one who vocalized the shortest was the nationally famous, Gracie (0.35%), who continuously escapes. There were 69 absent vocalizations in emotional situations refuting the common belief that chimpanzee vocalizations stem only from their limbic system, not the language center, on the brain. <br><br><br> It is clear that chimpanzees vocalize far more than previously imagined. Two vocalizations are particularly significant to their communication. Researchers can no longer assume that all vocalizations have been identified since a new type of vocalizations was discovered. This study established a baseline for current research and a mandate for future studies.<br><br> <br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL THOUGHT
Casey King Hogle
Elko High School, Elko, NV, United States

Does the development of political thought (both patriotism and basic American principles) in children and adolescents become more sophisticated with age? Can this development be related to Lawrence Kohlberg's model of moral development? I hypothesized that the stages of sophistication would increase with age. A questionnaire and categorization rubric corresponding to Kohlberg's six stages of moral development were created. Two classes in each third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth grade (a total of 94 people) were tested.<br><br> The mean of the responses (categorized into stages) of each grade increased. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a statistical difference between the grades for all the questions and when comparing just the questions dealing with basic American principles. The latter difference may be because of increased political socialization and familiarity with those principles. No statistical difference was shown with the questions dealing with patriotism. That may result from increased familiarity with patriotism in younger children. <br><br> Testing the correlation coefficient for inter-rater reliability indicated that when a sample of responses was categorized separately by three people, the different peoples' categorizations were statistically correlated. T-testing showed no statistical difference between genders.<br><br> The general trend confirmed by ANOVA agrees with my hypothesis. The statistically significant correlation indicates that my questionnaire and categorization rubric are a viable and usable measurement of political thought. Kohlberg's stages of moral development can be used as a blueprint for the development of similar stages of political development that advance with age.<br><br>

MYTH AND ERGON IN KOM AND WICHI INDIANS. THE PAST SURVIVES IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT
Lucrecia Cecilia Teran
Colegio Pablo Apostol, Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina

Two ethnic groups of different linguistic families and origin, the Wichi and the Kom indians, stand out in the Argentine Chaco ecoregion. In this project I applied the ethnologic approach to analysed the similarities and discrepancies in their adaptive systems, and I took their myths and ergons as relevant dimensions of their spiritual and economic life in connection with the natural world.<br><br> By applying participant observation, focalised groups, non guided interviews and analysis of contents, I present as my contribution the explanation of the differences and similarities between these ethnos by cultural borrowings, internal movements, historic trajectory and restructuring of myths. In the Wichi the adaptive system is influenced by a humorous narrative strategy, while in the Kom the mythic structure predominates. This difference may explain why Kom indians can better face the conflicts caused by the transformation of their environment, migration to cities and their new life styles.<br><br> I conclude that culture is not only accumulated patrimony, it is a wider dimension of answers to questions about man's personal and collective sense in the cosmos, his identification with nature through myths and ergons that grant dignity, identity and human sense to each ethnic group.<br><br> I propose a programe of educative, social and economic development based on cultural recovery and aborigines protagonism wich will allow the incorporation of the Kom and Wichi ethnos to the life of the country in their own interactive space.

INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EYEWITNESS FACIAL IDENTIFICATION
Elisabeth Lee Crabtree
Byng High School, Ada Oklahoma, USA

Eyewitness identification of a suspect is an influential factor in criminal investigations. The purpose of this project was to determine if eyewitness age, gender, race, or written descriptions after seeing a face affect identification of the face in sequential and lineup viewing. Twelve male faces--six Caucasian and six African American--were created using a computer program. One hundred twenty subjects in each of three age groups (9-12, 14-18, and 21 years and older) with equal numbers of males and females viewed the target face, followed by half the subjects writing a description of the face. The target face was ordered differently in three groups of six faces--two sequential and one lineup--for identification.<br><br> The largest numbers of incorrect responses were from the youngest subjects, especially those who did not write descriptions, which does not support the theory of verbal overshadowing of visual memory. Both younger age groups made more mistakes identifying the African American face. A split-split-plot factorial ANOVA showed significant effects based on subject age (p<.005), whether they wrote descriptions (.01<p<.025), the target face race (p<.005), and the interaction between subject age and target face race (p<.025). These factors should be considered during forensic investigations.

BATTLE OF THE SEXES
Tracy M. Autenrieth
Boone Grove High School, Valparaiso, IN

The purpose of this project was to determine which gender, male or female, would more quickly and accurately perceive emotions as shown on the human face. It was hypothesized that females would be able to recognize emotions in a shorter time and have a higher accuracy rate when compared to males.<br><br>Fifty males and fifty females were randomly selected to participate in this study. Each subject viewed a series of twenty photographs of human faces exhibiting different emotions. Participants selected the appropriate emotion from a list of five choices. The total time for completion of each test was recorded. Averages were calculated for both accuracy and for the time required to complete the test for each group.<br><br>Analysis of the data indicated that females and males were about equal in their ability to identify the emotions (females 89%, males 87.8%). Although females on average were able to complete the test in a shorter period of time (female average 47 seconds, male average 51 seconds), statistical analysis using a t-test failed to show a significant difference at the 95% confidence level. Thus, the results of this research failed to support the hypothesis.<br><br>

THE PEER PRESSURE EFFECT
Cristina Maria Costantini
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee WI, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to measure the degree to which peer pressure affects eighth grade students.<br><br>In order to assess the effects of peer pressure on eighth graders, the true intent of the project was not revealed to the test subjects, and was presented in the form of a math test. The individual test subjects were verbally presented with fifteen basic math problems to solve mentally. Each test subject was then told that he or she would take an identical test with a group of three other test subjects. In reality, these three other subjects were "plants", instructed to intentionally give the wrong answers. The "plants" always gave their answers first, and afterwards the test subject was asked for the answer. The purpose of this test was to evaluate the percentage of times that the test subjects would give the wrong answers to conform with the wrong answers given by the group.<br><br>Peer pressure was found to be a very strong force in these subjects. The range of data was great, spanning from those test subjects who never gave in to peer pressure, to those who gave in to peer pressure ninety percent of the time.<br><br>This test could be used in practical life situations to assess one's suseptibility to peer pressure. If a person could be so influenced by peer pressure in a subject as concrete as math, imagine how they could be affected in the more subjective situations that they confront in their every day life.<br><br>

LIVING MEMORY
Elias Queiroz de Oliveira Junior
EMEF José maria Lisboa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil

This research concerns recovering Jardim da Saúde’s neighborhood and Escola Municipal José Maria Lisboa’s history from the memory of the people who live there. <br><br>Studying the reality that is close to the student, it’s the starting point for an investigation about the world that surrounds us and will serve as a fundamental point to develop history concepts, essential to the comprehension of our reality. The student is an active player in the learning process, building his own knowledge, and noticing that they are actors in history; they are active citizens in the social process.<br><br>Therefore, retelling Jardim da Saúde’s neighborhood’s history, started by studying the population movements (the first residents, immigration, emigration). From this point, the research got more meaningful, by analyzing other aspects following the subsequent steps:<br><br>1st– Gathering data from Official Sources (number of habitants, number of houses, buildings and other establishments built, etc.);<br><br>2nd–Reading and examining possible sources about the neighborhood’s history (newspapers, magazines, websites);<br><br>3rd– Compilation and Examination of visual documents, such as photographs, maps, blueprints, etc;<br><br>4th– Checking and Examining actual cultural legacy: Church, houses and also the school;<br><br>5th– Reading Historical Texts;<br><br>6th– Composing a text about the neighborhood’s history;<br><br>7th– Developing a Power Point presentation with all the data collected.<br><br>

MORE TO READING THAN MEETS THE EYE
Carrie Ann Kreimier
Rifle High School, Rifle, Colorado, USA

<br><br> Reading is an important part of learning. It is much more than just looking at words on a page. Reading works your bilateral coordination, visual tracking skills, and auditory pronunciation. Not all skills come quickly to all students.<br><br> The problem presented is: Which combination of auditory, bilateral coordination, or visual tracking activities will improve a student's reading score? There were three activities presented in combinations, to eight, second grade classes. In the study there were a total of 168 students. The hypothesis stated that the class performing all three activities will have the greatest improvement, and then the classes performing two activities will have the next highest improvement, and then the classes performing only one activity will have the least highest improvement.<br><br> The results didn't match the hypothesis. Of the three activities, and eight classes, the class that performed only visual tracking activity had the greatest improvement, with a class average of 7.43 Rigby level benchmark scores. Rigby is a program that measures a student's reading level. One reason that the project may have been affected was the consistency in performing the activities. The teacher who performed all three activities was absent from school on various occasions. If the teacher was gone, the substitue may not have presented the activities, or presented them wrong. <br><br> An important finding was: All but one class showed greater improvement than the control, supporting the idea that these activities could be used as a daily warm-up to stimulate and enhance reading.

CONTINUED LUNACY 2003-2004 THE AFFECTS OF THE FULL MOON ON HUMAN (CRIMINAL) BEHAVIOR
Christine Jamie Bedont
Carbon High School, Price, Utah USA

The purpose of my science fair project is to continue the research started last year which proves a change in human behavior with the full moon. To complete this project, I expanded my research to include rural Carbon County and urban Salt Lake County and cities located in each county. I collected data on criminal activity on my control date and the date of the full moon each month during the year 2003 from several public safety agencies within these areas. The agencies involved were Price City Police Department, Helper City Police Department, Price City Fire Department, Carbon County Sheriff’s Office, Salt Lake City Police Department, South Salt Lake City Police Department, Salt Lake County Fire Department and Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office. I counted each call/report from each agency for each date and calculated the percent of change from the control date to the full moon date. The results from each department showed a rise in criminal activity on the date of the full moon. This data again proved my hypothesis correct both in rural and urban areas.<br><br> Each agency also participated in a survey to obtain their personal opinions of whether or not the full moon theory of behavioral change was believed. From these surveys, I ascertained that most believed in the phenomenon but no agency planned on any extra personnel to be working on those nights. The percent of change found with the data would support this decision.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF VISUAL IMAGES AND POWER PHRASES ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO A HUNGER PREVENTION CHARITY
Michael Jason Sloyer
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY, United States

The last few years have been financially difficult for American charities. This experiment explored the relative efficacy of different charitable appeals in persuading individuals to make donations to a hunger prevention organization. It was hypothesized that advertisements containing either a happy or sad photograph of a child would be more effective than advertisements without any visual image and that advertisements containing a power phrase, either “Even a penny will help” or “You can make a difference,” would be more effective than advertisements without any power phrase. Nine advertisements, using all possible combinations of the two independent variables (picture and phrase), soliciting donations for a hunger prevention charity were created. Four hundred and fifty adults were randomly presented with one of the nine appeals and asked for a donation. Chi square analyses revealed that happy and sad pictures were significantly more effective in increasing the rate of donation than were appeals without pictures, but an ANOVA indicated that there was no statistical difference in average contribution size. Additional chi square tests showed that “Even a penny will help” was significantly more effective than both “You can make a difference” and the no phrase condition in increasing the rate of donation; the ANOVA demonstrated that neither phrase impacted the average contribution size. Possible explanations for and implications of these findings are discussed.

MODELING PRESIDENTIAL CHARACTER: INSTITUTIONAL AND NON-INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS
Jarett Scott Goldman
Syosset High School, Syosset, NY, United States of America

The office of the presidency allows its occupants to express more of their character than almost any other public office. That’s why it’s no stretch to say that there is no topic in the study of the presidency that is the culprit of more debate than the analysis of presidential character and how it may affect performance in the White House. This study focused on the expression of previous President’s character, as classified by James David Barber, and how it relates to their legislative relations with Congress. Barber specifically distinguished between four types of presidential character: active-positive; active-negative; passive-positive; and passive-negative. They are respectively described as adaptive, compulsive, compliant, and withdrawn. A Presidential-Congressional relations model was first devised by analyzing variables that contribute to different types of relations. Then, using the discriminant analysis test, different measures of the variables were assigned to different character traits. The discriminant analysis test specially developed three functions that were used to obtain overall discriminant scores, which were eventually used to develop group centroids. Finally, the mahalanobis distance, the distance between the discriminant score and the group centroid for each function, was assessed in order to determine which group a future President would be classified in. The discriminant model was proven to be statistically valid by additional analysis that was completed. This model marks an enormous advance because for the first time it adds a quantitative aspect to a historically qualitative field and will hopefully serve a bridge between these two often-conflicting areas of study.

COUNTING FEATURES: QUANTIFYING DISCRETE PARTS IN VISUAL OBJECT IDENTIFICATION
Henny Admoni
J. L. Miller Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY, USA

People visually detect simple gratings, made of alternating bars of black and white, by detecting the bars independently. More generally, it seems that the visual identification of ordinary objects is based upon the independent detection of several features: discrete components of the image that are detected independently of each other (Robson and Graham, 1981; Pelli, Farell, and Moore, 2003). However, the number of features we use to identify a complex image remains unknown. Assuming that identification requires the detection of a certain number of features, and that features are detected independently over time, the probability of identification will grow as a binomial function at a rate determined solely by the number of features required. Thus, measuring the proportion of correct identifications as a function of duration should reveal the number of features used by the observer. The accuracy of this method was confirmed in specific cases where the number of features used was already known, and successfully applied to key examples of the general case.

ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATION ON HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY IN RURAL AFRICA
Megan Lakshmi Srinivas
Fort Dodge Senior High, Fort Dodge, Iowa, United States

The magnificent African continent is faced with many dilemmas, and lack of household food security is one of them. In the current study thirty Kenyan farmers were selected and interviewed to understand the role of education in improving the farmers household food security. The study results indicated a direct link between the formal education and the farmer’s success. The adoption and practice of advanced agriculture technologies efficient in controlling weed/pest problem(s) and increasing yields of maize and other crops are found to be directly linked to the educational levels of the individual farmers. Although 100% of the interviewed farmers identified malaria as a major health threat, but only highly educated farmers were willing to admit and discuss HIV/AIDS, the leading cause of death, creating numerous hungry orphans. The study results also indicated the farmer’s success depends on how well the females, the main working individuals of the family, are educated and informed about the advanced agricultural technologies and health issues. Based on the current study results the following eight recommendations have been made to attain household food and health security success: 1) education, both formal and practical must be provided to all; 2) agricultural aid must be extended to all; 3) women must be empowered; 4) myths and misconceptions must be fought; 5) farmers’ financial acumens must be increased; 6) nutritional education needs to be given; 7) an awareness of regional health issues must be created; and 8) African governments need to play more active roles in supporting their citizens.

GPS NAVIGATION MEANS OF TRAVEL FOR THE BLIND
Ameen Abdulrasool
Lane Technical High School, Chicago, IL., U.S.A.

In modern society independent travel is a prerequisite for both success in education and employment. Navigation for the visually impaired not only involves finding a safe route for travel but landmarks for orientation as well. This experiment examined the effectiveness of a satellite navigation system when used to help the blind navigate.<br><br> A satellite navigational tool was adapted for the blind using a Global Positioning System (GPS) along with a compact flash adapter and a personal digital assistant (PDA). An obstacle course was created and a comparison was made between the use of memorized directions and the use of directions given by the navigation system, in which the errors made and the course completion time of 18 individuals subjected through the course was measured and analyzed.<br><br> It was concluded that the GPS navigational tool adapted for the blind helped the blind navigate more efficiently in comparison to their conventional techniques. The mean errors committed with the navigational tool were 1.67 with a mean completion time of 23.42 minutes; as compared to the 3.44 mean errors committed with a mean completion time of 33.07 minutes without the navigational tool, thus saving 1.77 errors and 9.65 minutes on the course. <br><br>

MUSIC: CONNECTING TWO WORLDS TOGETHER
Alicia Marie Baumgartner
Strasburg Public High, Strasburg, North Dakota, United States

The objective of this project was to teach kindergartners how to count from 1-10 in Spanish and 5 other simple Spanish words through the use of music. Also, to see if the children will respond to the music allowing them to use another sense (other then visual) while learning. Each Spanish number (1-10) and each new word was then given a note on the keyboard to match. Half of the class was exposed to the music while the other half was not.<br><br>The students were introduced to the Spanish in the same day and immediately quizzed on how many they could recall. For the music students, the matching note was played when exposed to the visual and while trying to recall them. <br><br> All numbers and words were then reviewed with the students once and they were asked to recall as many as possible. The students were then asked to recall the numbers and words without any review. Again the music was played for the music group. Then without any review or music, the Spanish words and numbers were recited in Spanish and the students were asked to act as translators and respond correctly in English. Finally, all the students were together and given a written/oral test. The Spanish numbers were called off in a random order and students were asked to write down the correct number. Each student also received 5 cards with the pictures drawn on them. The words were called off one at a time and the students were suppose to put the card containing that picture face down on their desk and the next card on top and continue with the pattern. In all tests that were conducted individually with each student, the music students were able to recall more numbers and words. In the final number test without any music, those previously exposed to it still averaged higher scores then the students without the music. All students received a perfect score when tested on the Spanish words using the 5 flash cards.<br><br>

CAN KILLDEER PREDICT RAIN?
Krista Marie Vogel
Kulm High School, Kulm, North Dakota, U.S.A.

The purpose of this project was to determine if killdeer could predict rain, how accurate they were, and how their predictions compared to those of three different weather forecasts.<br><br> The hypothesis was that the killdeer would be correct 80% of the time.<br><br> Each day, from May 31st until August 15th, data was recorded. The data included days the killdeer sang, days it rained, and the predictions of three weather forecasts' for each day. After calculating the results, it was determined that the killdeer had an overall accuracy of 84%. This was calculated allowing the killdeer a two-day period for it to rain after they sang. This is because of the weather lore. It states that if you hear the killdeer sing, it will rain within 24-48 hours. Weather.com (The Weather Channel) had an accuracy of 86%, which was 2% better than the killdeer's predictions. KFYR was at 78% accuracy, and Dish Instant Weather (sponsored by AccuWeather.com) was 74% accurate. The killdeer predicted 32 of the 34 rains that occurred during those two and a half months, but they also called 10 times when it never rained. The hypothesis was nearly accurate, and it can be concluded that it is fairly accurate to say, "If you hear the killdeer sing, it will rain within the next day."

The purpose of this experiment was to find out whether or not there are similarities in the fingerprints of different generations of a family and if the percentage compared with the general populations percentage were similar. <br><br> I took fingerprints of nine different people from three different families. I used only their right hand. I classified them into main categories and compared the different generations of prints.<br><br> Between subjects 1m61, 2m35, and 3m2, there was a total of one double loop, one tented arch seven radial loops, three loops, one ulnar loop, one whorl, and one plain whorl. Overall they had mostly loops.<br><br> Between subjects 1f60, 2f38, and 3f10, there were four ulnar loops, two plain whorls, four loops, and five radial loops. The second and third generations of this family had a form of loop on all their fingers.<br><br> Between subjects 1f81, 2f44, and 3f16, there were a total of five radial loops, three ulnar loops, one loop, one whorl, one tented arch, one accidental whorl, and three plain whorls. This family was interesting because they had such a variety of prints. The first and third generations were more closely related to each other than 2f44 was to either of them.<br><br> I have concluded from my observations that there are definite similarities between the prints of different generations of a family. Overall 76% of the families together have loops, 20% have whorls, and 4% have arches.<br><br>

JACK OR JILL - WHO RECALLS THE FALL?
Lindsey Ann Rafferty
Beach High School, Beach, ND, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if gender identity plays a part in a child's short term memory. I wanted to see if boys remember more masculine things as compared to feminine things and vice versa. I also wanted to see if the number of gender neutral items they remembered were comparable.<br><br> To determine this I tested second, fourth, sixth and eighth grade males and females. I showed them fifteen flashcards, and had them write down the objects they remembered after they had looked at all the flashcards. There were five feminine, five masculine, and five neutral items. I calculated the results by finding the percentage of items they remembered.<br><br> I found that gender identity does play a role in the memory of children in the fact that they generally remembered more of the items associated with their gender than the items not specifically associated with their gender. I found that this trend decreases with age, and the subjects began to recall more items not associated with their gender. The age where I saw the greatest difference in items recalled was in the fourth grade males and females. I also found that females have a better overall short-term memory than males.<br><br>

"WHAT CAN YOU TELL FROM SMELL?" PHEROMONES IN HUMANS
Matthew C. Searle
Olympus Jr. High School, Holladay, UT, USA

My purpose was to determine if human pheromones can be detected by smell. My hypotheses are: Mothers will not be able to identify their children’s clothing using the sense of smell. People will not be able to identify a person’s gender by the smell of that person’s clothing.<br><br>Method <br><br> I had 12 teenagers wear t-shirts every night to bed for five nights. Mothers of the teenagers smelled the shirts and identified the gender of the person who wore the shirt. They also identified which of the shirts belonged to their child. Fifty five students smelled each shirt and identified the gender of the person who wore the each shirt.<br><br>Data<br><br>1. 3 out of 9 mothers identified their child’s t-shirt. (33%) <br><br>2. Adult women identified gender of 74 out of 108 shirts. (69%)<br><br>3. Students identified gender of 396 out of 660 shirts. (60%) <br><br>All results were statistically significant by the Chi-square test. <br><br>Conclusion<br><br>1. My hypothesis that mothers will not accurately identify their children’s clothing using the sense of smell was incorrect. Three of the mothers succeeded in choosing the correct t-shirt.<br><br>2. My hypothesis that people will not accurately identify a person’s gender by the smell of that person’s shirt was incorrect. Teenagers were able to identify 60% of all shirts correctly and adults were able to identify 69% of all shirts correctly. <br><br>3. Study participants could to some degree identify family members and gender based on the smell of their clothing.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF RELATIONAL AND OVERT AGGRESSION ON SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AND SELF-ESTEEM IN HIGH SCHOOL
Emily R. O'Neill
Poughkeepsie High School, Poughkeepsie, New York USA

A study was conducted to determine the degree to which relational and overt aggression in middle school predict students’ perception of acceptance in high school. One hundred and thirteen high school students (47% male and 53% female) responded to a 36-item questionnaire investigating their experience with aggression and perception of social and self approval. Among the major findings, 74% of non-white males, a significantly higher rate than that of their Caucasian counterparts, reported engaging in physical aggression at least once a week. The study further indicated that 91% of non-white females engaged in physical aggression at least once a week, while only 4% of the Caucasian females surveyed reported engaging in aggression on a weekly basis. In comparison to the 12.5% of non-white females who reported engaging in relational aggression, 87.5% of Caucasian females reported engaging in this type of activity on a weekly basis. Twenty-eight percent of Caucasian males reported engaging in physical aggression, while 50% of this population reported engaging in relational aggression. Eighty-eight percent of physically aggressive students were found to have high levels of social acceptance, in contrast to 17% of relationally aggressive students. Eighty percent of physically aggressive students reported high levels of self-esteem, in comparison to 29% reported by relationally aggressive respondents. Given the current trend, peer mediation appears to be an intervention schools should consider. <br><br>

NEUROLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF FIGURE-GROUND PERCEPTION
Rachel Pierson
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, United States

The Watercolor Illusion, the spreading of color from two contrasting lines onto a surface, has been shown to change the perception of the Gestalt factor of proximity, which states that closer elements tend to be grouped together. This study aims to discover why this occurs, looking most closely at the hypothesis that the color spreading is primary, the cumulative effect of the color spreading leads to association, and the heavy and light lines create border ownership. Patterns, made up of parallel lines spaced in a ratio of one to two/, were created using three shades of colors to fill in the small areas and the Watercolor Illusion to fill in the large areas. A color test gathered data on which colors most closely matched the Watercolor Illusion. A baseline pattern was established through the omission of one color. Subjects observing these patterns were more likely to group the patterns between the larger areas together as the shading in the smaller area grew closer to white. While it is possible to conclude that the impact of the Watercolor Illusion on the Gestalt factor of proximity is that the color spreading is primary, subjects did not see the expected figure-ground relationship. Thus, further testing is underway using an alternate color scheme with varying ratios of the areas.

THOUTHFUL GESTURES DO HAND MOTIONS AFFECT YOUR MEMORY?
David C. Organiscak
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett,Tx, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if memory is improved when verbal communication includes hand gestures. Memory plays a key role in today’s society. Life would be much easier if we could remember things more easily. I hypothesized that a person will recall more when hand motions are used while speaking.<br><br> The effect of hand motions on memory was tested by showing subjects two separate video segments. The first video contains words with no motions. After the video was viewed, subjects were asked to record as many words as possible. Then the second segment, which contained words with accompanying gestures, was shown. Once again, they were asked to record as many words as possible.<br><br> As a result of this project, I discovered that memory improves when a speaker uses hand gestures. Over the course of the experiment, approximately 83% of the subjects scored higher on the second segment. One thing that I noticed was that the time issue was not a problem. None of the subjects needed the full two minute time period I allotted them for memory recall.<br><br> My initial hypothesis was correct. The subjects were able to recall more information when speech and gestures are combined. Out of the thirty-six subjects tested, thirty recalled more when hand motions were added. Out of that thirty, twenty-five of them recalled at least two more words with hand motions. An extention to this study could separate subjects according to age groups and gender to see if recall differs with these variables. <br><br>

FINGERPRINTS: THE CLUE TO I.Q. (PART 3)
Christopher Paul Stanton
Grace Christian School; Tulsa, OK; USA

The purpose was to demonstrate that fingerprint patterns of individuals with autism would vary according to their cognitive abilities. The hypothesis was that individuals with high-functioning autism would have a higher number of loop pattern fingerprints than low-functioning individuals with autism.<br><br> Informed consent was obtained from the parents of thirteen children with autism. Subjects were fingerprinted using a stamp pad and fingerprint record card. Fingerprints were analyzed and identified as loops, whorls, or arches. Parents completed the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) on their child, and subjects were divided into two groups based on their CARS score. Group 1 consisted of five subjects with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome and CARS score less than 30. Group 2 consisted of eight subjects with moderate to severe autism and CARS score greater than 30. Fingerprint patterns in the two groups were compared, using fingerprints expected for the general population as a reference.<br><br> Group 1 had a 30% increase in loop fingerprints and a 29% decrease in whorl fingerprints compared to the general population. In addition, Group 1 had a 33% increase in loop fingerprints compared to the fingerprints in Group 2. Group 2 subjects had fingerprint patterns similar to the general population.<br><br> This study demonstrates that individuals with high-functioning autism have more loop pattern fingerprints than individuals with low-functioning autism. These findings suggest that predominance of loop pattern fingerprints is associated with better cognitive functioning in autism and may indicate a better prognosis.

EYEWITNESSES: CAN THEY BE TRUSTED?
Alyce Lauren Thibodeaux
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States

There is good imperial evidence to indicate that the confidence with which eyewitnesses give identification testimony is the single most important quality of testimony in terms of whether participant jurors will believe that the eyewitness correctly identified the perpetrator. The purpose of this experiment is to prove or disprove a certain hypothesis of eyewitness identification. The specific hypothesis being studied is that giving an eyewitness confirming post identification feedback will increase the eyewitness’s confidence recollection and lead them to falsely recall other qualities as well. To test this, subjects viewed a video of a man and then had to pick him out from a line up. After they had made their selection, one of three conditions was assigned to them: Disconfirming Feedback, Confirming Feedback or No feedback. They then answered a Questionnaire asking questions about their certainty levels, their view of the culprit and so on. Results from one condition were then compared the results of the other two conditions. It was proved in this experiment that Confirming Post Identification Feedback does in fact yield in the eyewitnesses recalling being overly confident. The most significant differences in answers were noticed when comparing Confirming Feedback to Disconfirming Feedback; however, significant differences were also noticed in comparing Disconfirming Feedback to No feedback and Confirming Feedback to No Feedback. In conclusion, this study accepts the experimental hypothesis: Confirming Post Identification Feedback results in witnesses recall being more confident in their identification than they actually were at the time.

ATTENTION SPAN AND ITS CORRELATION TO DRIVING IN ADOLESCENTS AND SENIOR CITIZENS (THROUGH COMPUTOR PROGRAMMING AND ANALYSIS)
Jordan Andrew Arvan
Wellington Community High School, Wellington, Florida, United States of America 

The purpose of this project was both to design an attention span test, and to use this test to see whether senior citizens or adolescents of driving age have greater attention spans and how it relates to driving. The researcher hypothesized that the seniors would have a greater attention span than that of the adolescents; however the researcher failed to consider that the reaction times of the two groups greatly differed, or that the seniors might have problems with peripheral vision. <br><br>The researcher developed a power point presentation modeled loosely off the Conner’s Continuous Performance Test. Twenty-five test subjects from both groups were exposed to two six minute displays, each of which contained the same fifty-seven letter arrangement. The latter included both audio and video clips as a means of distraction. The test data revealed little difference between the groups in the first test. However, the second test showed a great difference between the two, were as the adolescents had a degradation of 4% from the first test the senior citizens had a degradation of 16%. The test results proved the researcher’s hypothesis incorrect. One plausible cause could be that the senior citizens did not have attention span problems but had problems with their reaction times or peripheral vision.<br><br>

BRAIN VS. BRAWN: THE AFFECT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN MATURE ADULTS.
LaShanna Antoinette Young, Kyle Landon Young, Dionne LaBrada Solomon
Wildwood High School, Wildwood, FL, USA

These researchers began this project to determine the affect of physical activity on cognitive function in mature adults. From a previous year's experiment, the researchers learned that physical activity positively affects mental functioning in high school students. The researchers, however, wished to discover if exercise had the same effect on older individuals.<br><br>In order to test the original hypothesis that exercise does positively affect mental health in older individuals, the researchers tested two community softball teams and one control group. One team consisted of ten males while the other consisted of ten females, and the control group was comprised of five males and five females who did not engage in regular physical activity. The teams were given memory questionnaires at three different times during the softball season. After the testing, the results were collected and compared to be used as data in the project. This year's testing results showed a 79% average for the females, a 74.3% average for the males, and a 69.7% average for the non-athletic subjects. <br><br>The experiment proved that physical activity does yield a positive affect on psychological function in mature adults. The scores of the female athletes were higher than the male athletes, and both softball teams outscored the control group. Research on the subject matter also revealed a positive correlation between physical activity and mental functioning in older individuals. The experimentation and research conducted in this project has helped the researchers to conclude that exercise is beneficial to the brain in all aspects of life, enhancing brain function from infancy to mature adulthood.<br><br>

WHITE HOT LIES
Dani Staylor, Jacquie Gertz
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, Oregon, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if thermal imaging can be used as a means of lie detection. The hypothesis is that the amount of heat around the facial area shown on the thermal imager will increase while a person is telling a lie compared to the heat projected around the same area when a truth is told. If the difference in these two temperatures is noticeable, thermal imaging may be used to replace the modern polygraph as a means of lie detection. <br><br> Procedures used to test the hypothesis are as follows: there were ten randomly selected human test subjects. Each subject was asked to truthfully answer all 10 of the control questions in front of the thermal imager then draw a “Truth” or “Lie” card. The subject was then asked to answer 10 experimental questions according to instructions on the card in front of the thermal imager. Photographs were taken with a Flir PS600 thermal-imaging camera, which measures temperature in degrees Celsius. <br><br> The results of the test were not as hypothesized. Instead of facial temperature increasing with the telling of a lie, most subjects’ facial temperature dramatically decreased. The temperature of subjects holding truth cards stayed relatively constant.<br><br>In conclusion, thermal imaging may be used as a means of lie detection, though, not yet as accurately as modern polygraphs. There are far too many variables to skew thermal imaging results: air conditioning, fever, and other temperature changing factors may mask a lie or create false results. <br><br>

We investigated problem solving strategies and differences in completion time in subjects of both genders ranging from 5 to 75 years of age. Each subject was asked to assemble a simple (24 piece) jigsaw puzzle. We recorded the strategies they used, completion time, gender and age. Strategies were identified as follows:<br><br>starting with the picture<br><br>starting with the border<br><br>no apparent pattern (random)<br><br>Completion time was taken from the time the puzzle box was opened until the last piece was placed into the puzzle. <br><br>We have found a statistically significant difference in completion times between genders and are continuing to research this question. Other data are thus far inconclusive, but we hope that information from additional subjects will give us better results.<br><br>

RELIABILITY OF CRIMINAL EVIDENCE: A COMPARISON OF VALIDITY RANKINGS IN FORENSIC OBSERVATIONS
Rachel Cherie Palmer, Samantha Granberg
Lakeview High School, Lakeview, Oregon, USA

In today's society, the public is influenced by forensic television shows such as Law and Order, CSI, CSI: Miami, Cold Case, and Without a Trace. This leads us to believe that one type of evidence is enough to convict, while another can be thrown out the window. However, does the public have the right idea as to what evidence is even considered valid? This study compares the opinion of our peers and factual statistics along with an experiment that has been engineered to test how they would fare as an eye witness. To do this we used a video, a survey pertaining to that video, and a survey testing their view on valid evidence.

URBAN-RURAL COMPOST PREPARATION ACCEPTANCE DESCRIPTIVE COMPARASION
Ishwara Margarita Ayala, Frances Saez Diaz
S.U. Maria C. Santiago, Comerio, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptance that the residents of the urban and rural zone of the Municipality of Comerío have to produce compost. This arises as a result of the lack of efficient mechanisms that the recycling program of Comerío has for the recycling of organic materials. To gather information an 11 questions questionnaire was developed. The questions were divided into four categories (general information of the interviewed person, types of wastes in the home, participation in recycling campaigns and knowledge about the composting). This questionnaire was administered to 20% of the residents of Sabana del Palmar Urbanization (urban) and to the residents of Parcels of Palomas (rural). In order to select the houses where interviews were going to be held, a systematic sampling was made. The starting point was selected at random and from there the interviews were made at each fifth house until completing the sample. The results demonstrated that the urban zone produced more solid wastes than the rural zone. It was found that the residents of the rural zone had greater knowledge of the term composting. Both sectors considered that the composting is a natural mechanism of recycling. 50% of the persons surveyed in the rural zone were very interested in producing compost in their homes and 41.75% from the urban zone were very interested. With the data collected in this investigation the Recycling Project of Comerío is due to establish a pilot plan to produce compost in this Municipality.<br><br>

Elko High School, Elko, Nevada, USA

Understanding formation processes associated with fire-cracked rock (FCR) is important in determining prehistoric resource exploitation strategies. Experimentation by archaeologists is needed to determine what kinds of cooking activities (pit-roasting or boiling foods) and how much activity it took to form the piles of FCR debris common on prehistoric sites.<br><br> Basalt rocks were sorted into two size and texture matched piles. Rocks weighed between 0.5 and 2 kilograms. Fires were started in each of two pits, 60-65 cm in diamter and 20-25 cm deep. Rocks were heated in each fire for at least an hour. After the hour, the roasting rocks and a food package insulated with juniper foliage were buried in the roasting pit. The boiling rocks were taken from the other fire, one by one, and placed into a pot of 2 gallons of cold water until the water boiled. The "used" rocks were removed and a hot rock or two (from the fire) was added to maintain a boil until all the rocks had been used. One to three hours later the buried rocks and food were dug out.<br><br> Rocks and broken pieces were examined for cracks, breakage, and color changes. The boiling rocks broke more than the roasting, but overall there was not enough breakage to compare shapes. Color change was minimal, but the rocks were black-gray from the beginning.<br><br>

Andrews High School, Andrews, TX USA

Our project was based on effects of multitasking while driving versus non-driving on blood pressure and reaction times and if using a tester of opposite gender affects this. We gathered 200 licensed high school students (100 males/100 females). For reaction time we constructed a box placed on dashboard. All tests involved both driving and non-driving. For Control, drivers had no music, food etc. Next they listened to music (R&B, Country, Tejano) again driving and non-driving. Test three involved girls applying makeup and boys eating burritos. Another task involved reaching for a CD. Retesting occurred with gender tester changes. Blood pressures were taken before/after each test along with reaction times. The overall average results of Boy Reaction Time/Blood Pressure Driving results were: Control 1.43 seconds, 130/49; Combined Music Results 1.99 seconds, 135/45; Combined Tasks 2.75 seconds, 143/54. Boys Non-driving: Control 3.96 seconds, 135/43; Music 3.30 seconds, 137/53; Tasks 3.25 seconds, 151/63. Girls Driving Results were: Control 1.83 seconds, 124/50; Music 2.07 seconds, 137/45; Tasks 1.81 seconds, 141/46. Girls Non-driving were: Control 1.23 seconds, 131/50; Music 1.49 seconds, 134/42; Tasks 1.68 seconds, 136/55. Gender results of boys testing girls were: Control 1.57 seconds, 138/60; Music 1.45 seconds, 140/51; Tasks 2.12 seconds, 145/53. Results show that boys are faster on reaction times when driving and slower during driving with distractions occurring; however girls are faster while driving and slower only when non-driving and with music while driving. More distractions do not bother as much except when a male is the test administrator.

THE EFFECT OF TEACHER AND STUDENT LEARNING STYLES ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
Brooke Ashley Forbes, Nick Stewart
Delavan Comm. High School Delavan, Illinois US

There are three main learning styles. A learning style is the method by which a person learns and comprehends new ideas or theories. Visual learning is learning through the sense of sight. Visual learners learn best by listening to lectures and rewriting words. Auditory learning is accomplished best through the use of hearing and sound. Auditory learners learn best by listening to lectures and verbal expressions. The third learning style is kinesthetic/tactile, which is accomplished through the use of larger muscles and the sense of touch. These learners learn best by walking around while studying, or drawing graphs.<br><br> By surveying the students and teachers in their high school, the researchers attempted to determine whether there was a correlation between student and teacher learning styles, and students' grades in three randomly selected classes. Before conducting the study, researchers selected 3 out of 56 classes taught in the high school. Then, 150 copies of a non-copyright protected learning style survey were made and numbered. The surveys were distributed to all the teachers and students. An announcement was made that all were invited to take the survey and become part of the study. It was made clear that the survey was not mandatory and names would not be used or known by researchers. Once the surveys were completed, the Counselor then collected them and placed the grades on the appropriate surveys and removed any names. Surveys were then returned to the researchers, who tallied and analyzed the results of the surveys, and drew conclusions.<br><br> Fifty five percent of the teachers were visual learners, 39% were kinesthetic, and 6% were auditory, while 16% of the students were visual, 78% were kinesthetic, and 6% were auditory. This was very different than the national norm. When class grade, teacher and student learning style was compared, no relationship was found.

PROVING PIAGET'S PRINCIPLE
Asha Jaya Hosangadi, Pranali Koradia
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills Michigan, USA

The field of developmental psychology seeks to understand human development from the womb to the tomb. One of the most important contributions to the field came from Jean Piaget’s studies of how human cognitive abilities unfold. Based on his work with children and young adults, Piaget identified four stages of human cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational and formal operations. Piaget viewed each stage as distinct and progressive. That is, a child must acquire the abilities of one stage in order to progress to a subsequent one. Piaget defined each stage by two characteristics age and cognitive ability. In order to determine if children progress through the four stages of cognitive development as identified and defined by Piaget, we conducted four experiments on 100 children from ages 3-14 over a four-month period of time. Contrary to Piaget’s conclusions, our data revealed the following: (1) there is no specific age at which a child progresses from one cognitive stage to another; and (2) a child can exhibit characteristics of more than one stage at one time.

GENDER ROLES IN NORTHERN PAIUTE SHAMANISM: AN ANAYSIS THROUGH THE ROCK ART RECORD
Stefanie Gayle Price, William Hallett, Marie Sakai
West Salem High School, Salem, OR, United States

Our intention in this research project was to explore the relationships between Northern Paiute men and women through an examination of the rock art record in Eastern Oregon. We examined the role and place of shaminism in this record and how the rock art reflected the mythopoetic narratives and symbolic world of the Northern Paiute. Futher, we looked at the role of ritualistic plants in the creation of this art by examining the relationships of phosphene patterns to rock art motifs found at the survey sites. The rock art record reflected the value systems of a culture different than our own, creating a moral encoding system that gave direction to people's lives and their artwork. By exploring the ideas of gender and art we hope to generate greater understandings that cross cultural boundaries.

THE EFFECTS OF CLASS STRUCTURE ON LEARNING ABILITIES
Lela Louise Rundle, Branndie Sievertsen, Kia Orr
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, Colorado, United States of America

The Japanese language has three types of alphabets. The three are Katakana, Hiragana, and Kanji. The one that most closely resembles American drawings is that of Kanji. It is an older form of writing and is rarely used by the Japanese people. They use Chinese characters to influence their language, and it is a very complex form of writing. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to see if the class structure had any effect on the learning abilities on the students present. The researchers chose to use the classes of art and biology because the art students were more affiliated with drawings as opposed to the biology students who were more apt to memorize from books rather than draw anything. The two classes were taught and tested for one week and then their scores were compared. <br><br>The researchers concluded that the art students learned the language faster as opposed to the biology students who learned it more accurately. The reasons for this were that the art students compared the characters of Kanji to what they had been drawing in class. Moreover, the biology students were more detail orientated and simply memorized the characters. <br><br>Students abroad learning different languages could use this information in helping them learn which type of classes to take to help them in learning their languages faster and more efficiently.

PATTERN RECOGNITION USING ELECTRICAL STIMULATION
Amy Maria Mauseth, Andrea Marie Brown
Deubrook Area High School, White, SD, United States

The brain, in combination with all of its sensory nerves, forms a complex system that can recognize various senses, and produce a learned response when stimulated. This experiment was designed to test the perception of the skin, and the accuracy of the brain's ability to interpret information being received from an electrical stimulus. Our hypothesis states that subjects will be able to successfully identify electrically stimulated patterns on the skin with a greater than 50% accuracy. The goal of this experiment was to submit a series of tests to human subjects, to determine if each subject could successfully identify the pattern of an applied electrical stimulus. To provide a controlled pattern of electrical stimulation to the skin, a commercial nerve stimulator was used to provide the electrical stimulus, a custom switch box to distribute the stimulus signal to output cables, and stick-on medical electrodes were placed on the skin. We tested twelve subjects, each with the same forty patterns, randomly administered, and recorded the patterns they answered correctly and incorrectly. The correct pattern recognition varied from 65.8% to 99.2% for four different electrode patterns. The twelve subjects had an overall correct recognition of 398 out of 400 patterns (82.9% accurate). Our hypothesis was proven true: subjects can successfully identify electrically stimulated patterns on the skin with a greater than 50% accuracy. Additional experimental work should be completed to find out how to improve the pattern recognition accuracy, and how to use this approach to replace or assist a subject's impaired sense.

IS PESTLE-SHAPED THUMB GENETICALLY CONTROLLED?
Songyue Zheng, Jie Geng , Ping Yang
Zhengzhou Normal School ,Zhengzhou,Henan Province,China

Pestle-shaped thumb, which is characterized by a high ratio (about two) of the width to the length of thumbnail, is frequently observed in Chinese population. However, it is still unknown whether this phenomenon is genetically controlled. The objective of the present study was to investigate the genetics of pestle-shaped thumb. The physical survey was performed on 12180 students in 15 elementary and middle schools around Zhengzhou area, Henan province, China. Data analysis demonstrated that pestle-shaped thumb is genetically controlled with a relatively constant occurrence at approximately 2% in the population studied. The results also indicated that pestle-shaped thumb is not sex-linked. Furthermore, some families have a high occurrence frequency of pestle-shaped thumb. Forty pedigree families with high occurrence of pestle-shaped thumb were further analyzed. Pedigree analysis also suggested that pestle-shaped thumb is unlikely controlled by one pair of allele genes. Instead, multiple genes may be involved in the genetic control of this inherited phenomenon. In conclusion, pestle-shaped thumb is an inherited character, which is controlled by multiple genes.The further genetic analysis about pestle-shaped thumb, its distribution,the ratio among different nationalities and possible linked markers will be carried out and characterized in the near future.

COLOR THEORY
Athina LaVonne Schmidt, Lyndsay Yarrison
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head Island SC, USA

For the project, Color Theory, our purpose was to test the theories of design through the medium of color. Our hypothesis was that a design comprised of a linear pattern would be most pleasing to the human’s subconscious search for balance and symmetry. To complete this project and test the hypothesis we surveyed 50 students between the ages of 12 and 17 (an equal number of males and females). We showed them three designs classified by the lines they were comprised of: straight/horizontal, curved, and zig-zag. We showed these three designs in seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and white. The colors were used to make sure that the individual subjects had an opportunity to see the design in every color therefore eliminating any color bias. We had the subjects chose their “favorite” in each color set (each color set had design #’s 1, 2, and 3 in one color). We recorded the results in each. When faced with analyzing the data we discovered the overall differences between the zig-zag and curved design had almost the same rate of selection, but design three had a very low rate of design. In conclusion we grouped the zig-zag and curved patterns because their rate of selection only differed by 4 votes versus the straight design which had very menial selection rates; therefore our hypothesis was proven incorrect.

STOPPED BY THE LIGHT
Tyler Reynolds Belcher, Tyler Johnston
South Oldham High School, Crestwood Kentucky, United States

The purpose or problem of this experiment is to find out if making stop signs more visible will affect the percentage of people that stop at the stop sign (hopefully increase the percentage). The way in which we (my associate and I) conducted this experiment is by placing a regular flashing light on the stop sign. Our hypothesis is that when a flashing light is placed on the stop sign, making it more visible, more people will stop at the stop sign. <br><br> First my associate and I collected data by recording how many vehicles stop at a specific stop sign when there is no enhanced visibility. This took several trials to get sufficient data (200 cars). Once we completed this portion of our experiment, we placed a flashing light on the stop sign and then recorded how many vehicles stopped at the stop sign. After this portion of the experiment was completed, all necessary data had been collected and we compared the two sets of data.<br><br> Our results show that the flashing light had a large effect on how many drivers stopped at the stop sign. The effect was that more people stopped when the flashing light was on the stop sign. Although, we cannot conclude if the light caused the people to stop because they could see the stop sign better and actually care about the law, or if they where just wondering why it was there in the first place. <br><br>

A NOVEL USE OF THE GSR2 BIOFEEDBACK METER TO MEASURE HUMAN RESPONSE TO AURAL AND VISUAL STIMULI ABSTRACT
Charvi Ganatra, Irene Lee, Jessica Sun
The Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, DE, USA

The experiment conducted represents a first-time study of aural and visual shock reactions in human subjects using the Galvanic Skin Response 2 (GSR2) biofeedback meter and the corresponding Calmlink software. The study exposed each of the sixty-three participating individuals to three separate shocking stimuli: an audio stimulus, a video stimulus, and a combination of the two. The GSR2 measured the body’s electrical conductance with two electrodes, i.e. two fingers which were placed on the meter’s metal plates. By way of the microphone jack, the GSR2 transmitted these readings in sound frequency, and the Calmlink software converted this into graphical form. The data thus collected was a graph of relative conductance (RC) versus time (in seconds); the higher the RC, the stronger the subject’s reaction to the stimulus. From the Calmlink software, the data was transposed into a Microsoft EXCEL table, where it was subjected to rigorous statistical validation tests. The statistical analysis revealed that on average, an individual’s change in RC was larger for audio stimuli than for video stimuli. <br><br>

ISOLATION AND EVALUATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA
Sameer Gorav Gupta, Brice Alfred Bongiovanni
Central High School, Macon, Ga, USA

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) traces maternal heritage, placing an individual in a lineage group, called a haplogroup. Four halpogroups were known in the Americas, but a fifth, previously found only in Europe, was discovered in pre-Columbian remains in Illinois (1200 AD). The Libben site (800 AD) in Ohio is one of the largest burials found in North America. No genetic typing had been done on American remains prior to 1200 AD.<br><br> The purpose of the experiment was to isolate and haplogroup-type mtDNA from the Libben remains. The hypothesis was mtDNA could be isolated from Libben site teeth samples and that Native American haplogruops could be demonstrated with molecular techniques. <br><br> Teeth from five individuals were obtained from the owner of the remains. The root of each tooth was separated from the enamel and ground into a powder. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment analysis were used to amplify DNA in specific regions of the mitochondria to detect haplogroups A, B, C, and D.<br><br> Results showed mitochondrial DNA was isolated from all individuals and Native American DNA was demonstrated in one individual. Degradation and lack of sufficient DNAs prevented determination of haplogroups in the remaining individuals. This project extends the current finding of Native American haplogroups approximately 300 years prior to the previous oldest report in the literature.<br><br>

CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT, CLASSES, AND STRESS AND THE EFFECT IT HAS ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Nava E. Cohen
F.W. Springstead High, Spring Hill, Florida, United States of America

This project deals with trying to understand the correlation between student's social environment, rigor of classes, and student's stress level so that students can be more successful in their academic and social environments.<br><br> There will be a correlation between the social environment of a student, the rigor of classes, and the student's stress, that affects the student's stress level.<br><br> A survey will be given to local high school students. Consent Form 4 will be used for the students taking the survey, so that their parents are aware of the survey. Survey areas include: parents' and grandparents' marital status, student GPA, student age and sex, question of student's classes, social environment, emotions/attitude/behavior in school.<br><br> To form this self-report survey, information was researched through literature and formal consultation with a school psychologist. Questions were written by the chai square method to obtain maximum information about the student. After the survey was formed, a professional psychologist thoroughly reviewed and revised the survey to ease any problems that could have arisen from the questions. Possible risks that already exist from stressful situations can be agitated by this survey, this is why there is parents' consent for the teenager to fill out the survey.<br><br> The hypothesis of this project was proven correct. There is a correlation among social environment, class rigor, and student's stress that can and will affect the student's stress level. This was proven by seeing the class rigor and how many classes they took, as well as adding in the contributing factor of whether the teenager has a job, and then adding in the final factor of home-life situations that definitely affected the teenager's choices in life. A little over 50% of the participants surveyed were females resulting in an unequal balance of sex as well as of age.

MUSIC & STUDYING: IS THERE A LINK? A 3-YR. STUDY: A COMPARISON OF SPECIAL EDICATION & GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS
Stephanie Nicole Sickels
Okeechobee High School, Okeechobee, FL USA

This project continued to research learning and studying while listening to music to determine whether there is a difference in test performance of Special Education (SE) students versus General Education (GE) students. Previous experiments proved that music did enhance student performance and that classical generated the greatest increases in scores.<br><br> Two GE classes were given history passages, study guides and tests to study in silence and then again the following day with classical music playing softly. The experiment was repeated utilizing SE students under the same conditions.<br><br> The experiment produced a GE test score, without music of 54% vs. 76% with music. SE students averaged 55% without music and 74% with music. 80% of GE students passed, as did 68% of SE. A difference of 12% between the groups while listening to classical music is significant.<br><br> T-Test calculations produced a p-value of .295 for tests administered while listening to music. Therefore, if the experiment is reproduced, the GE students would score 70.5% higher if listening to classical music. A T-Test on the second test produced a p-value of .386, therefore, the GE students would score 61.4% better than the SE students studying without music.<br><br> The conclusion drawn by the experiment substantiates previous assumptions of the data collected that we can expect score improvement while listening to classical music. This experiment could be repeated in other situations and produce similar results of improved scores. Applications to society promise that this type of studying could be applied on a wide scale in educational settings.<br><br>

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE MEDIA ON BODY IMAGE AND SELF ESTEEM
Jillian Meredith Phipps
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs FL, 32714, USA

The media is found to be a selective and often negative catalyst. It plays a very influential role in the lives of the teenage generation. The focus has always been placed on them, but what happens when one outgrows that age bracket? Do the negative influences just disappear? To research the validity of this question posed, a study was done with 200 subjects divided into two age brackets. One bracket consisting of 100 subjects represented the teenage population, ranging from 16-18 years of age. And the other bracket of 100 subjects, represented the adult population, ranging anywhere from 30-50 years of age. Within these age brackets 50 individuals were male and 50 were female. These subjects were selected at random and surveyed. After evaluating the surveys, each individual's media exposure, body image, and self-esteem was rated. A significance test was then performed to support or reject the hypotheses that there is a relationship between media exposure and body image and self-esteem and also that the teenage population is more negatively impacted by the media than the adult population. Unexpectedly, there was only one “significant “ relationship found, and that was between the media exposure and body satisfaction of adult females. Aside from the significance test however, adults and teenagers have equal media ratings and yet have slightly higher self esteem levels but lower body image levels. Overall the age of the population responds differently to the media but not at significant levels.

CAN SIMULATED ROBOTIC BEHAVIORS ELICIT RESPONSES FROM ANOLIS SAGREI?
Thomas Kemerer Bunbury
Center for Advanced Technology, Saint Petersburg, Florida, United States

Over the last few years the use of robotics to study animal behaviors has become more popular. Behavioral researchers have realized robotics as a way to increase their knowledge about animal behavior. The Brown Anole, Anolis Sagrei, a common lizard in the southeastern United States, is known for its unique head bobbing as a form of communication. Researchers have tried to interpret these bobs to better understand the lizard and its reaction to the environment around it. To determine if the number of head bobs that a lizard displays elicited a specific type of response from other lizards a robotic lizard was created. This robotic lizard was constructed out of Lexan and constructed to mimic the Anolis Sagrei. This lizard was driven by a servo motor and bobbed its head in 2, 3 and 4 bob cycles. Another still cycle was included with zero head bobs. The real lizard’s reaction was then assigned a number between zero and seven, zero being no reaction, and seven being an extreme reaction. Statistical analysis of the response data showed that the lizards responded significantly less to the four head bob cycle. This significance is based on a 99% confidence level between four bobs and no movement, a 98% confidence level between 4 bobs and 2 bobs, and a 98% confidence level between 3 bobs and four bobs. There was no significant difference between 2 and 3 bobs, 2 and no movement, or 3 and no movement. It was hypothesized that a larger number of head bobs would elicit a greater response because the head bob is a sign of aggression. However the data shows that more head bobs elicits less of a response then the fewer bobs. This lack of reaction could mean that a small number of head bobs are a sign of aggression, or a large number of head bobs mean nothing.

MEMORIZATION, DURATION, AND MOTIVATION
Cristina Maria Canfield
A. Crawford Mosley High School, Lynn Haven, FL, United States

The researcher tested ninth-grade advanced students to determine if length of time without rehearsal of information and a student’s motivation to learn the material affected his/her ability to recall it. Concerning duration, the researcher hypothesized if the initial presentation of a concept were only stored in the short-term memory of the student, testing occurring closer to the time of presentation would result in higher scores. This was proven incorrect. Eight series, each consisting of a scientific fact and quiz was presented to each of the seventy student subjects. The students recorded the fact three times and after a specific amount of time a quiz was given. The “notes and quizzes” were then analyzed to determine if there was, in fact, a correlation between test scores and length of time between memorizing a fact and recalling it. There was little correlation. Also, the scores did not seem to increase or decrease with the passing of each series of facts and quizzes, proving hypothesis three wrong. <br><br> Next the researcher gave a surprise formative test with all eight scientists. The students did poorly on this test. They were then given a sheet with all the correct answers to study for a summative test on which the students did very well. Concerning the students’ motivation, the researcher hypothesized that since the students were in an Honors Science class, they would care about their grades (summative grades). Therefore, the tests that counted more of his/her grade would have better scores. This hypothesis was proven correct. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF SEXUALLY APPEALING IMAGES ON COGNITIVE PROCESSING SPEED
Devin Michael Elting
James Bicknell Castle High School, Kaneohe, Hawaii, United States of America

The effect of sexually provocative images on automatic cognitive processing in 20 male and 20 female subjects was examined using a modified Stroop task. As was predicted, no main effect for gender was found (F=1.87, p=.179). Likewise the main effect for visual stimuli (neutral vs. sexually provocative images) was strong (F=8.72, p=.00039), again as was predicted. However, the hypothesis that a gender by stimuli interaction would be found was not supported (F=1.09, p=.34). It was hypothesized that male response times would be slower when presented with sexually provocative images of females while female response times would be slower when presented with sexually provocative images of males. Visual inspection of graphed data suggests that female subjects showed the predicted response pattern but male subjects had slowed reaction times in response to both male and female images judged to be sexually provocative. Possible theoretical explanations for these findings included homophobic socialization of males and biologically based reactions to dominance hierarchies. Additional study is called for to explore these hypotheses. (Note: Based on feedback provided by judges in earlier rounds the study sample size will be increased. Consequently, findings presented at the International Science Fair may be different than those reported here.)

PSEUDOMEMORIES: CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT WE REMEMBER?
Paige Nicole Paxton
The Villages High School, the Villages, FL, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if our memories are really believable, or if they're false based upon things we are exposed to. A pseudomemory is the idea that our memories are false based upon something we might've seen or heard. In my experiment, I hoped to prove the theory of pseudomemories to be true.<br><br> For my experiment, I tested my patients by giving them a ten question survey. Then, I had them read a short story about a boy who had fallen out of a tree. Two weeks after the first session, I had to patients re-take the same survey to observe if anyone's answers had changed based upon the story. After all the surveys had been completed , I examined the first survey, then compared it with the second one. Along with testing my first set of patients, I also tested a control group to prove that if any patients changed their answers it would've been in result of the story they had read. For my control group, I tested them with the same survey as the others, both sessions, except they didn't read the story in between.<br><br> In conclusion, my hypothesis was proved to be incorrect. Unfortunately, most of the surveys remained the same. In the future, if I chose to re-test my experiment I would probably improve my test by adding more detail to the survey and story. I would increase the amount of questions in the survey as well as the difficulty, and I would lengthen the story, also by adding more detail. Although my experiment didn't prove my hypothesis to be correct, with my research supporting me, I still feel that pseudomemories do indeed occur. I am still debating whether to always truly believe what I remember. <br><br>

REACTIONS

Does the way customers dress affect the way store and restaurant personnel act towards them? There are many ways to dress. A person who likes a certain image tends to dress similar to that image. Different reactions to different types of people are almost always expected, and some people dress differently just to get reactions from people. If dressed like a punk, a "valley" person, a poor person, a pregnant teenager, and a regular person, then the responses to each subject will vary.<br><br>Five outfits were worn by the researcher while visiting four different types of stores and one fast food restaurant. The amount of time it took for the clerks to assist and the attitudes of the clerks to the subject were recotded after each visit. Z scores were calculated to compare the proportion of rude clerks to each personality, while t-tests compared the times.<br><br>The significant results showed that the clerks were ruder to the pregnant teenager and the punk than to the poor person, "valley" person, and the normal person. It also took the clerks significantly longer to assist the pregnant teenager and the punk than to the poor person, "valley" person, and the normal person. A possible correction for future projects on this topic would be dressing more like the personality to get more responses.

DOES VIUAL, AUDITORY, OR GUSTORY PRECEPTION HAVE THE GREATEST AFFECT ON A SUPERTASTER, MEDIUMTASTER, OR A NONTASTER: A FIFTH YEAR STUDY
Jessica Caroline Stanton
Columbia High School, Lake City FL, United States

Does visual and auditory perception have an affect on the gustory complex? Does it have the greatest affect on a supertaster, mediumtaster, or a nontaster? I believe that out of 540 trials 70% of supertasters, 60% of mediumtasters, and 50% of nontasters will be affected. Wearing gloves I put tasteless blue dye on my subject’s tongue. I held a piece of paper with three holes in it, counting the taste papillae. After my subject took a sip of water he or she tasted a pudding, which was colored red or blue, and tell me what flavor he or she believes it is. I then blindfolded my subject and repeated the test. After the blindfold was removed I gave my subject a spoon with cherry flavored, red pudding. I said the word “blue.” He or she told me the flavor that they believe the pudding to be. I repeated with a berry-flavored pudding. 57% of supertasters, 51% of mediumtasters, and 41% of nontasters were affected by the perception of color. My project could make a great impact on advertising companies around the world. I have found that the auditory suggestion of a color is more influential than a visual suggestion. According to my study, the cafeteria food would be much of appetizing with the use of an “auditory color.” An auditory color could be used for bland and tasteless foods. For instance, the military, NASA, or any other industry that advertises or supplies food could use it. <br><br>

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS PHASE II: TREATMENT IMPACT AND MANAGEMENT ISSUES
Antonio Javier Pietrantoni
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA

The purpose of this investigation is to contribute knowledge to the scientific community and to provide a new angle to dealing with Breast and Prostate cancer patients and survivors and their Quality of Life. <br><br> Among Breast and Prostate cancer patients and survivors there is a limited amount of knowledge regarding their HRQOL. We hypothesized that QOL was affected by the educational level, civil status and treatment of a patient and that survivors would have a better QOL than patients. The FACT-B and FACT-P, HRQOL questionnaires for Breast and Prostate cancer, were administered to participants in a span of two years, the first year to those with Breast cancer and the second to those with Prostate cancer. The variables were then scored/analyzed using scales provided by FACIT. Overall, Breast cancer survivors scored the highest QOL score than Breast cancer patients and Prostate cancer patients and survivors. Hispanic women have a High Social Scale HRQOL possibly because women are affected in Emotional terms by their disease and look for support in contacts or groups while Hispanic men with Prostate cancer have a lower social scale score mainly because they tend to be more personal about their condition. The Physical and Functional Scales had no significant difference in score, except with Prostate cancer patients. <br><br> With Hispanic Breast and Prostate cancer patients and survivors, the HRQOL does not solely depend on the effects of treatments, civil status and education, but, on the perception and coping capabilities experience has given them.

QUANTITATIVE EEG AS AN IDENTIFIER OF LEARNING MODALITY
Ilang Mae Guiroy
York School, Monterey, CA, U.S.A.

In the current educational system, students who are highly modal learners miss out on a portion of their education. One feasible solution offered to this dilemma is for the educational system to adapt to the learning modality of the student with the use of a quantitative measure of her learning modality.<br><br> This study offers a new method that uses the measure of mental focus while a person is being taught in different learning modalities in order to create a numerical measure using brain waves. Twenty students with a mean age of sixteen were included in the study. Each subject was given an assessment, which stimulated learning in three modalities: auditory, tactile/kinesthetic and visual. While learning, the subject’s frontal lobe brain activity was monitored using electroencephalograph (EEG) sensors. Brainwave data were processed in real time by a computer software program using a ratio derived from theta and alpha brainwaves as a measure of mental focus (Quantitative EEG (QEEG)). In this study, QEEG identified a preferred learning modality 86% of the time indicating that the learning modality of a student can be identified from brainwave activity.<br><br> This quantitative EEG identifier of learning modality will offer educators a new set of tools to adapt their teaching to match the needs of the students.<br><br>

VIDEO GAMES: FRIEND OR FOE?
Peter David Allen
York Catholic High School, York, Pennsylvania, United States of America

The American public has been exposed to the “dark side” of video games: the graphic violence, the brutal subject matter, and its addictive qualities. Recently, the redeeming qualities of video games are coming to light. Soldiers in all branches of the military play video games to train, video game playing surgeons are making fewer errors when operating, and stroke victims are being rehabilitated faster by the use of video games. Experimentation was performed to determine if teenagers who play video games regularly have better hand-eye coordination and visual attention skills than those who don’t play. During video game play, the neurotransmitter dopamine is released. Dopamine increases a person’s ability to learn; therefore, increasing their hand-eye coordination and visual attention skills.<br><br> The subjects were teenagers who were divided into two categories, gamers (3+ hours/week) and non-gamers (less than 3 hours/week), based on the amount of video games they typically played per week. The experiment tested hand-eye coordination by using a ruler drop test and a cup stacking test. Subjects were tested in visual attention using an object find test and a multi-object slideshow flash test.<br><br> In respect to eye-hand coordination, non-gamers scored 41% lower than gamers in the ruler drop test and 10.4% lower in the cup stacking test. With respect to visual attention, non-gamers scored 31.2% lower on the object find test and 16.3% lower in the multi-object slideshow flash test. Gamers proved to have superior hand-eye coordination and visual attention over non-gamers.<br><br>

THE PEER PRESSURE EFFECT A SEARCH FOR GREATER UNDERSTANDING
Cristina Maria Costantini
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee WI, USA

The purpose of my experiment is to find a practical and reliable method of measuring the degree of susceptibility to peer pressure in individuals, and to find a scientific method to study and gain a greater understanding of the cause and effect of peer pressure.<br><br> Forty freshman boys were first instructed to complete five different paper-and-pencil tests, four of which are commonly used by social psychologists to measure various personality traits including self-monitoring, self-consciousness and self-esteem. I designed the fifth test myself to measure self-confidence, leadership, and friendship skills.<br><br> Each test subject was then seated in a room with three other students and instructed to answer 25 verbal math problems. The test subject was not aware that the other three students in the room were “plants” who had been instructed to give the wrong answers to some of the problems. The ten questions which the test subject was asked to answer first were used to measure his math ability. The ten questions which he was asked to answer last were used to measure peer pressure susceptibility. When the test subject answered last, he was forced to make a decision whether to go along with the wrong answer which he had just heard from the three “plants”, or give his own answer.<br><br> My experiment was able to measure the degree of conformity in each test subject and to identify statistically significant correlations between specific personality traits and conformity. This experimental method may be used to gain a greater understanding of the cause and effect of peer pressure.<br><br>

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Peter Michael Bishara
Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School, Jersey City, NJ, USA

This project began with a series of forwarded e-mails sent to me. I was intrigued how the tests knew all the answers I would say before I even said them. The underlying principle of this project was to comprehend how my mind, and all minds, are affected by the repetition of items. This repetition is also known as the priming effect. The priming effect shows a manipulation over certain parts of the brain; the Frontal Cortex (thinking process) and the Parietal Lobe (Association Area). Forty test subjects were given three different examinations all using the priming effect. All tests proved to show 62% of the subjects to have the correct, or primed, answer. A Chi-square analysis of the data confirmed that the expected answers were given and that the priming effect was statistically significant. Each test also showed varying levels of the priming effect suggesting that the amount of priming does not have a significant increase on the accuracy of an answer.

THE GERMAN DIALECT IN THE FORMER COLONY OF BAUMSCHNEIS
Bruno Gasparotto Ponne
Fundação Liberato Salzano da Cunha - Novo Hamburgo - RS - Brasil

In the beginning of the XIX century, Europe was going through terrible wars that left its people extremely impoverished. The Germanic peoples lived in wretched conditions in this context. Hence, as of 1824, immigration to Brazil turned out to be an opportunity for a better life. The idea of bringing these people to Brazil came from Empress Maria Leopoldina, wife of the Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro I. She was of German descent and wanted to help people undergoing difficulties in her homeland.<br><br> Germans started to arrive in Brazil in 1824 bringing with them an enormous cultural background. So, even after 180 years, some habits and traditions which they brought from Germany still remain very strong. This project investigates one of these traditions: the speaking of the German dialect even until today in the city of Dois Irmãos, the late German colony of Baumschneis.<br><br> This theme was idealized taking into account that there are very many German descendants living in Southern Brazil who are interested in fostering the culture of their forefathers, and this includes their language. <br><br> That is why this investigation sought to answer the question of why some German descendants preserve this dialect and others not. This was achieved through interviews and theoretical references. All this was released to the community so that there would be a revival and a reflection of their history, and, in this way, maintaining the traditions of their ancestors and preserving the cultural plurality which exists in Brazil. <br><br>

DJUHA'S SLEEVE: A STUDY ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE ORAL TRADITION
Katie Lynn Thompson
St. Clair High School, St. Clair, Minnesota, United States

Djuha's Sleeve was a study of the reliability of the oral tradition. My experiment was designed to imitate the game Telephone. I chose a Syrian folk tale called "Djuha's Sleeve" and told it to one person. I then recorded that person telling the story to someone else. The second person told it to a third person while I recorded it, and so on, until the story had been passed through six people. I used the recordings to track the number of changes that occurred in the story from one version to the next. As it turned out, none of the final versions of the story were anywhere near the original version. Based on the results, I can conclude that no one ever listens to or interprets data exactly the same way, so no story ever has been or ever will be told the same way twice.

THE EFFECTS OF CHRONOLOGICAL AGE ON TEENAGE DECISION MAKING
Ashley Sandra Kroubetz
Lake Crystal Wellcome Memorial Secondary School, Lake Crystal, MN, United States

This project was chosen because there is information that needs to be shared regarding issues that teenagers are facing today. The purpose of this project was to determine how chronological age affects teenagers in the areas of study habits, sexual activity, alcohol use, and drug use. It was hypothesized that chronological age would have a negative effect on teenagers as they got older in the areas of sexual activity, alcohol use, and drug use, but chronological age would have a positive effect in the areas of drinking and driving. A confidential survey of students in grades 7-12 was done to test the hypothesis. The hypothesis that chronological aging did have a negative effect in the areas of sexual activity, alcohol use, and drug use was supported. However, it was not supported in that chronological aging did not have a positive effect on drinking and driving. The largest turning point in the decision making of teenagers apprears to occur between 8th and 9th grade. This is when sexual activity, alcohol use, and drug use increased dramatically. These findings show that even more needs to be done to educate and help young people with their choices.

LIAR, LIAR, YOUR STOMACH'S ON FIRE
Trisha Satya Pasricha
Clear Lake High School; Houston, TX; USA

The aim of this study was to test the effects of lying on the electrical rhythm of the stomach. The gastrointestinal tract is uniquely sensitive to mental stress, reflecting the communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system.<br><br> I hypothesized that this relationship could be exploited to provide insight into the psychological state of an individual when lying by analyzing changes in gastric physiology. Current lie detection methods rely on non-gastrointestinal physiological changes (ie. heart rate and sweating), but are only about 90% accurate and often unreliable.<br><br> Baseline electrogastrography (EGG), a measure of the electrical rhythm of the stomach, and heart rate variability (HRV), a standard measure of sympathovagal balance, was performed in 17 eligible subjects. A "truth test" was then administered that compelled the subject to both lie and tell the truth at different intervals, during which changes in EGG and HRV were monitored.<br><br> Analysis of the results showed a distinct change in the electrical rhythm of the stomach between the baseline and lying period. The HRV did not perform as well as the EGG in distinguishing between lying and telling the truth.<br><br> The addition of the EGG to standard polygraph methods has clear value in improving the accuracy of current lie detectors. In addition to a new, potentially breakthrough method for a variety of security applications, the results also provide understanding of the complex communication between the big brain and the little brain in the stomach.<br><br>

PITCHES GO UP AND DOWN PART 2
Cynthia Alejandra Juraidini
Homer Hanna High School, Brownsville, Texas, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate from an Experience and Non-Experienced Males and Females will increase while singing the musical scale in the key of F. First, you need a Male or Female. Let her/him practice for a couple of minutes on the different pitches that are in the musical scale. When the participant is done practicing, put the Blood Pressure monitor around the upper part of any of the two arms. Before they start to sing take the Blood Pressure and their Pulse Rate. After taking the Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate, ask the participant to sing the first note that will be played in the piano or keyboard, making sure he or she is in pitch by using the musical tuner. The piano will start on a low pitch called Do. Next, ask her/him to sing Do and hold it for a few seconds, to take the Blood Pressure using the monitor and the stethoscope. Then record the results. Play the same pitch again and the participant will sing it for a couple of seconds, so that you can take the Pulse Rate. After the participant is done singing the last pitch, which is high, Do, let the participant rest for a few minutes and take their Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate of the participant. Repeat steps 1-8 with all the participants. My hypothesis was correct and incorrect at the same time.

A STATISTICAL EVALUATION OF NORTHERN PAIUTE ROCK ART FROM THE GUANO VALLEY REGION
Grant Jeffery Snitker
McNary High School, Keizer, Oregon, United States of America

Rock art of the Northern Great Basin is not well understood. Few theories about the functions of this art exist. Of the limited theories, I chose the two most prominent to analyze. The first theory is proposed by Dr. David S. Whitley. He suggests that the petroglyphs and pictographs were made by the male Shaman of the tribe and had extreme religious importance. The other theory is proposed by Dr. William J. Cannon and Mary Ricks. They believe the petroglyphs and pictographs to be scenes that illustrate practical duties such as food manufacturing and hunting techniques and were made by all people of the tribe. It is suggested that the nearer the rock art is to the habitation sites of the people, the more influential the art is in their lives. <br><br>After surveying, mapping, and then categorizing hundreds rock art panels of the Northern Great Basin, I have come to an interpretation that is a combination of the two theories. I found many examples of Shaman inspired rock art panels, but I also found panels illustrating manufacturing grains, mountain sheep, and other food stuffs. I believe that the type of rock art panel is related to its proximity to any habitation site. I have created detailed maps that include GPS coordinates of habitation sites in the area and used them to statistically analyze the rock art distribution. Perhaps this distribution can be applied as a model for all Great Basin cultures.<br><br>

IS A PICTURE WORTH A 1000 LIVES?
Cory D. Cox
Charlottesville high school, Charlottesville V.A. USA.

<br><br> Wearing a seatbelt reduces the risk of serious and fatal injuries, medical/legal expenses and lost productivity from driving accidents. Previously, I demonstrated that when signs that encourage drivers to buckle their seatbelts are put up at the exits of senior centers, seniors were more likely to buckle up, and this effect lasted for at least four years. In last year’s project I found that similar signs worked the same way, or generalized, to other settings (exits of churches). <br><br> I wanted to find out why signs work. I hypothesized that: 1) the effects of signs would be reliable, 2) signs would be more effective when seen at the beginning rather than in the middle of a trip, and 3) signs with a motivational message, a picture modeling seatbelt usage plus instructions to buckle up would work better than a sign with a modeling picture and instructions, which would work better than either a sign with a model or words alone. I observed 1,260 drivers at six intersections and found that: 1) the effects of signs were reliable across locations, time and observers, 2) signs worked similarly at exits and at intersections, 3) signs with instructions to “Buckle up” plus a picture that modeled this, worked better than either instructions or a model alone, and 4) a motivational message did not improve seatbelt use. Signs modeling and instructing seatbelt use could be very cost-effective, working 24 hours/day, 365 days/year encouraging safe behavior, saving lives and money.<br><br><br>

THE BI-ORBITAL ROTATIONAL THERAPY SWING: A NEW HOPE FOR CHILDREN WITH ADHD
Liz (Elizabeth) Anne Baker
University High School, 422 N. Arcadia Blvd., Tucson, AZ 85711 USA

This project designed, built and tested a unique therapy swing that increased the concentration and performance of ADHD children. The wide-ranging and multi-dimensional movement of the swing provided sensory integration that stimulated the Vestibular system in the inner ear and significantly improved a child’s ability to compete school-work. <br><br> Eighty elementary students participated in this blind study of the Bi-Orbital Rotational Therapy Swing. The four-cell design divided ADHD and Non-ADHD children into equal groups, and then further divided them into equal treatment versus control groups. Sex and age were equally balanced. <br><br> Students were pre-tested with a test of ten words that they copied from a chalkboard while being observed for accuracy, on and off-task behaviors, time and changes in their affect. Forty students received three sessions of swing therapy. Forty students were placed in a control group and received similar, non-swing interaction for the same length of time. A post-test followed.<br><br> Analysis of the data revealed the concentration and performance of all students improved significantly (from .005 to .000 level) on all measures, except time. And, the improvement of ADHD students who received treatment was even more highly significant in these areas. Whether a child was on a stimulant medication or not, made no significant difference in the effectiveness of the swing.<br><br> Based on my results, it was concluded that the Bi-Orbital Rotational Therapy Swing was effective in improving the concentration and performance of all children treated and, in particular, children with ADHD. This project sets a mandate for further research.<br><br><br>

STANDARD FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING PROTOCOL FOR THE STUDY OF NEURONAL RESPONSES TO FOOD STIMULI IN HUMANS
Daniel E Katz
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY, United States of America

The neural network responsible for appetite regulation and food ingestion is currently being redefined to incorporate sociocultural and integrative factors. Functional brain imaging now allows for in vivo observation of brain activity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), yet there is no existing standardized protocol for appetite-related changes. This experiment aimed at creating this protocol and examining the neural network associated with hunger. Twelve subjects were scanned using fMRI after being exposed to target food objects or non-food objects via visual and tactile sensory trials. A standard block design was used to eliminate extraneous activation not related to strictly food objects through a series of conjunctions and subtractions between each of conditions (Food or non-food, visual or tactile combinations) computed to find final activation levels. Food-related activation tended to yield more activation than did non-food (mean ± SEM, 2147 ± 548 vs 1304 ± 329, P = 0.06). The neural network was located to contain activation within the cerebellum, middle frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, superior parietal lobe, and sub-gyrus.

ORIGINS OF MASS POLARIZATION IN THE TUCSON ELECTORATE
William Amado Green
Rio Rico High School, Rio Rico, Arizona, United States

It is known that the Tucson/American electorate is highly polarized. Several reports from independent agencies and research institutions have been released stating that the causes of this polarization range from one's income, to the news channel one views most frequently. In hope of discovering some of the leading causes of polarization a questionnaire was developed addressing issues ranging from the ongoing war in Iraq to one's overall fear of terrorism within the United States. Once the questionnaire was developed a random sampling of approximately 5000 registered Tucson voters was obtained and used to call, and acquire responses from 400 residents of the city of Tucson from January 25th through February 7th 2005. <br><br> Overall it appears that there are many contributing factors to mass polarization in the Tucson electorate. It is evident that a voter's perception of the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism (P<0.000 and P<0.000, respectively) as well as whether Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11th tragedy and whether there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (P<0.000 and P<0.004, respectively) were important to many voters when they decided for whom they would vote. Other factors such as, fear of terrorist attacks in the United States (P<0.000), a voters perception of U.S. military fatalities in Iraq (P<0.000), and the medium or television channel from which a voter receives news (P<0.001 & P<0.000, respectively) appear to strongly contribute to partisan polarization.<br><br>

The motive of the initial study, Aphlaebt Suop, was to determine if the ability to read correctly composed yet misspelled words (meaning all the letters of the original word are present, however not necessarily in the correct position) is present at all levels of comprehension and if all word types could be read in the same manner. <br><br>The purpose of the latest study was to determine whether the accuracy levels for each maturation level of the current test exclusively correspond with that of each maturation level in the former test, or if they inclusively correspond with that specific group of initial subjects.<br><br>The researcher utilized the former word program. The program consisted of 100 words broken down into ten categories. Only those subjects tested in the former test were used. 125 subjects were tested throughout the course of the experiment<br><br> It was concluded that the accuracy levels of each maturation level in the current test do exclusively comply nearly directly with the maturation level of the former test. It was noticed that the trends of each level in the current test almost identically match the trends of the former test in terms of maximum, minimum and average values.<br><br>Results indicated that Level 4 out performed all other levels. The combined results of both studies further indicate that at level four, individuals exhibit their highest comprehension potential. <br><br> The accuracy level of each current maturation level did comply with that of its corresponding level in the former test. <br><br><br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF ATTRACTIVENESS
Daniel Tate Verwholt
Hilton Head Preparatory, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA

The problem this experiment attempted to address was how being categorized a model or average person affects other people’s judgments. After creating a portfolio of eight pictures (4 men and 4 women of varying ethnicities), an unbiased original survey was developed. Within this survey it asked people to rate each picture in four different categories: intelligence, attractiveness, athleticism, and wealth. Once all the materials were prepared, 50 people were surveyed and half were told to rate the pictures as models, and the other 25 to make judgments based on the fact that the pictures were of average people. In order to conceal the true reason for the experimentation and make the results that much more viable, the survey was said to be used for internal purposes involving trends at a local modeling agency. Once the experimentation was done, the data was analyzed and several valid conclusions were found. On average, people rated the pictures an average of 34.3053% higher overall when they were labeled models than as average people. In order to determine whether the results were statistically significant, a two sample T-Test was performed. This type of statistical test attempts to see if there was a significant difference between two means. In every category (attractiveness, intelligence, athleticism, and wealth), the P-Value was found to be zero, which means that it can be conclusively said that there was a statistically significant difference between the ways people rated the pictures depending on how they were initially prompted. Clearly, simply inducing people to think that the pictures were of models, affected their judgments. This shows that the physical attractiveness stereotype is still alive and well and influencing our everyday lives.

TEACHER PERCEPTION OF STUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS LEARNING
Brett Tyler Figus
St. Charles West High School, St. Charles, Missouri, USA

The paper will discuss teacher perception of student attitude towards learning in class. In reasearching this, a survey was sent to teachers in St. Charles West High School. 30 teachers representing all fields offered chose to respond. This survey asked teachers to objectively rate each of their students on a scale of 1-10, ten being the best possible score. Being probed is whether or not teachers can objectively rate their students on the basis of attitude towards learning. Research indicates that in nearly every case teachers rated each student as at least 'above-average' (6 or better), and in many cases scores were considerably better.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TEACHER AND STUDENT MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES AND THE EFFECTS ON STUDENT CLASSROOM PERFORMANCE
Johanna Esther Dela Cruz
Kapolei High School, Kapolei, Hi. 96707

The purpose of this experiment was to find whether a student’s grade in a class would change based on having the same multiple intelligence. Fifty students of a history class, and sixty-eight students in a weight-lifting class were asked to fill out information regarding their sex, academy, and current grade level. First quarter grades were obtained from both teachers. Students then filled out the multiple intelligence inventory, which has a total of eighty statements. The test was tallied, and the highest multiple intelligence was determined.<br><br> A 2-proportion Z test was done for both classes. The null hypothesis is that the number of students with A’s and B’s and have the same intelligence is equal to the number of students receiving A’s and B’s and have a different intelligence. The alternative hypothesis is that the number of receiving A’s and B’s and have the same intelligence will be greater than the number of students receiving A’s or B’s and have a different intelligence. In the history class, a p- value of .043 was found, and in the weight- lifting class, a p- value of .00000281 was found, which in both cases, is extremely rare. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative is accepted. It was discovered that student with the same multiple intelligence as their teacher would receive higher grades in class<br><br>

WE GOT THE BEAT
Hubert Montoya
Andrews High School, Andrews Texas, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to find out if different types of music affected a mouse's ability to navigate and momorize a maze. Four groups of white mice were exposed to music: one group was exposed to classical music, one to rock music, another to rap music and the final group was a control group.<br><br>The first week of testing the mice went throught the maze daily for three consecutive days, with out being exposed to music, they took on an average about five minutes per mouse.<br><br>The second week of testing the mice went through the maze after being exposed to music for five hours prior to and during testing. The mice took on average about 30 seconds; the control group took 2-3 minutes.<br><br>My original hypothesis was that the classical music mice would finish first, the control group second, the rap group third and the rock group fourth.<br><br>My conclusion is that the mice that were exposed to music can navigate the maze in a much shorter time than the mice that were not exposed to music. The mice that were expsed to rap music finished the maze faster than all the other mice.

REASON AND SENTIMENT – THE SELF-REPRESENTATION OF DEHUMANIZATION IN LITERATURE
Taly Sister
Escola Brasileira Israelita Chaim Nachman Bialik, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil

The main goal of this research is to understand how the horror of the holocaust -- the systematic dehumanization of a whole population of human beings – can be represented in an effective way. <br><br> My research considered that definitions of “horror” includes indescribability and my question was how can witnesses describe the horror of dehumanization without trivializing it. <br><br> I started by identifying literary works containing first-hand accounts of holocaust. Then I selected the novel "If this is a man" by the Italian-Jewish scientist and Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi for a detailed study. Next, I identified in this work instances of dehumanization in the everyday life of a camp. <br><br> I’ve found that even within extremely dehumanizing contexts, acts of reaffirmation of humanity occurred against the external attempts to deny it. The narrator and other camp prisoners repeatedly tried to assert their morality against a context of moral debasement and devaluation. <br><br> My conclusion is that the horror of the holocaust can be represented without making it frivolous. This can be done by representing the contrast between the dehumanization process in camps and the victims’ attempts to assert their own humanity. Thus, literary reports go beyond the objective narrative of dehumanization, creating a bridge between readers’ and the witnesses’ feelings. <br><br>Such representations have an important role in preserving the subjective memory of mans efforts to assert their own humanity in adversity. The very act of writing may also have the side effect of reasserting the writers humanity, contributing also to humanize readers. <br><br>

UHEALTHY EATING HABITS INTENSIFIES MENSTRUAL CYCLE DISCOMFORT IN NORTHEASTERN PUERTO RICAN WOMEN: A PORTRAIT OF LATIN AMERICAN WOMEN
Tashay Gonzalez-Ortiz
Colegio Sonifel, Fajardo, Puerto Rico

Throughout many years people have studied the effects that outside forces have on the human body. The purpose of this project is to study the effects of unhealthy foods on the female body during the time of menstruation, if geographical placement could affect a woman's eating routines, and to prove that certain patterns emerge in women's eating habits depending on age.<br><br> To obtain the necessary information to prove the hypothesis, a questionnaire was prepared and handed out to different women of varying ages. This questionnaires asked participants who were tested about their food preferences, any positive or negative side effects they felt after consumption, the geographical placement of their homes, and which foods they tended to stay away from during the time prior or during menstruation. <br><br> After performing the necessary statistical analysis, it was shown that younger women tended to develope unhealthy eating habits which worsen the side effects felt during the time prior or during menstruation; while older women made healthier eating choices because, with experience, they knew which foods have a negative effect on their bodies.

THE IMPORTANCE OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING
Michael Gabriel Rodríguez Martínez
José Gautier Benítez High School, Caguas, PR

This investigation deals with the importance of the Emotional Intelligence or the management of the emotions in our lives. The Emotional Intelligence is a concept that has been studied recently but the findings demonstrate that it is very important. The experts in this theme say that 75 percent of the success in life is related to this intelligence and not to a high intellectual quotient.<br><br>The initial idea was to determine, how well developed is the Emotional Intelligence among youngsters from seventh to twelfth grade. The hypothesis established that there is a low level in the development of Emotional Intelligence among youngsters and this is directly related to the aggressiveness and social problems in today’s society.<br><br>To do the experiment, an Emotional Intelligence test was prepared and administered to 150 males and to 150 females from seventh to twelfth grade. A four levels scale was used to evaluate the tests. It was divided into Excellent, Normal, Deficient, and Very Bad. The results demonstrated that the females have an Emotional Intelligence more developed than the males. Based on the test evaluation scale, none of the grades presented a normal or excellent level of Emotional Intelligence. The most important finding showed that only 10 percent of these young people had an Emotional Intelligence developed. <br><br>The analysis of the data validated the hypothesis since the test evaluations demonstrated that the students do not have a well developed Emotional Intelligence. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC IN READING COMPREHENSION WITH TENTH GRADERS
Esther Morales
Ramon Quinones Medina High School, Yabucoa, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation is to determine how effective it is to listen to classical music to improve reading comprehension. The hypothesis established that students would obtain a better performance on reading comprehension tests while listening to classical music. A sample of 34 students was selected and were subdivided in two groups of 17 students each. They were identified as Group A and Group B. Two reading comprehension tests were administered under the same conditions except for the use of classical music. For the first test, Group A (experimental group) listened to classical music while reading and answering the test related to the story and Group B (control group) did not listen to music. For the second test, Group A (control group) did not listen to classical music while reading the story and answering the test, but Group B (experimental group) listened to classical music while reading and answering the test. The tests were corrected and the percentage, the medium, and the deviation standard and graphs were made to compare and analyze the results. The data reflected that both groups that listened to classical music obtained a better performance in the reading comprehension tests. The conclusion was that classical music helped to improve reading comprehension. It is planned to repeat the investigation using the same method, but with another type of music. <br><br><br><br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF PREFERENTIAL MUSIC ON THE RETENTION OF INFORMATION
Sarah Renee Kropf
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO, USA

Music has been shown to increase endorphins, relaxation, and memory while decreasing stress, depression and blood pressure. Numerous studies have been done to determine if there is a difference between classical music, mostly Mozart, silence, and occasionally popular/ contemporary music. The purpose of this research was to determine if listening to music you prefer helps you retain information. One hundred thirty five high school students participated by reading a passage and taking a fill-in-the-blank test. Prior to experimentation, participants took a survey to rank six different types of music on a scale of 1-6 (favorite to least favorite). Participants were divided into five groups of 27 students each, based on what they heard while reading and testing respectively. Here were the groups: Favorite-Favorite, Favorite-Least, Least-Favorite, Least-Least, and Silent-Silent. Data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and a significant difference was found between the group that read while listening to their favorite music when compared to the least favorite or silent groups. This suggests that listening to music that is preferred helps in retaining the information.

PROTOTYPE FOR AUTONOMY: PATHWAY FOR THE BLIND
Ameen Abdulrasool
Lane Technical High School, Chicago, IL. U.S.A.

Efforts to build and develop technology to assist the visually impaired in travel have, until recently, been limited to instruments that help individuals avoid obstacles. This experiment opted to create a portable, self-contained navigation system which would allow visually impaired individuals to travel familiar and unfamiliar environments without the assistance of guides. <br><br> A satellite navigational tool was adapted for the blind using a Global Positioning System (GPS) along with a compact flash adapter and a personal digital assistant (PDA). A voice-operated circuit was designed and created to serve as the backbone to a dual-sided sensory alert system. The complete prototype provided users with verbal and vibratory command prompts. A set of 36 selected individuals were subjected through an obstacle course to test the efficiency of the navigational tool; their errors and completion times throughout the course were noted and analyzed. <br><br> The conclusion that the GPS navigational tool adapted for the blind was truly effective can be drawn and seen in the test results by the decrease in errors made and the decreased completion time with the use of the navigational tool. The navigational tool helped reduce an average of 6.33 errors and save 25.82 minutes on the course. <br><br>

ABSOLUTE PITCH HUMAN ACCURACY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF AUDITORY TONES
Reva Lee Stidd
Macomb High School, Macomb Illinois, USA

<br><br> This experiment investigates the relationship of early musical training and absolute pitch. Absolute Pitch, or perfect pitch, is the ability to know the identity of any note from the musical scale without any references to any other note or device. For years musicians and scientists have questioned if this ability is hereditary, stimulated by environment, or obtainable with discipline. It has been predicted that those with musical training will be more inclined to have absolute pitch compared to nonmusicians trying to acquire it.<br><br> Seventeen high school students that fit criteria for three specific groups of people—early musicians, late musicians, and nonmusicians—were obtained and tested once a week over a six week time period. A tone generator played approximately seven tones within 15 minutes, and the subjects were requested to properly label each tone. Because the musicians had distinct advantages over the nonmusicians, at least 30 seconds of music was played in between each tone presented. This was done to distract the subjects and guarantee the experiment would test absolute pitch, not relative pitch. The nonmusicians were expected to prepare for each testing session by taking lessons from a helpful absolute pitch website.<br><br> Despite the fact that most of the nonmusicians did not visit the website, one subject did visit it and he did gradually improve his accuracy. The average intervals of responses for each group, however, support the hypothesis and show that early musicians are 86.5 % more accurate in providing the correct note name.<br><br>

"MY BROTHER'S KEEPER": WELL-BEING AND RELATIONSHIP EFFECTS OF HAVING A SIBLING WITH AUTISM
Christina Marie Amoroso
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, New York, United States

Although interest in cognitive disabilities such as autism has increased in recent years, this field is still relatively unexplored. Little is known about the functioning of the sibling and the effect a child with autism may or may not have on his or her sibling. The present study examined whether the presence of a sibling with autism causes difficulties (measured by Goodman's Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). The relationship between the sibling pairs was also examined using Furman's Sibling Relationship Questionnaire and compared to a matched control cohort. In all, 24 experimental sibling pairs and 21 control sibling pairs were studied. Additional variables included age gap, genders, birth order, and severity of autism (measured by Rimland and Edelson's Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist). Surveys were completed by one parent.<br><br> Results indicated that siblings of children with autism experience greater emotional difficulties than a control group. Warmth and closeness between experimental sibling pairs was dramatically compromised. Dominance and rivalry scores were also higher than those of the control group. Several significant gender differences were also found; brothers of children with autism were much more likely to be maladjusted in terms of conduct problems, peer problems, and experienced less warmth and closeness with their sibling than did sisters of children with autism. Sibling pairs in which the age gap was small (<3 years) had higher prosocial scores and fewer peer problems. Correlational analyses indicated that severity of autism may play a role in the well being of the typical sibling and the relationship between the sibling pair.<br><br>

SOUNDS INTO SYLLABLES- A TEACHING SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM
Kayla Marie Cornale
Assumption Catholic Secondary School, Burlington, Ontario, Canada

This project is intended to assist children diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder learn to read and write. To do this, I have created this teaching system, which presents language in a spoken and musical format. I did this by creating an animated computer program.<br><br>The child learns to identify the alphabet and 26 nouns by simultaneously hearing them as musical tones based on a pre-established scale. The nouns are then given further definition with pictures, sound effects and textured letters. This process is designed to activate multiple areas of the brain and in so doing improve the child’s ability to learn language. In addition, the computer program serves to conceptually link learned nouns with related verbs. The animations are presented in a story format designed to begin the transfer from single word comprehension to sentence comprehension and formation.<br><br>The test subject was my nine year old cousin who is diagnosed with PDD-NOS. At the commencement of our weekly study sessions she was unable to read or spell any letter/word including her own name. Today she spells (both verbally and musically) over 20 nouns, 5 related verbs and her own name. She has grasped the relationship between the nouns and verbs in the animations and expresses interest in the story aspect of the program. In addition, her ability to communicate and focus on the task at hand has greatly improved.

THE EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL LOANS ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES: AN INTEGRATED STATISTICAL APPROACH
Daniel Nikbakht 
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills and NY, USA 

This paper empirically examines the effects of foreign loans on the economic performance of Latin American countries from 1990 to 2003. The countries in this study are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. <br><br>The countries are classified into groups of high-borrowing and low-borrowing through T-tests. Logistic regression is conducted to verify if the economic indicators of the two groups could be differentiated. Furthermore, regression analysis is conducted to determine if there is a correlation between the level of borrowing and economic performance. <br><br>Contrary to traditional thoughts, the results fail to support a relationship between borrowings (capital) and economic performance. Strikingly, even a negative relationship is found in a few cases. The results show that capital is neither the “engine of growth” nor a sufficient condition for economic growth in Latin America. The findings of this study alert policy makers of both borrowing and lending countries in managing external financing. <br><br>

DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES AMONG CRAYFISH
Joseph James Mammone
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, USA

Dominance Hierarchies occur naturally in many different species. They occur among dogs, chickens, and humans too. The purpose of the experiment was to see if an established dominance hierarchy could be disturbed, by changing the top position or any position in the hierarchy.<br><br> Crayfish were chosen because they are naturally aggressive animals and are easy to use in experimentation. To establish the hierarchies the crayfish were separated by size and fought against each other. Once the hierarchies were formed stimulants were added in an attempt to disrupt the hierarchy. The stimulants chosen were food, light, caffeine, and adrenaline. Another method used in an attempt to restructure the dominance hierarchy was removing the most dominant crayfish. They were separated for different lengths of time to see if their memory of previous fights affected the dominance hierarchies.<br><br> It was found that once a dominance hierarchy is formed the top position does not change. Though with the addition of stimulants the less dominant crayfish do become more aggressive and defeat previously higher ranking crayfish but, the most dominant crayfish never lost no matter what the conditions.<br><br>

EDGE INTEGRATION IN HUMAN BRIGHTNESS PERCEPTION
Jonathan Yong An
Emerald Ridge High School, Puyallup, Washington, U.S.A

In 1948, Hans Wallach showed that brightness of disk surrounded by a ring depends on the ratio of the disk luminance divided by the ring luminance. Recently, more exact quantitative models have been introduced to account for the disk lightness. The one studied today is Rudd and Zemach’s model of edge integration: a hypothetical process by which the visual system combines information about the local contrast, or luminance ratio, at luminance borders within an image to compute a scale of relative brightness for the regions lying between the borders. <br><br>When two squares are surrounded by frames of different sizes, the edge integration model predicts that the relative brightness will depend on the intensity of the background field. In this project, we changed the background luminance to see if that manipulation affects the square’s lightness. This might seem surprising since the background is not adjacent to the square, and older theories only take into account the effects of luminance contrast from neighboring regions. <br><br>The observer's task was to adjust the intensity of the left (match) square to match the right (test) square in brightness as a function of the background luminance. The effect of the background luminance variations on the test square was determined by the slope of the logarithm of the matching square versus the logarithm of the background luminance. The data showed that the weight given to the outer frame edge is larger when the outer frame edge is dark on the inside (lighter background). <br><br>In summary, our data indicates that changing the background affects the lightness of a square even though it is not adjacent to the square. The data lends further support to the idea of edge integration that lightness of a square depends on a sum of induction effects derived from edges. <br><br>

A STATE BY STATE ANALYSIS OF THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM STATE LOTTERY PROGRAMS
Vanessa Elizabeth Esch
Skyview High School, Vancouver, Washington, USA

As of 2002, thirty-eight states had state lottery programs. Never has a modern state lottery been abolished, indeed they are only growing in depth and popularity. It would seem that state lottery programs are here to stay. <br><br> Hence, while all the research and argument against the existence of such programs on moral or social levels is interesting, a much better direction to pursue for those concerned with the proliferation of lotteries would be an analysis of existing programs in order to show the variables that the most efficient systems share. A preliminary analysis of just such efficiency is the whole of the following research. <br><br> This research of ‘efficiency’ is focused on finding variables which increase the percent of gross profits returned to the government programs to which the lottery is dedicated (or net revenue), as the ultimate goal of a lottery is to support government institutions. (This percent is the efficiency level.) The variables that have been researched are percent of revenue used for prizes and administration, the way in which the lottery bureaucracy is run, state populations, participation rates, and where the lottery money is dedicated. Although these variables all have some correlation with efficiency, the one variable that most drastically alters efficiency is the percent of the revenue returned as prizes. The results of this research are very applicable. Should a state wish to increase the efficiency of its program, incorporating most combinations of the efficiency variables found in this model would significantly increase net revenue.<br><br>

THE A"MAZE"ING SLEEP DEPRIVED MICE A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION
Valerie Brak
Navasota High School, Navasota Texas, USA

Studies have shown that eighty-five percent of teens do not get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation studies show that animals and humans respond to a lack of sleep in much of the same ways. This experiment will test how efficiently mice can navigate through a maze after 2, 3, and 5 hours of sleep deprivation. <br><br> First, identify the mice. Second, study the sleep patterns of all seven mice to find out when they should be deprived of sleep. Deprive the four mice of five hours of sleep using the slowly turning wheel then have the mice run through the maze. Record the amount of time needed to travel through the maze. Allow the mice to receive an adequate amount of sleep. Repeat using three hours of sleep and two hours of sleep. The other three mice should be allowed to sleep (these are the control). Have these mice run the maze one at a time. Record each mouse’s time.<br><br> When the mice were deprived of sleep, they became much more sluggish and docile. While in the maze, they would run back and forth in the section they had already passed through several times before moving on to the new section. Also, they had a tendency to stop in the middle of the maze. When deprived of five hours of sleep, they took an average of 249 seconds to run through the maze. The control mice finished the maze with an average time of 83.6 seconds. This is a difference of 165.4 seconds.<br><br> My hypothesis was proven correct. I hypothesized that sleep deprived mice would take longer to run through the maze than the mice that received an adequate amount of sleep. This assumption was proven correct by the information gathered from the experiment.In conclusion, sleep is an essential factor in learning and processing information in mice and in humans.<br><br>

SOCIAL SPACING IN JUVENILE AFRICAN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH, MORMYRUS RUME PROBOSCIROSTRIS (TELEOSTEI, MORMYRIDAE)
Samantha Breakstone
John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore, New York, United States

“Champion species” serve as models to uncover the intricate interactions between an animal’s internal hormonal and neuronal status and the environment to which it must adapt in order to survive. African mormyrid fish use multiple sensory modalities to maintain their position in space. Conditions permitting, sight and electrosense acting in concert play a synergistic role in social spacing and schooling in these fish. This project investigated the effects of group size and illumination level on social aggregation. Fish actively sought the close vicinity to conspecifics to form temporary groups and maintained the same average nearest neighbor distance of about 30-80m regardless of group size. Expression of this aggregation was much stronger in a group of 10 fish. The data showed a clear difference in the distributions of fish interacting under low light and light condition (normal and bright). Fish under bright light conditions are much more likely to maintain closer group cohesion than fish under low light conditions. These differences are discussed as the fish’s adaptation to different predation pressures from sighted predators during the day and electroreceptive predators during the night.

THE EFFECT OF THE "LEARNING BREAKTHROUGH PROGRAM" ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE
Kaitlin Graff
Henry Clay High School, Lexington, Kentucky, United States

The intent of this study was to determine the effect of the “Learning Breakthrough Program”, a structured cerebellar exercise and sensory integration program, on cognitive subjects randomized into experimental and control groups, to examine the effects on cognitive performance following a single “Learning Breakthrough” session. Second was the Case Study of a 14 year old boy with AD/HD investigating the effect of a 6 week intervention of twice daily participation in the “Learning Breakthrough Program”. The Group Study results, analyzed with a 2-tailed test using SPSS, showed no significant improvements when the experimental and control groups were compared. The other measures including cerebellar function (Finger to Thumb Test), cognitive flexibility (Stroop Test), reading fluency (Modified Analytical Reading Inventory), and handwriting (Woodcock Johnson II ACH) did not demonstrate significant comparative data. The Case Study showed significant gains in reading fluency (Woodcock Johnson), fine motor coordination (9-Hole Peg Test), and behavior as determined by parent rating (Conners’ Parent Rating Scale). Handwriting also improved but was statistically only marginally significant. Limitations of the study include the practice effect for both the Group and Case Studies. This research raises important questions about the possible role of combined cerebellar stimulation and sensory integration activities and their effect on cognition, academic performance, and behavior. Further large-scale studies are recommended to help people with AD/HD and other learning/developmental disorders to improve cognitive performance.

CRYSTALLIZED INTELLIGENCE: BENEFICIAL FOR MEMORY PERFORMANCE IN THE ELDERLY
Menaka Kaur Dhand
Spanish River Community High School, Boca Raton, Florida, United States

Memory activity may deteriorate for those over the age of 55 naturally or due to disease. The purpose of the experiment was to determine factors that may contribute to an enriched ability of recollection. Crystallized intelligence, essentially concrete information of facts, and education were hypothesized to have an immense effect on memory performance. This project was a data analysis of anonymous archival data collected from previous studies performed by other researchers. Data from memory tasks such as story summarizations and vocabulary assessments were analyzed. Data was categorized into two groups: high-level if the subject received more than 15 years of education and low-level if less than 15 years. Initially, the high-level group accomplished a score of 68.23, out of 150, on a story summarization whereas the low-level group received an average of 53.02. Furthermore, in later evaluations, the high-level group overpowered the other with the score of 83.60 to 71.73. The data was also categorized into intellectually-advanced if the subject scored above 33, out of a maximum 40, on the vocabulary assessments; the low-level category had scores of less than 33. The high-level group received an average of 65.79 on the evaluation, as opposed to the 55.23 score of the low-level. In further tests this group scored a 79.54, greater than the average of 75.27 of the low-level group. Thus, evaluations of scores revealed a positive correlation between crystallized intelligence, education, and memory performance. It was concluded that memory enhancement and maintenance are related to education and crystallized intelligence.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF 5-METHOXY-N,N-DI(ISO)PROPYLTRYPTAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE ON NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IN RATTUS NORVEGICUS
Melissa C. Selinger
Wellington High School, Wellington, Florida, U.S.

The intent of this project was to assess the effects that 5-Methoxy-N,N-Di(iso)propyltryptamine hydrochloride (5-MeO-DIPT; "Foxy"), a "designer-drug" rapidly gaining popularity, has on neuropsychological development and behavior in its recreational users. Practically nothing is known about the consequences it will have, as there is currently no published research on this substance. In response to a rapid increase in reported use, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has recieved approval to classify 5-MeO-DIPT as a Scedule I drug. <br><br>Three groups of rats (control, low-dose and high-dose) were run in multiple types of training and tests: constant-start training followed by novel-start testing and goal-rotation testing, and then Greek-cross response testing. Use of these spatial and non-spatial tests could reveal what damage the substance may have had on the serotonergic systems.<br><br>While both the experimental and control groups were able to learn to master the spatial navigation tests at comparable rates, the performance of the experimental groups were markedly inferior to that of the control animals on a response learning task, demonstrating a lack of flexibility in adapting their responses to changing task demands. Despite the varying dosage of the two experimental groups, they performed very similarly to each other, while both having a substantial difference in performance as compared to the control group. This could indicate reductions in serotonin activity in the forebrain similar to the effects of studied drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "Ecstasy"), suggesting 5-MeO-DIPT may act as a serotonin agonist.<br><br>The resulting data gives some insight to the elusive activities of 5-MeO-DIPT. The developing brains of the rats correlates to the developing brains of young adults, the core groups of users of this substance. This data should help deter people from using "research chemicals" as a form of recreation, as the long-term effects are still unknown, but the research thus far does seem to indicate the abuse of this substance may lead to neuropsychological problems in individuals who consume it.<br><br>

MAKING OUT THE MEDIA: CHOMSKY'S PROPAGANDA MODEL
William Durland Watson
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science, and the Arts; Hot Springs, AR, USA

This project is the result of a series of media experimentation on the presence of bias in media sources. The primary goal of the project was to take a large media source and test for the consistent presence of bias, and whether it adhered to Noam Chomsky’s “propaganda model.” By using a large source, like the New York Times, it was determined that an accurate and revealing sample could be obtained.<br><br>By researching Chomsky’s methods using his extensive publications, it was determined that bias could be quantified. Using the country of Colombia as the subject, the archived articles search engine on the New York Times on the Web website, the articles were quantified. The hypothesis was that the “friendly” entity, the Colombian regime, would be given more positive coverage than the insurgents or rebels. <br><br>The time interval sampled was from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004. The experiment yielded very significant results. Positive news was given in favor of the Colombian government more than any of the other entities, and the hypothesis prevailed 66.734% of the time. Material was given much less often in favor of other parties, only 29.763% of the time.<br><br>The contribution of this project is multi-purposed. First, it gave clear insight into what sorts of bias Americans absorb on a daily basis. Second, it allowed the observer to view exactly how the U.S. government influences other governments, and our own beliefs. Finally, it provides a platform for future research on the topic of media bias.<br><br>

THE PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS ON PROCAMBARUS CLARKII
Nissa Leigh Schmidt
Merino High School, Merino, CO, United States

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor’s were developed for adults and are regularly prescribed for use in adolescents. In 2004, eleven million prescriptions were issued to children under the age of 18. The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of antidepressants—specifically Effexor, Strattera and Prozac—on aggression and learning abilities in adult and juvenile crayfish.<br><br> A total of 40 adults and 36 juveniles were tested. The first test conducted was a dominance test. After the initial dominance test, the crayfish were separated and injected for five days. On the sixth day they were put back together to reestablish dominance. The second test consisted of running each crayfish through a T-maze using electric current as a punishment for wrong decisions. It was observed that in the adult crayfish, 50% of the crayfish fought, with 10% of the groups switching dominance. In the juvenile crayfish, 100% of the crayfish fought with 33% of the groups switching dominance roles. In the learning test, Prozac had the greatest effect on learning in both adults and juveniles, with none of the juvenile groups able to complete the second trial of the maze. This study shows that the SSRI’s, Prozac and Effexor, have the greatest negative effect on aggression and learning.<br><br> If this project were to be conducted again, several improvements would be made including using slightly larger juvenile crayfish as well as excluding Strattera from the study since no definite effects were noticed. <br><br>

THE EVOLUTION OF WRITTEN LANGUAGE
Anna Elizabeth Stalker
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, The United States of America

This project was designed and conducted to discover the processes that allow humans to translate the spoken sounds of language into the written symbols of an alphabet. It was theorized that visual sensory input (the seen shape of the mouth during articulation) and auditory sensory input (the sound of the utterance) played a primary role, as well as tactile input (functioning mixed with visual and auditory input as whether the utterance sounds "sharp", and then what sharp objects look or feel like, or how it feels to pronounce the utterance). A tri-part written test was designed to administer to subjects that asked them to associate spoken sounds and written symbols, create their own symbol for a sound, and pronounce symbols created by the researcher. The results were then compared to discover common patterns. The experiment showed that subjects associated the sounds and symbols in the first part of the test in accordance with the theorized articulation representation rules. The symbols created by subjects in response to the sound in the second section were all similar and followed the same rules as the first part. The pronunciations of the symbols in the third part were also similar and followed the same rules. In conclusion, the hypothesis was accepted in every facet; written symbols are created using combinations of auditory, visual, and tactile input and are created following predictable rules.

TUNE INTO TOUCH! DO WE RELY ON OUR OTHER SENSES TOO MUCH? TACTILE DISCRIMINATION OF STIMULI
Alison Rae Ficek
Trinity High School - Dickinson, ND - United States

The purpose of my project was to determine how well human individuals could develop their sense of touch, without relying on their other senses. This process included a method called tactile discrimination of stimuli, which means using the sense of touch to determine the differences between objects. My first hypothesis is that there will be a significant difference between male and female touch perception, based on the discrimination of stimuli. To determine if there is a significant difference between male and female touch perception, I will calculate a t statistic test. I feel that the group of females that I will test will have better tactile perception, compared to the males. My second hypothesis is that as human subjects develop their sense of touch, the ability to discriminate tactile stimuli will progressively get easier.<br><br> I designed a display board for experimentation. This featured a human-like hand with twelve compartments, which contained stimuli. Forty eight human subjects were seated and blindfolded. They were tested on discrimination of stimuli. Test stimuli varied through size, texture, and shape. Comments and scores were recorded on survey sheets.<br><br> After analyzing experimentation data, I came to two conclusions. The males I tested had an eight percent higher score, than the females. By calculating a t statistic test, I have proven that the male and female touch perception were NOT significantly different. Therefore, my hypothesis was rejected. Tested participants sense of touch seemed to be enhanced as tactile learning levels progressed. Therefore, my second hypothesis was accepted. <br><br>

MALES VS. FEMALES PERCEPTION OF A BOY/GIRL RELATIONSHIP
Kayo Johnson, John Johnson, Earth Robinson
Greenville-Weston High School, Greenville, Mississippi, USA

Society has placed a gulf between males and females by using a cliche' that states, "Women are from Venus and men are from Mars." Through this project we plan to bridge certain aspects of this gap. As we began to plan our project, we first determined which parts of this gap we wanted to bridge. After several hours of critical thinking, we decided to find out whether males and females perceived of a relationship in the same way. Not only did we want to know their perception of a relationship, but also how they would respond to certain instances in a relationship.<br><br> In order to find out how males and females think, we devised a questionnaire. We then gave twenty students, ten males and ten females of the same age group, the survey. After the students finished the survey, we complied the data. First, we did this by separating the male and female surveys. Then we tallied the answer of each question of the survey.<br><br> Males and females, according to the data received, perceive of certain occurrences within a relationship in the same way. Moreover, males and females are not so different when it comes to perception of a relationship. In turn, this eradicates the cliche' that men are from Mars and women are from Venus. However, the way in which we choose to portray our emotional perceptions are far removed from one another.

Soquel High School, Soquel, CA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of physical appearance on personal approachability. We hypothesized that physical appearance would affect people’s perceptions of each other and impact their choice of friends, preferred students and potential employees. We selected one boy and one girl and dressed them up in five different outfits, each one based on a stereotypical image. We took ten photographs of each different look. We devised a simple poll to determine which stereotypical image people preferred and identified three subgroups to query: high school students, teachers, and parents. We then asked high school students to review the photographs and choose the person they would most like to have as a friend. We asked teachers which person they would prefer to have as a student. Finally, we asked parents which person they would hire for a job. Results showed that appearance did affect a person’s approachability and that image did affect people’s choice of friends, preferred students, and potential employees. Students and teachers preferred one image overall others (T-shirt, jeans, clean-cut, sporty image). Parents preferred the professional image overall others as a potential employee. We concluded that physical appearance and image affected the choices people make regarding friends, preferred students, and potential employees.

GENDER DETERMINATION BY THUMBPRINTS
Shannon Marie Cassidy, Meryl Hulteng
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, Oregon, United States of America

This experiment was designed to test the possibility of determining gender from a fingerprint. The science of fingerprinting has become an easy way to identify people from crime scenes to finding missing persons. Preliminary research did not indicate that gender can be determined from fingerprinting. The hypothesis stated that at least one print characteristic would surface as an aid in distinguishing the gender of prints.<br><br>Thumbprints were taken from a group of 25 males and 25 females. The prints were analyzed using a system keeping the gender unknown during evaluation.<br><br>Analysis determined that males tended to have a higher ridge count than female subjects. When comparing type of prints to ridge count and gender, common patterns were discovered. From this a classification system was created to determine the probability of a gender. We were able to designate probable male and probable female thumbprints. Those with a low ridge count and right loop were probable female prints and those thumbprints with a whorl and high ridge count were probable males. <br><br>Due to the sample size, it is believed that similar results would be found if the experiment was repeated. <br><br>If gender could be determined via fingerprint, it could prove important to criminal investigators, by speeding processing drastically. For instance narrowing down the suspect pool; prints taken from a crime scene could be prioritized when knowing the suspects gender. <br><br>Plans have been made to collect more prints for further analysis and research.

WHO HAS BETTER COORDINATION: MUSICIANS OR ATHLETES?
Danielle Marie Strausbaugh, Jessica Reile
Upper Sandusky High School, Upper Sandusky Ohio, United States

The goal of the research is to see whether or not students that practice music on a regular basis will have better hand-eye coordination than students who practice an athletic activity on a regular basis. The basics of coordination: memory, rhythm, timing, and intricate hand movements are taught to children when coordination is first being developed. Memory, rhythm, timing, and intricate hand movements are also very large components in both athletic activities and music. If both contained the same basic skill, could the components be put together? The hypothesis is that students who practice musical instruments on a regular basis will have better coordination than the students who practice athletic activities on a regular basis. The experiment consists of gathering fifty students who practice athletic activities, fifty students who practice musical instruments, and fifty students who do not practice either of the aforementioned. All students will be of high school age between fourteen and eighteen. The student will trace a pattern while looking in a mirror. This will test the student's hand eye coordination. Based on the results obtained, the musicians had the better coordination with an average of 7.16 buzzes per thirty seconds. This research that was conducted could prove that playing music can better one's coordination and be used to better the development of the growing process.

The research had as target to ecologically sensitize the community in a low class district in São Leopoldo/ RS/Brazil.The target population was children from kindergarten to third year of elementary school of a public school in this district.Environmental education approached trough practical and theoretical methodologies as a transverse, multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary theme. Lectures and gymkhanas concerning the community’s current themes, such as: domestic garbage, vector animals, biodiversity and marshes were promoted.A primer was also written with suggestions for environmental activities to be used by the teachers in the classroom.Through the obtained result in the form applied before and after the research with students and teachers, and in the gymkhana tasks the method was evaluated. This evaluation used indexes, which involved the form answers before,and after the sensitizing, number of teachers who developed environmental activities, students engaging as environmental monitors and the relation of students to teachers engaged in the project.The results were considered to be satisfying once that:43,75% of the researched students had interest in taking part in a volunteers group of environmental monitory, when the aim established was of 25%.40%improvement in the students'correct answers to the sensitizing forms,for an aim of 40%.The teachers’ engagement was a little low, 45%.The aim was of 80%.77,14% of the children who engaged on the environmental monitory were students of teachers who used the approach proposed by the research, thus showing that the method is efficient for an 80% aim.The conclusion is that it was possible to ecologically sensitize the students from first to third grade in the low wage community using the proper method. In one next stage the teachers shall be more trained and sensitized separately. The sensitizing shall be longer; with more students family interaction, maybe with parents as environmental monitors.<br><br>

It’s more frequent to see, nowadays, how a lot of adolescents consume great quantities of alcoholic drinks. The alcohol is a drug with which the ocidental society has learnt to live with, and now the youngest population has broken its control capacity. To consume is a permanent and abusive activity, and this occasions problematic situations proper of the intoxication with that substance.<br><br> From this foundation the following disquiet comes:<br><br> Which are the main consequences originated by the alcohol abuse in students adolescents between 16 and 18 years old in Gualeguaychú? To elaborate the previous theoretic frame reference, different bibliographic sources and the every day fact observation have been used; the following hypothesis could be formulated:<br><br> “The main consequences that the alcohol abuse bring to students adolescents from Gualeguaychú, is mainly manifested in biologic and social aspects.”<br><br> To verify it, different methodological techniques have been applied: written documents analysis, surveys, interviews, journalistic advertisements synthesis, observations, etc. From which data elaboration we could get the following conclusion:<br><br> “Among the main consequences that the alcohol abuse in students adolescent from 16 to 18 years old in Gualeguaychu the following fact stands out:<br><br> In the biologic aspect:<br><br>. Physical problems: general sickness (equilibrium lose)<br><br>. Psychological problems: neurological system alteration (memory lose, lose of coordination thinking-action)<br><br> In the social aspect: <br><br>Problematic or violent situations with his/her environment (quarrels, lack of control)<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This is the third stage of a research that started four years ago, its objective is the Human Development in Romang.<br><br>During the previous stages we researched about:<br><br>a) The local Human Developments level.<br><br>b) Whether the economical benefits from agriculture would provide resources to the improvement to the urban rates of Human Development.<br><br>The general purpose of this project is to investigate whether Education would contribute to the improvement of Human Development. The starting point is to answer the following questions:<br><br>a) What is the impact of Education on the local Human Development?<br><br>b) What is its priority in the district budget?<br><br>Following the scientific research stages we used comparisons on human groups of same age and social background but with different level of education; case study about sibling sharing the same economic, intellectual and educational opportunities in which one of them has studied and others haven’t; research on official resources and census; informants; surveys; analysis of district budget; H. D. N. P information. The outcome of the research was: education strongly benefits H. D. because it contributes to a healthy and decent life, since it improves economic income of people and stimulates the public matter participation. On the other hand, it is not perceived a priority on the district budget; as it was stated in the hypothesis.<br><br>Projections are oriented to propose greater investment on Education, by the rationalization and optimal allowance of resources, with the purpose to revert the stagnation in the local Human Development.<br><br><br>

TIME TO GET UP: DOES SLEEP DEPRIVATION AFFECT THE FRONTAL LOBE OF THE BRAIN?
Jose David Lopez, Mayra Martinez
Andrews High School, Andrews, Texas, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the lack of sleep affects the activities of the Frontal Lobe of the brain. Our experiment involved sixteen different people, eight male and eight female. The test subjects were required to stay up until a certain time at night, then awake at a certain time in the morning. They were then tested using an X-Box game system. The results were collected and written down. The subjects had to get eight hours of sleep, five hours of sleep, three hours of sleep, and no sleep. They were tested three times under each of the amounts of sleep. In the overall average, kills and deaths were around the same range in the periods of 8 hours and 5 hours. In the time periods of 3 hours and no hours the kills and deaths are varied. In the time period of no hours of sleep, there was a great difference. There was a lot more deaths than kills. They had real slow reactions to the things that were going on in the game. It was harder for them to make quick decisions and focus on what they were doing. They had a short-term memory and their concentration level was low. We came to the conclusion that when a person is sleep deprived it does affect how their brain functions. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THE RHYTHM OF BACKGROUND MUSIC ON ICONIC MEMORY AND TWO PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS ON 15 TO 17 YEARS-OLD STUDENTS
Luis Abner Lopez-Febres, Priscilla Martinez-Rosario
Dr. Gilberto Concepcion de Gracia High School, Villa Fontana, Carolina, PR

Most students have difficulties in learning as demonstrated when a new concept or skill is taught in school. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if the rhythm of background music played on a flute has an effect on iconic memory and two physiological indicators (blood pressure and pulse) on 15-17 years-old students. The researchers expected that an increase of rhythm would produce stress on the subjects which in turn would decrease the number of items that they could recall and increase their pulse. Sixty students were evaluated considering their age, gender, handiness and academic achievement. The experimentation was divided into three steps. First, the subjects answered a questionnaire. Then, they entered a sound-proof room and observed fifteen items on card A during fifteen seconds. After that time, they told the researchers the items they recalled. No music was heard at this time. Next, they observed cards B and C, while listening tapes one and two. A flute was used for the melodies taped. In step two, the subjects heard a moderato rhythm, increased to allegro rhythm in step three. The physiological indicators were measured by a digital instrument before and after each treatment. Data was collected and analyzed statistically. The results did not support the hypothesis significantly. The lateralization of the left-handed, the greater tolerance of males towards increased rhythm of music and the effect of maturation on 17 years-old subjects suggested that other factors operated during the experiment. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AGE AND GENDER ON COGNITION RATES THE STROOP EFFECT
Saima Akheel Zaman, Reema Farasat Chaudhry
Potomac Senior High School, Dumfries, VA, USA

Abstract<br><br>We chose to experiment on the Stroop Effect and its effects on gender and different age groups. The Stroop Effect refers to the disturbance caused by trying to eliminate meaningful but conflicting information from a task, even when the information is irrelevant or counterproductive to the task. Disturbance is experienced when a person tries to say the color a word is printed in when that color does not correspond to the actual name of the color. For example, “mental interference” is experienced when the word “blue” is printed the color “green” and a person tries to say the color “green”. We chose to experiment on the Stroop effect because we found the whole concept of “mental interference” and the ways in which our brains function interesting. Five males and five females from each age group were timed while they read a control chart and named the colors the words were printed in the Stroop chart. It was determined that females have lower reaction times than males with respect to naming the colors in the Stroop chart. There was no specific pattern when it came to the control chart. The time taken to read the control chart and to name the colors in the Stroop chart for males and females decreased from the age group of 4-6 to 16-18, increased from 16-18 to 40-55, and decreased again from 40-55 to 60+. If this project were to be conducted again, we would perform more trials with more colors and narrow down the age groups.

THE EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER ON PERSONALITY TRAITS IN TWINS
Brittany Alison Koffer, Rachel Elyse Koffer
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, Virginia, United States

The Effects of Birth Order on Personality Traits in Twins was designed to find out whether birth order affects the following personality traits: dominance, competitiveness, and temperament. In order to do this, ten sets of identical twins, fraternal twins, and siblings were recruited. A series of tests was administered to each set individually, including three written tests and one interactive game. <br><br> The data from the tests was collected and analyzed. In the first dominance test, the first-born twins and siblings scored more dominant. The data from the second dominance test was meant to reinforce the first. The results were similar for twins, but the siblings’ data was inconclusive. The second test was judged inconclusive due to the small number of questions. The interactive game, testing competitiveness, showed both types of first-born twins were more competitive than the second-borns. In siblings, the first-borns were less competitive than the second-borns. The temperament test resulted in a majority of ties amongst all types of sets, although the number of ties in fraternal twins and siblings were less than those in identical twins. <br><br> The data led to the conclusions that dominance is affected by birth order, where the first-borns of the sets are more dominant. Twins and siblings are affected differently by birth order for competitiveness. The first-born twins are more competitive than the second-borns, while the first-born siblings are less competitive than the second-borns. Temperament was not found to be affected by birth order.

This experiment is based upon the behavioral analysis of testing eighty different thirteen to fourteen year old human subjects to discover whether personality has an effect on the type of learning style prominent in each subject method of short-term<br><br>memorization.<br><br>Each subject is administered a David-Keirsey Temperament Sorter II Personality Test to determine which of the sixteen personality types the subject appropriates. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning style tests are administered. The visual test displays a verse of twenty-nine characters that the subject has five minutes to memorize by reading the text off the test sheet. The subject is given five minutes to rewrite the verse in grammatical and contextual perfection. The auditory test allows each subject to listen a verse that is repetitiously read aloud for the duration of five minutes. Five minutes are given to rewrite the verse in grammatical and contextual perfection. The kinesthetic test allowed each subject five minutes to physically perform or act out another twenty-nine-character verse in aide of memorization. The subject has another five minutes to rewrite the verse in perfection. Completing the experiment the grammatical and contextual errors are analyzed and used to determine if each personality type has a prominent learning style.<br><br>According to the concluding analysis, each personality type is dominant in one of the visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning styles and the results are as follows: ESTP-visual, ISTP-kinesthetic, ESFP-kinesthetic, ISFP-visual, ESTJ-auditory, ISTJ-visual, ESFJ-auditory, ISFJ-auditory, ENFJ-visual, INFJ-kinesthetic, ENFP-auditory, INFP-auditory, ENTJ-visual, INTJ-visual, ENTP-visual, and INTP-visual.<br><br>

DETECTING THE AGGREGATION PHEROMONE OF ARMADILLIDIUM VULGARE
Jason Lavar Anderson, Clara Grace Watson
Grenada High School, Grenada Mississippi, United States of America

The purpose of the project is to determine if the aggregation pheromone of Armadillidium vulgare is contained in the fecal matter of males, females or both genders. We believe that the aggregation pheromone is located in the fecal matter of A. vulgare. The procedure consisted of the following: researching information on pheromones; creating a habitat for A.vulgare; collecting A.vulgare; placing groups of 15 specimens male,female,and both genders in weighing dishes to collect fecal matter; constructing a multiple choice arena; placing fecal mattter of mixed groups in one end of the arena; placing males and females in the arena for 10 minutes; recording the number of males and females on the end with the fecal matter; repeated the procedure for male and female fecal matter. The results show that a higher ratio of Armadillidium vulgare aggregate in the area where fecal matter is present. The results also show that males tend to aggregate around their own fecal matter as well as the female fecal matter. Females aggregated only around male fecal matter, and avoided their own. The hypothesis,based on the results indicates that a pheromone is present in the fecal matter of A.vulgare. The chemical nature of the aggregation pheromone has not been determined. When a suitable solvent for the fecal matter is found, it is believed that a gas chromatograph will indicate whether or not there are in fact two seperate pheromones.

CAN ART EXPRESS A PRESCHOOLER'S EMOTION WHEN WORDS FALL SHORT?
Luciana Brink Ranelli
Duluth East High School, Duluth, Minnesota, USA

This study tests whether complex emotions not yet in a preschooler’s vocabulary can be expressed in a drawing. Three-minutes of Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony-Adagio were recorded on a cassette tape. The experiment was conducted at two Duluth preschools one subject at a time in a room separate from other activities; subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subjects in the drawing category had four crayons (red, blue, yellow, purple) and drew while listening to the music; subjects in the verbal category verbally stated how the music made them feel while listening. Specific follow-up questions for subjects in each category included selecting a figure showing emotion (happy, angry, sad) that best represents how they are feeling, and if a drawer, an explanation of his/her drawing. The sample included 60 subjects (29 drawing, 31 verbal) ages 33 mos.-5 yrs. More drawing subjects than verbal could give support for their answers regarding color choice and emotion. Twenty-three verbal responders either could not talk about their emotions or what the music made them think about; all but 5 drawing subjects could explain how they were feeling. Verbal comments were scattered, which illustrated how hard it is to pick just one emotion and explain it. The content of drawings did not matter as much as the subjects’ focused ability to explain their emotion while referencing back to their drawing. Results show it is easier for preschoolers to talk about how they feel if they have previously drawn to music.

THE SOCIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE LIVING WILL ACCORDING TO VARIOUS AGE GROUPS
Stephen T Hallet
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, Florida, Hernando County

The purpose of the experiment was to find out which age group has the most living wills. The researcher conducted surveys using 30 subjects per age group. The questionnaire was the same for all subjects in the survey. The results of the questionnaire showed the youngest age group had the least living wills with the numbers of living wills increasing along with the age group, showing the oldest age group with the most.<br><br> There are many factors that could have an affect on a subjects answer: subject suffered a loss, was stressed out, hungry, thirsty, or sick at the time. The individual subject’s knowledge level of the topic could also have affected the results.<br><br> The researcher calculated from the surveys the following statistics to support his hypothesis. The researcher received 42 or 28% of yes responses from the 150 subjects that they had a living will. Of the 42 yes responses 3 or 7% were from the 18-25 age group, 6 or 14% were from the 26-35 age group, 6 or 14% were from the 36-45 age group, 8 or 19% were from the 46-55 age group and 19 or 46% were from the 56 and older age group.<br><br> <br><br> The researcher recommends conducting a survey to determine the percent of subjects who have a regular will. This outcome would probably be attributed to a subject’s financial assets and stability. The researcher believes that the subjects with more financial assets would more likely have wills, regardless of their ages.<br><br>

COMPARING THE BENEFITS OF A TACTILE MANIPULATIVE VS. A VISUAL AND/OR AUDITORY STIMULUS ON COGNITIVE RECALL, THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION AND ANALYSIS.
Jessica Caroline Stanton
Columbia High School, Lake City, Florida

Would using a tactile manipulative be more beneficial than writing information down, or listening to information? I believe that “writing” in a textured substance will affect students’ short-term memory in a positive way. <br><br>The experiment will begin when the student is told that he/she will hear a list of numbers. The researcher will also explain that she will be using a turntable filled with beads. A calculator will be used to find 6 random numbers. These numbers will be called out to the student and he/she will “write” the numbers in the manipulative. The researcher will talk to the student for thirty seconds about unrelated topics. She will then ask the students to recall any numbers that they “wrote” in the beads. The test will be repeated with one exception. The student will be using a pencil and paper to write the numbers. In the last test, the student will have no form of writing down the numbers that they will be given. <br><br>The tactile manipulative was greatly beneficial when in comparison with both the visual stimulus as well as the auditory stimulus. Out of 96 participants, 24% more subjects recalled four or more numbers in the tactile test than in the visual test, and 59.4% greater than the auditory test. The validity of this study was found through a statistical hypothesis test. <br><br>This project will affect all classrooms. It could also be applicable to the armed forces and other government organizations.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS SIX SIGMA METHODOLOGY HAS ON ONLINE EBAY BUSINESSES
Shiyu Xu
Winona Senior High School, Winona MN, United States of America

Six Sigma Methodology is a process used by manufacturing companies to increase their profits. The basic principle of Six Sigma Methodology is this: increase consumer confidence (by using DMAIC or other processes) to elevate a business’s Sigma level and to raise a business’s revenues and profits. Since online shopping has been developing rapidly and has been losing revenues to inefficiency, this study is aimed to find out whether Six Sigma Methodology would increase an Ebay business’s revenues and profits. First, two Ebay stores were set up. Then, E-store A served as the control to represent a typical Ebay store. E-store B’s description page was customized by DMAIC to implement the elements of Six Sigma. Finally, they each sold nine products. Once Six Sigma Methodology elevated E-store B’s consumer confidence level, its revenues were on average18% higher than E-store A’s, and its profits were also relatively higher. Therefore, Six Sigma Methodology did boost the Ebay store’s revenues and profits because consumers who were more confident were willing to pay more for the products they buy.

NAME AND ITS AFFECT ON PERSONALITY/SOCIAL TRAITS, CAREER, AND ATTIRE
Liesl A Swoyer
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, Florida, USA

Personalities, careers, and clothing interest many people, but the extent of the effect name has on them remains unacknowledged. The hypothesis states that a name will affect the personality/social traits, career, and attire of a person. A survey, using information acquired through extensive research of literature, articles, and the Internet, was made to satisfy the HIPAA laws, ISEF rules, and other applicable regulations. The survey was reviewed and approved by two psychologists and the SRC to ensure minimal risk. The survey was administered to high school students between the ages of thirteen and eighteen. The survey focused on name, occupation, personality/social traits, and attire. <br><br> The hypothesis was proven to be correct. By comparing Kabalarian control names with the survey results, it was proven that male and female students are affected by their name. In males, it was proven that name affects personality/social traits by 95.7%, employment by 89.6%, and clothing by 74.3%. In females, it was proven that name affects personality/social traits by 94.6%, employment by 88%, and clothing by 74.1%. Male subjects were 1.1% more affected by name than female subjects. Other statistical analyses were also completed. Over 50% of the subjects were female, resulting in an uneven balance of sex as well as of age. The results of the experiment could be useful in psychology and psychiatry, when considering a person for a job, when considering possible career interests, and in naming a child. <br><br> <br><br>

WORKING MEMORY INTERFERENCE EFFECT ON VISUAL ERP'S
Mary Margaret Brinkopf
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL USA 

This experiment was designed to test how working memory is affected by interference and non-inference stimuli dependent on two levels of memory load. My hypothesis examined if working memory differentially influenced sensory components of ERP in visual cortex (P1, an event related potential waveform) when making cognitive decision about target matching status. Furthermore, is the visual cortex activity to target matching affected by task-irrelevant interference and does the effect vary in working memory load? Lastly, do patients with high fear differ from those with low fear in either of the above statements?<br><br> In an independent research project, subjects viewed distracter stimuli composed of five valences. The subject pressed M if the probe matched the previous cue diamonds or N if it did not match. I analyzed the resultant data when the subject observed the probe and its transmittance from the eye to the visual cortex. Next, an ANOVA statistical analysis was completed which revealed little deviation in valence conditions in phobic subjects but a difference in the control group. Nevertheless, the phobic subject’s error rates remained substantially higher than the control group. <br><br> My original hypothesis was rejected because valence failed to cause a deviation in the P1 of the phobic subjects; therefore an alternate hypothesis was formed. It states: valence conditions will not have a significant affect on the sensory components of phobics due to their heighten anticipation and stored visual memory of feared object.

EYEWITNESS ACCURACY
Mariah Lynn Stanley
Titusville High School, Titusville Fl, Brevard

The purpose of this project was to determine if there is a significant difference between males and females with respect to eyewitness accuracy. I conducted a scenario in 17 different science classrooms at my high school. I ran two different tests with a total of 400 students responding to my surveys. In the first test, I had the female test subject walk into the classroom and interrupt the teacher at the front of the room. The female test subject would then continue to talk to the teacher for exactly three minutes. Once the female test subject had exited the room, I would then enter the classroom and hand out the survey form to the respondents. I explained how the respondents were to fill out the survey forms specifying that they were to still fill out the survey even if they did not see the test subject. The surveys were collected immediately upon completion to prevent the respondents from discussing what they observed. The process was repeated with a male test subject. The data from each of the survey questions were statistically tested for significance (95%). I used a two-population z-score statistics test. The null hypothesis (HO) was that the answers from both the males and females would be the same; the hypothesis (HA) was that there is a difference between both male and female respondents. The responses were statistically significant for 3 of 7 questions for the male test subject and 4 of 7 questions for the female test subject.

DOES THE ODOR OF CHOCOLATE STIMULATE MEMORY?
Adrienne M. Heintz
Bradenton Preparatory Academy, Bradenton, FL, USA

I conducted this experiment in order to discover if the odor of chocolate had any memory-enhancing properties that affected humans. I believe that chocolate will enhance the memory of humans, and it exposes a new technique for people trying to remember things. <br><br>I located an online memory game and gave the test to twenty subjects, once without smelling anything, and once after they smelled ground-up chocolate for thirty seconds. I gave each person a sheet with clear instructions on how to take the test both with and without smelling the chocolate to avoid confusion. I discovered that the average time for the first test was 2 minutes and 50 seconds, and the average time after smelling chocolate was 2 minutes and 14 seconds. This shows a 36 second improvement, or 21.2%. The data supports my hypothesis.<br><br>This experiment opens up a new window of research on memory. I believe there was a lot of room for improvement in my project, however. The subjects could have performed better on the second test only because they became more comfortable, so I should have given the test 5 times with and without chocolate and taken the averages. Also, I tried to isolate each person while they were taking the test in order to eliminate distractions, but because I did most of my testing at school, it was hard to administer the test when there was absolute tranquility. The last thing I believe would have improved my project was to test more people than I did. <br><br>

<br><br>The project focused on the influences of the migration phenomenon on the mentality, social conduct, behavior, values and lifestyle of children (8-14 aged) whose one/both parents work abroad, whereas they keep living in their original habitat.<br><br>Based on the investigation data, the project aimed to help development of special councilling programs for those children who are negatively affected by the absence of their parents and to foster legislations initiatives to protect them by setting parents' obligation to solve children care, before their leaving the country.<br><br>The topic and the outline of the research followed the next hypotheses which were finally confirmed by the data interpretation.<br><br>1.Children whose parents work abroad are more likely to internalize their parents model of leaving the country.<br><br>2. Children whose parents work abroad are exposed to a higher risk of socio-school deviation.<br><br>3.Children with parents working abroad are more likely to suffer from lack of affection.<br><br>4. For the children in the families where migration is encountered, the spare time budget (the loisir) suffered some changes. A part of the spare time is affected by supplementary tasks, derived from the missing parent domestic choruses. <br><br>The survey (643 respondents) and observation were chosen as methods of the research and questionnaires and observation forms completed by teachers were preferred as instruments.<br><br>The data interpretation confirmed the hypotheses and led to the conclusion that families with one/both parents abroad do not provide an ideal emotional and educational environment for the children left home. <br><br>

TESTING SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY IN STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED SOCIETIES
Edie Marie Uyesugi
Paoli Jr/Sr high School

Social contract theory is the thought that social orders (societies) have standards, known as morals or ethics that guide behavior for members. These rules, rights, and responsibilities are implicitly agreed upon by virtue of membership in the society. They are not legislatively determined but behaviors accepted commonly to be “right.” <br><br>This project tested this theory in two types of societies. The structured society was a high school and two churches. These settings were considered structured because members of these groups traditionally have accepted sets of moral guidelines. The unstructured society settings were a large mall and several public streets. These were considered unstructured because it could not be assumed that people in these settings had commonly accepted moral behavior codes. The researcher dropped a dollar bill in a society and observed the reaction. Data from this experiment came only by observation. The money was returned, kept, or left on the ground. Returning the dollar was the only interaction between researcher and society members.<br><br>The hypothesis was that people in structured societies would return the money more often than in the unstructured. Data supported the hypothesis. One hundred and thirty reactions were recorded from each society. In the structured society 93% of people returned the money and in the unstructured 15% returned it. Results were analyzed using a Z test for significance. <br><br>Understanding human behaviors and factors that influence it is of great value, because it could help predict how members of society will act in certain situations.<br><br>

IS AGE A FACTOR OF THE STROOP EFFECT?
Jerrica Lynn Williams
Benjamin E. Mays High School, Atlanta, GA, United States of America

The Stroop Effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When a word such as blue, green or red is printed in a color differing from the color expressed by the word's semantic meaning, a delay occurs in the processing of the word's color, leading to slower test reaction times and an increase in mistakes. <br><br> The purpose of my project is to determine if age is a factor of the Stroop Effect. I hypothesized that age is a factor of the Stroop Effect. I deem the Stroop effect will have the greatest impact on people between thirteen and twenty-five.<br><br> Fifteen subjects in each age group were asked to participate. The subjects were placed in a chair and two stacks presented in front of them so that the cards faced the participant. As the participant named each color correctly, the index card was removed, revealing the next card. The procedure for "Stack 2" was the same as it was for "Stack 1." <br><br> The seniors citizens that participated had the most trouble with the Stroop Effect. The average Stroop Effect recall time for pre-teens was 22.70 seconds, while the average senior citizen's recall time was 34.48 seconds; this is a difference of 11. 78 seconds. The average recall time for adolescents when asked to name the color of the random letters was 19.22 seconds, while the elderly, when asked to do the same, had a time of 28.61; this is a difference of 9.39 seconds.<br><br>

ANIMAL CARING - AN EDUACATIONAL PROPOSAL
Anelise dos Santos Klein
Fundação Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo - RS, Brasil

In order to create an association of protection to the animals that works, several aspects must be observed, between them the community’s effective participation. But since it will wake a respected feeling and protection to the animals in a society where these actions are not stimulated. <br><br> Theories of the psychology emphasize to be in the childhood in which we build our character. From these data the question was formulated: Is it possible to organize an educative program for children that contributes to the development of respected attitudes with the animals? On basis of the aforementioned factors it was prepared a method of playful teaching of informative character to instruct the children of as they might treat the domestic animals. <br><br> The method intends to stimulate the children to have a good familiarity with the animals from activities that develop his creativity and imagination. This method was implemented firstly in an institution of childlike teaching. After the knowledge of the quite satisfactory results, a cd-rom was produced with informations of introduction of this program, which will be distributed in the public schools. <br><br> The project was developed through a descriptive research of field. The data were obtained through the use of the children in the proposed activities, of questionnaires carried out with teachers, psychologists, vets. <br><br> With the conclusion of this stage it was noticed that it is possible to wake in the children a feeling of care with the animals and change the way as they react in the environment where they lives.

THE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION ON THE REM SLEEP PERIOD
Caroline Anne Blosser
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, United States

REM sleep is essential to daily necessities such as memory, learning, cognitive ability and daily performance, and growth and repair. The purpose of this project was to observe the effects of caffeine consumption on the REM sleep period of the human sleep cycle. It was hypothesized that moderate to significant caffeine consumption in both male and female adults between the ages of 16 and 55 would both decrease the length of individual REM periods, and decrease the number of completed REM periods each sleep session. To test this hypothesis, 34 subjects participated for three days in recording hourly food and drink consumption, as well as general information relating to their sleep behaviors each night. Subjects were divided into two separate categories based on daily caffeine consumption; 17 subjects who did not consume caffeine and 17 moderate to high consumers of caffeine. In addition, each individual was required to wear a REMView® sleep-monitoring device each night that recorded the length and characteristics of the REM sleep period. <br><br> It was concluded that caffeine consumption has no significant affect on the number of completed REM periods each sleep session. However, evidence suggests that caffeine decreases the length of each individual REM period. These results imply that caffeine consumption may prohibit or delay the REM period. In addition, caffeine may actually withdraw an individual out of REM sleep prematurely. Future studies are needed to determine how significantly caffeine consumption affects REM as compared with other variables. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF MUSICAL TRAINING ON THE CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION OF MUSICAL SEQUENCES
Alysha Harper Owen
Dallastown Area High school, Dallastown, PA, United States

The cerebral cortex of the human brain is the site of high processing where sensory stimuli are perceived, processed, and acted upon. There are two cerebral hemispheres, and each is functionally different. In most right-handed people, the left hemisphere is specialized for linguistic and sequential processes, whereas the right hemisphere is specialized for spatial and holistic processes, including musical perception.<br><br> Learning to read and play music may change musical processing to a linguistic-type task. The hypothesis of this experiment is that musical training will change the discrimination of tone sequences from a right hemisphere task to a left hemisphere task.<br><br> Twelve right-handed subjects (six musicians, six nonmusicians) were tested. Two tests were given: a word recognition test and a tonal sequence test. In the verbal test, two different words were presented by headphone simultaneously to each ear (dichotic stimulation). After each question, the subject would select an answer from an answer tape. The music test was presented similarly, using the dichotic perception of two different three-note tone sequences.<br><br> As expected, on the verbal task there was a right ear/left brain advantage compared to the left ear/right brain (62% accuracy verses 55% accuracy.) On the musical task, there was no significant difference between musicians and nonmusicians. In fact, both musicians and nonmusicians showed a slight right ear/left brain advantage for recognizing tonal sequences. The hypothesis was therefore not supported.<br><br> Multiple reasons, including small sample size, unreliable music task, and technical difficulties with tape synchronization could have influenced the outcome of this experiment. The hypothesis is still felt to be plausible and worthy of further study.<br><br>

SUBJECT EYEWITNESS MEMORY OF PHOTOGRAPH STIMULUS BASED UPON LONG AND SHORT RESPONSE QUESTIONS POSED
Pioneer Cole Winter
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami FL, United States of America

This experiment studied efficiency of eliciting information from subjects. Subjects (n=89) were randomly seated and recieved one of two questionnaires: one had three long response questions (Group L), followed by a fourth long response "critical question" and one with three short response questions (Group S), followed by the same critical question as Group L. Both Questionnaires ended with a filler task, eliminating one group's finishing first, which potentially pressures subjects into abbreviating information, or alert them of questionnaire variation.<br><br>Measurements for groups' first three responses were disregarded; attention paid solely to critical response word count. Subjects studied the same photograph stimulus for 45 seconds and then responded to the questionnaire.<br><br>Originally hypothesized, Group L would have greater word count in the critical question from three-question practice; however, data displays Group S has higher mean word count (28.65) than Group L (22.93). Two Sample T-Test resports the probability level Group L is less than Group S is .037583. In gender, Group L has nearly equal word count (females slightly higher), with a 4.257 mean difference. Group S had a mean gender difference of -1.41 (males higher).<br><br>Results duggest Group S did better than Group L, who may have experienced memory barrier or confusion of details applied. Group S may have been primed through the short response questions, perceiving it required to give lengthy responses. This theory of eyewitness memory and behavior presents efficient ways to minimize misinformation and maximize recall effect, with application to aiding in military and law enforcement interrogations.

THE EFFECTS OF RACE, AGE, AND GENDER ON SPATIAL BEHAVIOR AN OBSERVATIONAL PROJECT CONDUCTED ON THE D.C. METRORAIL
Anne Kelly Minoff
Yorktown High School, Arlington, Virginia, U.S.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of race, age, and gender on human spatial behavior. Spatial behavior is defined by movement in reaction to surrounding objects or people. Human spatial behavior around strangers is informed by implicit associations and attitudes towards "in-groups" like race, age, and gender. In this experiment, Metro riders' seating choices were used to represent the characteristic spatial behavior of members of different in-groups towards strangers. It was hypothesized that the races, ages, and genders of Metro riders would have a significant effect on seating behavior, with passengers of common race, age, and gender choosing to sit together more often than apart. Of the in-groups considered, it was hypothesized that gender, followed by race and then age, would have the greatest effect on spatial behavior.<br><br>Ten hours of observation were conducted on the D.C. Metrorail (Washington D.C.'s subway system) to test the hypothesis. The gender and approximate age and race of each passenger to sit down was noted, in addition to the characteristics of the person he or she sat next to. Ninety-one interactions were observed. It was shown that the majority of Metro riders preferred to sit with women, Whites, and riders close to their own age. However, Chi square tests run on the data supported the null hypothesis, showing that associations between race, age, and gender were not statistically strong. The rejection of the hypothesis could indicate either that Metro riders' spatial behavior is not strongly informed by implicit associations and prejudice, or that sitting on the Metro does not represent the degree of spatial invasion necessary for implicit associations to significantly affect spatial behavior.

THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION ORGANIZATION ON MEMORY RECALL
Alexander Cary Wilkerson
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA, United States

This experiment’s purpose was to compare two information organization methods – chunking and hierarchies. These methods were compared with a controlled standard to show changes due to organization technique. It was believed that greater organization and meaning in information would elicit greater recall. Subjects in the sample group were randomly assigned into three equal groups. Subjects in group one, two, and three received unorganized information, information organized by chunking, and information organized by hierarchy, respectively. All subjects received a recall form. Subjects had ten minutes to study the information. Immediately afterwards, the subjects hid the information forms and recalled the information on the recall form. Forms were collected; recall forms were scored as a percentage recalled of the total information studied. <br><br>Differences in sample means showed greater recall for the chunking organization compared to the unorganized information, but t-intervals with a 95% confidence level were inconclusive about population means. T-intervals showed a significant difference between hierarchal organization and unorganized information. The three data sets had different levels of variability. Groups one and three had similar interquartile ranges and similar standard deviations. Group two had an IQR that was about three times larger than the IQR’s of group one and two and a standard deviation that was nearly twice the size of group one’s. The measures of center showed a trend of increasing percentage recalled with increasing organization. The data were distributed roughly symmetrically. Group one was slightly skewed right by a high outlier; groups two and three were slightly skewed left. <br><br>

THE ABILITY TO RECALL: MALE VS. FEMALE
Hannah Elizabeth Reid
Upper Sandusky High School, Upper Sandusky, Ohio USA

The purpose of this research is to find if there's a difference between male and female recall. Memory is the brain's ability to store or retrieve events, pictures, words, etc.The brain codes each memory, then files it away into the hippocampus and temporal lobes or the cerebral cortex: storing the memory.The hypothesis for this experiment is that when presented with photographs, women will remember more details then males. The approach was to use seven 4"x6" photos in color, black and white, and with a variety of details to test the memory of an equal qroup of males and females from the ages of 14-60. The amount of details the person could remember after one minute was recorded onto a sheet of paper. A comparison was made of each subject's entries. At the conclusion of this research, a majority of the males were found to have only given a general overview of each photograph. The majority of the women gave a more descriptive entry for each photograph. Based on the results of this experiment, women have a greater memory for detail then men do. However, a small amount of the men were able to recall in equal proportion to the women. Based on research, there are some males with very good memory ability, but females have a greater ability to recall detail. In society, this research would prove useful to people and corporations involved with the education and marketing of products and materials towards certain genders.

IT'S NOT AS EASY AS 1-2-3: LIMITS OF THE HUMAN ABILITY TO COUNT
Jake Baron
Stuyvesant High School; New York, NY; USA

The ability to quickly count a group of objects is something we often take for granted, but counting is more error-prone than it may seem. Human counting ability was investigated using a computer paradigm that presented dots, enclosed in a rectangle, under three visual conditions: 1) central presentation, 2) peripheral presentation, and 3) peripheral presentation with distracter dots surrounding the rectangle. Even under the easiest condition (central viewing), one can accurately count only up to 3 objects in a glimpse. Presenting the dots peripherally and surrounded by distracters invoked visual crowding, which radically impaired counting accuracy. Under this condition, the standard deviation of observers’ counts is increased by about +2 at every number of dots presented, compared to central viewing. This impairment is especially drastic for small numbers of objects (fewer than 4) since without crowding the standard deviation is zero in this domain. These results indicate that when an array of objects is crowded, we cannot reliably count even 1, 2, or 3 objects. Each object must be fixated individually, one at a time.

THE CONTEXT EFFECT OF SENSE STIMULI ON DECLARATIVE MEMORY
Samuel Jang
Nicolet High School, Glendale, Wisconsin, United States

The purpose of this research is to test the context effect of the change in various environment set by sense stimuli on declarative memory. Context effect gives differences in subjects’ performances depending on whether the conditions present during learning and later remembering are either matched or mismatched. Context effect is important because it can improve memory. People use senses everyday and this research tests the effect of sense stimuli. The sense stimuli considered in this research are color, odor, and taste. <br><br>For the sample test on the context effect, subjects are given three types of test environment. Under the SAME environment subjects are given the same environment as that of learning. Under the NO environment, subjects are given an environment without sense stumuli (white color, no odor, and no taste). Under the DIFF environment a set of different environment from the learning environment is presented to subjects. The sample size of each test case is 20, and two types of word list are used for two days.<br><br>The statistical analysis on the result lead to the conclusion that testing under the SAME environment gives no statistically significant context effect over the NO environment. Testing under the SAME environment, however, gives statistically significant context effect over testing under the DIFF environment.<br><br>

THE VISUAL GLOVE CONSTRUCTING A LOW-COST HAPTIC FEEDBACK DEVICE
Ahmad Shakir Manshad
Las Cruces High School, Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States

The goal of this research is the development of a new low-cost haptic feedback device for visually impaired, blind and deaf-blind persons allowing them to visualize graphical information such as mathematical graphs. This device is a glove consisting of six vibration motors, five are places on top of each finger, and one is placed on the back of the palm. The vibration from each finger represents a direction to reach a graph on a grid depending on current glove position. Through constant movement according to given direction, a person is able to reach the graphed function and is able to visualize the graph. The directions are controlled through the software which I developed to graph pre-algebra functions and uses algorithms to determine directions. This software collects user time, clicks, and directions to analyze glove performance. The results showed that visualizing a graph through tactile sensation using the glove is much faster than through acoustic feedback at the 90% significance level. Thirteen visually handicapped students tested and approved the usability of the glove. The visual glove is significantly less expensive than existing haptic devices.

THE DEPENDENCE OF IMAGE RECALL AND RECOGNITION ON PIXEL SIZE IN HUMANS
Granton A. Jindal
Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Baton Rouge, LA, USA

An important ability of the human brain is to recognize pictures. A sharp picture is made up of a large number of small regions of uniform illumination called pixels. What enables the brain to recognize a human picture more efficiently? Absolute pixel size or pixel size in relation to key features of the face? I think it is the latter. For experimentation, I selected two pictures A and B for each of 19 individuals. Using a computer program I redesigned based on last year's research, I generated photos A1-A7 from each picture A. These pictures were made by combining pixels in groups (reduction factors) of 1, 4, 9, 16, 36, 64, and 256 respectively. I gave human subjects a complete set of B-pictures. Then, starting with the lowest resolution, I showed photos A7-A1 until recognition was made. I found that recognition is possible at poor picture quality minimizing file size for storage applications. I also found that Indian subjects recognized Indian and American pictures about the same while American subjects recognized American pictures better than Indian pictures. I also observed that close-up pictures were recognizable at larger reduction factors. However, the improvement in reduction factor became weaker exhibiting a logarithmic dependence at higher zoom, when critical features were being cut off. At the recognition point, all pictures had about the same number of pixels in corresponding key features irrespective of pixel size, supporting my hypothesis. For better recognition, the viewer must be familiar with ethnic features. This has homeland security applications.

I have examined the effect of reminding pupils of their grades in this examination on their performance in mathematics and logic test. I have discovered significant effects on pupils’ performance in this test in 14 and 15 year old pupils in a Catholic Grammar school.<br><br>The experiment was planned with 120 pupils in year 11 (14 to 15 years old), 53 were boys and 67 were girls<br><br>Pupils were divided into 3 groups, one group were to experience the gender stereotype threat, another the 11+ treat and the final group was a control group.<br><br>Each pupil was presented with a test paper which had their name on the front and contained an answer grid with a code that referred to the pupils’ sex and 11+ grade. On the front of the answer grid was a stimulus which the pupils had to respond to before commencing the test. Pupils had to write a short paragraph in response to the stimulus explaining whether or not they agreed with it and why. Only the answer grid was collected so that the test results were confidential.<br><br>

SOUNDS INTO SYLLABLES(TM) II WINDOWS TO THE WORLD OF CHILDHOOD AUTISM
Kayla Cornale
Assumption Catholic Secondary School, Burlington Ontario, Canada

To assist children diagnosed with autism, I created a teaching system called Sounds into Syllables™. It is based on the premise that various musical components can assist these children with their linguistic and social development difficulties.<br><br>This project represents the second phase of the system in both method and application. Harmony is introduced with the creation of six 3 part harmonies that are linked to the six universal emotions of happy, sad, afraid, angry, surprised and disgusted. Three 2 part harmonies have also been created and linked to the concepts of nouns, verbs and adjectives. These harmonies have been integrated into a children’s book (also in computer format) created specifically for the system and titled The Story of Little Bear.<br><br>It is designed to assist these children with face perception, recognition of emotional expression and to stimulate interest in the human face so as to improve their social interaction with others. It also addresses sentence construction by teaching nouns, verbs and adjectives within a series of simple sentences.<br><br>The conclusion that musical harmony can assist these children with social and sentence construction difficulties can be drawn from the progress of the nine year old test subject. She has demonstrated enhanced face perception and recognition of emotional expression, wishing to imitate expressions on her own face by using a mirror. Her primary interest in the story is with the changing emotions of the central character Little Bear. <br><br>

GAME THEORY AND STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR: A STUDY OF BEHAVIOR IN STRATEGIC SETTINGS
Lucia Seda
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico 

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what game theory could reveal in decision making situations involving limited information. Game theory principles such as negotiation, positioning, establishing strategic analysis, eliminating indecision and managing complex situations have been thoroughly delineated and employed worldwide. Each of these five characteristics assisted in evaluating games and its particular information. In order to apply game theory postulates and confirm the belief that game theory helps in understanding strategic situations, three “games” were designed to measure mathematical analysis, critical thinking and probability examination by high school students from tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades. These questionnaires were administered during class time for a limited period of time of five minutes per game, where the player selected his option and explained his reasoning. The results were grouped according to grade, gender, answer and whether they were left handed or right handed, to prove if there existed a parallelism between answers and a correlation between variables. The results were analyzed using Paired and Unpaired Student T-Test as well as Chi Square. Significant answers were found in the Newcomb’s Problem Right Hand Sample and the 99% Accuracy Test in both the Left Hand and Right Hand Samples. In the Monty Hall Problem, the results were equally paired, in the Newcomb’s Problem the majority of the players chose both boxes and in the 99% Accuracy Test the majority chose to be concerned. Thus, this study asserts that people do not employ correct mathematical analysis, but rather instinct reaction.

CEREBRAL DOMINANCE: DOES IT AFFECT ACADEMICS?
Jenna Kathryn Johnson
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville Minnesota, United States

High-school students’ academics are influenced by many factors, but they are primarily shaped by instructors. If a teacher schools right-brained students in a predominately linear matter, or if an educator attempts to teach left-brained students with divergent concepts, the students in these situations would not be learning to their full capacity, and the teaching strategy could therefore have a negative impact on academic performance. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was any correlation between cerebral dominance and scholastic achievement. Surveys were given to forty-five high-school students to determine their hemispherical dominance, and to record their grade-point averages. While sixty percent of those who took the survey were right-brained, the conclusion indicated that left-brained students had significantly higher GPAs, as a possible result of their linear processing ability and of the teaching methods used in high schools.

THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF GASOLINE PRICES
Henry Jathuren Neilson
Saint Michael's Academy, Bryan, TX, USA

The purpose of my project was to find which factors influenced gasoline prices in Bryan and College Station, Texas during September and October, 2005. I examined the effects of amenities, day-of-the-week, competition, traffic volume, and location variables plus daily wholesale prices on retail gasoline prices. Through this project I was able to test the supply and demand model and find out why some stations have higher gasoline prices than others.<br><br> My project consisted of data collection followed by statistical analysis. I collected price data twice daily for two months from 28 gas stations along with station characteristics and GPS coordinates. I obtained traffic count data from TxDOT and wholesale prices from the internet. I ran panel regressions to isolate the impact of individual variables on gasoline prices.<br><br> I hypothesized that stations with brand names, more amenities, better access, increased traffic flow, and less competition have higher gasoline prices, and that retail prices change in the same direction but not as quickly as wholesale prices. I also tested to see if day-of-the-week, time-of-day, or location mattered.<br><br> Restaurants, convenience stores, and distance to the closest competitor had positive impacts on gas prices at the 90% confidence level or higher. Traffic volume had no impact, but location did. Gasoline prices were lowest on Mondays and highest on Fridays. The wholesale price coefficient was between zero and one, as hypothesized. Prices tend to rise faster than they fall. My project shows that competition is a key determinant of gasoline prices.<br><br>

WORD SEGMENTATION IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION: ASSESSING AMBIGUITIES BETWEEN WORD OFFSETS AND TRANSITIONAL PROBABILITIES
Riana Juhn Betzler
The Fox Lane High School, Bedford, New York USA

The process of language acquisition begins in the infant mind before birth and progresses at such a rapid rate that by the first year of life, infants have reached the level of understanding at which they begin to produce speech and be understood by the outside world. Yet, language acquisition is an indefinably complex and involved process, the fundamentals of which, researchers have barely begun to understand. Aural language contains a complex grammatical and phonological structure that the learner must recognize and acquire.<br><br> In a previous study, we investigated the abilities of adult learners to use transitional probabilities (statistical frequencies inherent in the grammatical structure of language) to segment a continuous speech stream of artificial language. The results of this research indicated that subjects were able to correctly segment the speech stream based on transitional probabilities. However, ambiguities arose within the data results in regard to the effect of word offsets and onsets as an influence on subjects’ ability to correctly segment the speech stream. <br><br> This research seeks to investigate the power of word offsets and onsets in determining where word boundaries exist in the continuous speech stream. A novel was presented aurally to participants, followed by a testing session, in which participants were asked to identify the word from the novel language.<br><br> Although results have been inconclusive as of yet, discrepancy between word onset or offset cues and transitional probabilities occurs even within natural language. Thus, this research gives us insight into how we resolve ambiguity inherent in natural language.<br><br>

ATTENTION IN THE BRAIN: A STUDY OF COGNITIVE CONTROL USING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Maggie Delano
Ossining High School, Ossining NY, USA

This study investigated cognitive control of the Stroop and Simon tasks using functional MRI. Conflicting task dimensions on a given trial trigger cognitive control mechanisms that lead to increased selective attention on the next trial, so that conflict is resolved more efficiently. It is undetermined whether cognitive control triggered by one type of conflict leads to superior resolution of another type of conflict. Stimuli included the words "red" and "green" written in red and green ink located to the left or right of a fixation point. Stimuli were presented to subjects in an fMRI scanner. Reaction time, accuracy, and fMRI images were recorded. Interaction effects between the Stroop and Simon effects did not reach significance (f(1,12)=.1, p=0.947; f(1,12)=.4, p=0.543), indicating that cognitive control did not generalize across different types of conflict. In the Stroop contrast of cognitive control, significant brain activation was located in the inferior-parietal lobule, frontal regions, the postcentral gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus. In the Simon contrast, the pre-central gyrus, post-central gyrus, parietal regions and fusiform gyrus were activated. There was minimal overlap in brain areas responsible for resolving Stroop and Simon conflict. These results may aid in improving the assessment of specific impairments in attentional control.<br><br>

VISUAL ILLUSIONS AS TOOLS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
Esther Pustil'nik
Israeli Arts and Sciences Academy- Jerusalem, Israel.

Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that affects approximately 1% of the world’s population. Its most striking clinical aspect is psychosis, characterized by hallucinations and delusions. Even today, there is no comprehensive neurobiological theory of this complex disease. Traditional studies have focused on certain sub-cortical areas and on the prefrontal cortex. However, motivated by recent theories, I chose a different approach. My work concerns various aspects of visual perception in schizophrenia. In particular, I focused on perception of stimuli that are usually associated with perceptual illusions. Using a battery of computerized tests, I characterized the perception of a wide range of visual illusions in schizophrenics compared to control subjects. The tendency to experience hallucinations and sensory distortions suggested that visual illusions would have a more pronounced effect on schizophrenics. However, the actual results showed an overall tendency among the patients not to perceive the illusions! Qualitatively, the data indicated deficits in spatial integration, figure-ground segregation and top-down control.<br><br>The results of this experiment stimulated a new hypothesis, namely, that the underlying neuronal substrate is dysfunctional connectivity in certain visual areas. To verify this hypothesis, I performed additional specific quantitative experiments, which corroborated the previous results. Moreover, one of these experiments suggested that the dysfunction is specific to long-range lateral interactions in the visual cortex. This is consistent with recent evidence for myelin-related dysfunction in schizophrenia. In addition to providing insights regarding brain functions that are compromised in schizophrenia, this study can be useful for diagnosis as well as for novel therapeutic strategies.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE ON ADOLESCENTS
Supal J. Desai, Supal Desai
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL, USA

The goal of this project is to determine the effects of television violence on adolescents. Research has shown that there is a clear link to violent television and prolonged influence on individual’s behavior. This study analyzed the behavior of two populations of high school students, measuring both costisol levels and behavioral responses. <br><br> Students at the school were divided into two groups. The control group sat quietly for 30 minutes reading an article. The experimental group was shown 30 minutes of war created scenes that exhibited various degrees of violence. Saliva samples were taken prior to dertemine the subjects’ reactions to violence within the media. Parents were also surveyed to determine the amount and type of media the subjects are exposed to. Using cortisol antibody, immunocytochemical studies were done on the saliva samples. Immunoblot analysis was also used to determine relative amounts of cortisol before and after the study, using a secondary anti-cortisol antibody with a horseradish-perocidase tag to visualize the cortisol on the blot. <br><br> The result showed that the experimental group had a significantly higher elevated cortisol level after watching the cartoon when compared to the control groups. Male and female responses were analyzed and showed that the females had a higher level of response when compared to the males. However, males showed a higher initial level due to their increased viewing of television watched by the subjects. This supports the initial hypothesis of desensitization to television violence. <br><br> Additionally, this correlation is demonstrating that the males, who watched most television, had the highest initial levels of cortisol, contributing to that desensitization.<br><br>

THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL RELIGIOUS COMMITMENT ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, HOPE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADOLESCENTS
Sarah Batya Joselow
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY, United States

Religious commitment has been shown to have positive impacts on adolescent academic achievement, hope, and quality of life. However, previous research has not focused on either ethnically or religiously representative samples. In addition, it has not examined the impact of separate aspects of religious commitment on the lives of adolescents. The purpose of this study was to extend available literature by focusing on a more diverse sample and differentiating between separate aspects of religious commitment. Questionnaires were distributed to 539 adolescents, aged 14 -21, from a diverse high school in suburban New York. Questionnaires contained 36 multiple choice and free response questions compiled from the previous works of Sethi and Seligman (1993) and Smith and Faris (2002), which evaluated subjects' demographic groupings, self-identified hope and quality of life, and level of religious commitment as determined by various aspects of religious participation. Belief in God was negatively correlated with GPA (F=.159, p=.036, Mean difference=4.497). Hope and quality of life were positively correlated with frequency of prayer (r=.162, p=.000) and sense of connection to God (r=.207, p=.000), though these findings were inconsistent when the sample was disaggregated by race and religious affiliation. These findings suggest that the impact of religion on adolescent academic achievement, hope, and quality of life is highly dependant on both racial and religious affiliation.

PLAYING MONOPOLY: DOES THE SHELF-LIFE OF A PRODUCT AFFECT THE EXTENT OF COLLUSION AMONG ITS SELLERS?
William Alexander Johnson
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL, USA

This project looks at how the length of a product’s shelf-life affects the extent of collusion among its sellers. Collusion refers to the phenomenon of sellers cooperatively keeping prices higher and selling fewer products than at the competitive level; this benefits sellers but is detrimental to society and is generally illegal. What this experiment addresses could be an important matter in antitrust cases.<br><br> My hypothesis is that the sellers of products with longer shelf-lives are more likely to attempt collusion. Attempting to collude is risky, and sellers of products with longer shelf-lives feel less pressure to sell what they have as soon as possible, making them more willing to take risks. <br><br> My hypothesis was tested using human subjects in experimental markets, with imaginary goods but real economic incentives. The markets proceeded through several trials. In half the markets, the “sellers” were allowed to keep in stock any goods that they were unable to sell before (this represents a long shelf-life); in the other half of the markets, the sellers had to sell their goods during the trial in which they bought them (this represents a short shelf-life).<br><br> The Competitiveness Index of the short shelf-life condition was 29.98%. The long shelf-life condition was negative 14.87% competitive, a difference of 44.85%. According to a T-Test, I can conclude with 93.3% confidence that my hypothesis is correct. Perhaps the formulas used in antitrust law should take into account the shelf-life of the product in question.

SOCIAL DISORDER CURES ON THE HORIZON? A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN ON SOCIAL MEMORY
Katie Lane Patterson
Tuscumbia High School, Tuscumbia, Missouri, United States of America

<br><br> Social memory allows animals to recognize their parents, siblings, and appropriate sexual partners. Oxytocin and vasopressin are neuropeptides that have been suggested to impact social memory. Recently oxytocin levels have been found to be low in boys with autism, suggesting a relationship between neuropeptides and social disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on social memory in male and female mice.<br><br> To conduct the study, thirty mice were separated into three treatment groups: control (five males and five females), experimental 1-oxytocin (five males and five females), and experimental 2-vasopressin (five males and five females). To determine the effects of the neuropeptides on social memory, a novel mouse of the same gender was introduced and allowed to interact with the test subject. The social interaction and the investigation times were recorded. The novel mouse was then removed. After thirty minutes elapsed, the same novel mouse was reintroduced. The behavior and interaction times were recorded.<br><br> Based on this study, the following conclusions may be drawn. Both neuropeptides enhanced social memory in mice. Vasopressin was the most effective treatment. There was very little difference in social memory when comparing male and female mice. <br><br>

HOW DO PEOPLE FORM ADDICTIONS AND ARE THEY HEREDITARY
Kristina Argo
Central High School Brooksville Fl US.

Addictions can take on many diffrent forms and consume anyone who gives anything of substance a chance. In the researchers opinion, addictions are not based on heredity, but based on the choices people make and also on the environment you live in. The purpose of this project was to disprove the theory that addictions are hereditary. This hypothesis will be tested by creating and conducting a survey that will reach the age group of 18-45. The individuals involved were asked to complete a twenty-five question survey that will extend no longer then about eight minutes. The surveys were collected and evulated. Only reaching Hernando county resdents, this survey that the researcher has created has made people think about the addictions that they were never certain about or aware of. The results of the survey were utulized to evulate the formation of addictions in the human brain. The survey was grouped based on age, ethnicity. From the grouped individuals, more people were willing to take the survey were caucasian males between the ages of 18-20. For this experiment there were numerous types of charts made full of data. According to the overview of the data numerous amounts of people who came off like they had an addiction, denied to even having an addiction at the end. In final analyisis the researchers hypothesis was inconclusive. Further research and usage of test subjects will further advance this project.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE YOU WILL FEEL VERY SLEEPY" MYTHS AND REALITIES ABOUT HYPNOSIS
Michael Gabriel Rodriguez
Jose Gautier Benitez High School, Caguas, PUERTO RICO

<br><br> This investigation presented a study about the myths and the realities that exist about hypnosis. During many years hypnosis had been considered as one of the best techniques to treat phobias, bad habits, addictions, and anxiety, among other problems. Nevertheless, at this moment it has a low credibility because of some incorrect information presented through mass media. Therefore, it was decided to do an investigation to determine the knowledge that a common citizen has about hypnosis. To do the study, a questionnaire was designed in which the participants would answer several questions related to hypnosis. A sample of 400 participants older than 18 years was selected to answer the questionnaire. The study was done in schools, communities and public places in order to have a highly diversed group of participants.<br><br> After analyzing all the data, it was possible to demonstrate that the hypothesis was correct. Only 25% (1:4) of the participants really knew what was hypnosis. In spite of it, the majority of the participants (p=0.717) had the desire to be informed about this technique. That detail is very important because in this study it was also verified that the probability that the people with knowledge about hypnosis would let themselves be hypnotized is greater than the people without a clear knowledge about it (p=0.535 and p=0.299, respectively). That means that good campaigns with correct information about hypnosis could help to get people interested in the use of hypnosis for their own benefit.<br><br>

ATYPICAL VISUAL BEHAVIORS AS EARLY INDICATORS OF AUTISM IN CHILDREN
Maya Nina Wolpert
Hathaway Brown, Shaker Heights, Ohio, USA

This study is designed as a preliminary assessment of the role of atypical visual behaviors that occur in young children (between ages one and two) and eventual diagnosis of autism or a related pervasive developmental disorder. A previous study by this researcher assessed the frequencies of 100 atypical behaviors symptomatic of autism in a population of children and found atypical visual behaviors to be the most commonly occurring in the youngest children (ages 18-32 months). For this study, then, a ten-item, anonymous questionnaire was created containing five questions related to atypical visual behaviors and five questions concerning other developmental milestones, specifically regarding behaviors included in already validated measures used in evaluating children with possible autism. It is important to note that the subject sample for this project was completely different from the previous year's study, and all information collected was new.<br><br>The subject sample comprised two groups of parents: 1) those with children currently between 2 and 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with autism or related disorder and 2) those with “typically” developing children within the same age range being seen for medical care in an outpatient clinic. <br><br>The results indicate that atypical visual behaviors may enhance the predictive value of a diagnostic tool, when combined with other non-visual behavior questions. Future research is needed to further refine the role of atypical visual behaviors in evaluators’ complete and accurate diagnosis of children with autism.

THE IMPACT OF ATTACK ADS ON PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS DURING THE 2000 PRESEDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
Michael Brett Katz
John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore, New York, United States of America

Previous research has offered mixed indications of whether or not negative ads are effective in helping a candidate win an election. Some studies have shown that negative advertising is better remembered and thus more effective in shaping a voter’s impression of a candidate. Other studies suggest that negative ads may have a boomerang effect that hurts the candidate. No previous study has examined the real-time attitudes of voters in response to ads that individuals were exposed to in the midst of an election. I compared data on the frequency and dates of negative ads from the 2000 Presidential Election with pre- and post-polling data, corresponding to the dates of the negative ads. The results indicate a novel finding that with an increased frequency of negative ads, the general favorability of attitudes toward the candidate employing the negative ads increase, while general favorability of attitudes toward the opponent decreases. Future research will need a more extensive polling database and will need to measure the different effects of negative campaign ads on different demographics. An in-depth study into the effect of the new 527 groups should also be conducted.

THE COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIKELIHOOD TO USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Allison Erica Dender
Plainview Old-Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School Plainview, NY USA

The public understands that renewable energy is better, safer, cleaner and good for the environment, but still generally opposes the use of renewable energy because of misconceptions that it does not work, is experimental or too risky (Whitley, 2005). Therefore, this project focuses on designing a survey, called the AELK (Alternative Energy Likelihood and Knowledge) Scale, to determine whether an individual’s knowledge, their misconceptions and/or their natural resistance to change impacts their likelihood to use alternative energy. The AELK Scale consisted of a Resistance to Change Scale (Oreg, 2005), a Likelihood Scale (Hart Research Associates, 2005) and a Knowledge Scale compiled from various sources. Three hundred AELK surveys were distributed nationwide to adults for a total sample size of n=248. <br><br> Chi squared tests showed a significant relationship between an individual’ s knowledge of alternative energy and their likelihood to use alternative energy (p =0.003) as well as an individual’s resistance to change and their likelihood to use alternative energy (p=0.000). T-tests showed no significant difference in an individual’s likelihood to use based on their sex, age, level of education, and incomes. The most applicable finding is the relatively low level of knowledge of alternative energy; mean value of 18.3 out of 93. Hence in order to increase people’s likelihood to use alternative energy, it is essential to increase their knowledge of alternative energy. <br><br><br>Hart Research Associates, Peter D.

IS MATH JUST FOR BOYS? GENDER DIFFERENCES IN DROPOUT RATES AND ATTITUDES OF ADVANCED HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS STUDENTS
Christina Chung-May Tu
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY, 11577, United States

Many studies have found evidence of a gender gap in mathematics. In the first study, archival data of six graduation classes at a mid-sized suburban high school were analyzed. Once in high school, girls were more likely to withdraw from (p < .05) and less likely to enroll in (p < .005) the most advanced mathematics courses than boys. A follow-up study investigated possible explanations for this gender gap. One such explanation involves students’ attitudes toward intelligence and effort. Incremental theorists believe intelligence can be increased, whereas entity theorists believe intelligence is fixed. During the 2004-2005 school year, students who were, or had previously been, in the highest level math track were surveyed about their implicit theories of intelligence, achievement goals, and self-perceptions of effort in order to compare the girls and boys who dropped out with those who remained. Of the students who remained in the most advanced mathematics courses, male incremental theorists earned higher grades than male entity theorists, whereas female entity theorists earned higher grades than female incremental theorists (p < .01). Students who remained in the class held more positive self-perceptions of effort than those who withdrew (p < .05). Most notable, however, was the lack of any gender differences in implicit theory of intelligence. This study suggests that while boys are more likely to persevere in high level mathematics courses in high school, the reason behind this gender gap is not related to perceptions of mathematical intelligence and effort.

THE EFFECT OF FRAMING AND DESCRIBED TASK DIFFICULTY ON EXPECTATIONS AND PERFORMANCE
Michael Elliot Hofer
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY, United States of America

Over the last decade, standardized testing has become increasingly prevalent. This experiment sought to determine how framing and described task difficulty affect students' performance and their expectations of that performance. After reading a statement concerning how participants in previous classes performed on a test about trees, students were asked to rate how they expected to perform. In addition to varying the frame of the statement (positive or negative), the experiment manipulated the described difficulty of the task (high or low). Performance was operationalized by a Tree Test on which participants had to list as many types of trees as they could. It was found that students had higher expectations when the statement was positively framed (p < .01) and described as easy (p < .05). In addition, there was a significant interaction between task difficulty and framing on performance such that positive framing led to better performance when described task difficulty was high, whereas negative framing led to better performance when described task difficulty was low. Additionally, a weak, positive correlation was found between expectations and performance. This information is helpful in understanding how framing and described task difficulty, among other external factors, influence performance on tests and possibly other types of tasks as well.

SPONJ- THE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE SUITE FOR CP CHILDREN
Sinchan Banerjee
Clear Lake High School, Houston, Texas, United States of America

Cerebral Palsy is a neural disorder that is marked by physical and cognitive difficulties, and I had the opportunity to work with children suffering from Cerebral Palsy this past summer. Living through routine activities with these children, I realized that they were sorely in need of a software program that could cater to their unique needs. Thus, I set out to develop an educational software program, called SPONJ, and a typing interface, called IntelliScribe Intellectual Interface, that is proficiently suited for the needs of Cerebral Palsy children. I have done this by making a special mouse-motion-recognizing interface called the ArtificialNavigator. <br><br> With the aid of numerous artistic and advanced programming techniques, SPONJ’s lessons teach arithmetic mathematics via stimulating examples, definitions, targeted questions and an entertaining game that reinforces the lessons taught. The questions were used to compile a scaled score, which verified my hypothesis. A total of 30 children, ages 6-12, tested the program for three weeks. After testing, the children’s average scaled scores of the three weeks were 2.989, 5.35, and 7.011, respectively. The children also observed that the IntelliScribe Intellectual Interface is very accessible and efficient. Their average typing speed has improved from 0.849 words/min to a remarkable 2.238 words/min. Therefore my hypothesis was proven true. The program is successful as it allows the user to gradually improve mathematics skills and typing speed. I am grateful to have been able to touch 30 lives with my software; however, with time, SPONJ has the capability to allow numerous individuals to jump over the hurdles that Cerebral Palsy has set for them.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF COGNITIVE DISTRACTION ON DRIVING ABILITY
Henry Branscomb Joe
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

Data suggests that the average driver spends approximately 40 percent of his or her time behind the wheel talking on a cellular phone. Only three states have completely outlawed the use of cell phones while driving. Thus, further research is necessary to ascertain whether cell phone use while driving is dangerous enough to influence other states to do the same.<br><br> This study attempts to determine the effects of cognitive distraction on driving ability. The hypothesis proposes that cognitive distraction greatly impairs driving skills in teens. Subjects between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one were tested using a realistic driving game system equipped with a steering wheel and pedals. Each subject’s driving ability was graded based on the number of times he or she committed certain infractions: hitting a side wall, failing to stop at a crosswalk, and crossing into an opposite lane. The first attempt on the set course was performed and graded without distractions. On the second attempt, the subject was asked a series of questions while completing the course.<br><br> Primary analysis showed that the average difference between Trial 1 and Trial 2 was 7.2 more mistakes. Further breakdown revealed that the average percent increase in mistakes due to the cognitive distraction was 85.626 percent. These numbers suggest that driving while engaging in any form of cognitive distraction, especially cell phone use, is potentially hazardous and should be outlawed for young drivers in all states.<br><br>

PICTURE THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER: THE POST TRAUMATIC EFFECTS OF CONCUSSION ON THE PROCESSING VISUAL STIUMLI. A THREE YEAR STUDY.
Johnathan Arnold Schoenhals
Miami High School, Miami OK, USA

Head trauma is among the most common childhood injures. It accounts for approximately 600,000 emergency department visits. There are estimated 300,000 sports related concussions that occur in high school contact sporty. A concussion by definition is a post traumatic impairment of neural status. The effects of a concussion are mostly experienced during the time in which the concussion has occurred, however, according to the National Neurological Center, the effects of a concussion can also become a problem later in life. There are many psychological tests used to determine if the brains cognitive process is working correctly. Among these test is the Stroop Effect, Stroop the compared the naming of colors for a list of solid squares with the naming of colors for a list of words printed in incongruent colors The purpose of this experiment is to pilot a test containing a Stroop effect which will challenge visual processing. This test will be used to determine if a traumatic brain injury, such as a concussion, has a positive or negative effect on visual processing. This test will measure the accuracy of visual perception in a timed period. This visual perception could then be correlated to visual processing speed. This would be beneficial in monitoring the recovery process from traumatic brain injuries. The results of this experiment show, with statistical support, that there is a significant difference in how concussion victims process visual information when compared to non concussion victims, with concussion victims showing a slower processing speed.<br><br><br><br><br>

THE HUMAN MIND AND MATHEMATICS: EXPLAINED THROUGH THE GOLDEN RATIO
Breanna Bounds Johnson
Southridge High School, Beaverton, Oregon

The purpose of this project is to determine whether or not the human mind works mathematically, specifically when performing visual tasks, and if the ability to think mathematically is innate or learned. To answer this question, high school subjects from a variety of different art, math, and psychology classes took part in a series of tests: the first being to draw a “perfect” rectangle; and the second being to circle the three most “beautiful” rectangles, when given an array of 10 with different ratios. To gather data to support the idea of innate mathematical vision, rather than learned, second graders will also be tested and asked to draw a “perfect” rectangle. The ratios of these rectangles drawn by the students, and those selected was then measured and compared to the Golden Ratio, which has been found to be the most “aesthetically pleasing” of ratios. The data collected from these tests provides an example that displays the degree to which the human mind can see beauty through mathematics—specifically the beauty of the Golden Ration—and therefore the degree to which it is programmed by mathematics. The current findings of the study support the idea that the human mind has an instinct to see and think mathematically—the ability is already with you at birth, it is not learned, however, further research is being conducted.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RATIONALITY: A STUDY OF IF AND WHY GENDERS DIFFER IN HOW CLOSELY THEY ADHERE TO THE THEORY OF RATIONAL BEHAVIOR.
Marshall Bradley Everett
Shoals Christian School, Florence Alabama, USA

The Theory of Rational Behavior states that when playing a game, a person (presumed to be rational) will choose the strategy that is best for him and the best response to the strategies of others. This theory is presumed to be useful because it allows economists to predict how people will respond to a given situation. The study of rational behavior lends itself to trying to understand how different groups of people behave strategically. The primary goal of this study is to understand if and why males and females differ in their rational behavior. This was accomplished through experiments with approximately 200 human subjects. The subjects were given two games to play: The Ultimatum Game (an economic game used to estimate the rationality of a participant) and The Risk Aversion Game (a game used to estimate the tendency of a participant to be risk averse). They were also given two questionnaires to complete: one asked basic questions (age, sex, ACT score), and the other was designed to estimate the concern for fairness the participant possessed. For each participant, the data from the questionnaires and the risk aversion game was compared to the data from The Ultimatum Game. The goal was to understand how age, sex, intelligence (ACT), risk aversion, and concern for fairness affected a participant’s strategy (rationality). The conclusions were that sex, age and risk aversion did not affect a participant’s rationality, but intelligence, actual risk taken, and concern for fairness greatly affected a participant's rationality. <br><br>

USE YOUR BRAIN TO LOSE YOUR PAIN
Sarah Beth Gillund
Wildrose Alamo Public School, Wildrose, North Dakota, United States

Do people have the ability to control and reduce pain simply by using positive thought exercises and relaxation techniques?<br><br>For this experiment, two mental exercises were designed to reduce pain using the methods of relaxation, imagery, and deep breathing, based on present research in related areas. A survey was also formulated containing a universal pain scale to measure how pain was impacted by the positive thought exercises. Subjects were selected that reported suffering from some sort of pain one or more times a week. The subjects completed the exercises and survey whenever pain occurred. <br><br>This study revealed that the human subjects had an 89% success rate reducing pain using the exercises. Eleven percent of the time the pain stayed the same, however, the pain never increased as a result of the exercises. 100% of the human subjects reported the exercises reduced pain at least once during the experimentation period. While Exercise A yielded a 6% percentage of unsuccessful trials, in Exercise B 20% of the trials were unsuccessful. Exercise A was approximately four times more successful than Exercise B.<br><br>In conclusion, the exercises demonstrated a plausible alternative to current pharmaceutical methods for reducing pain. This research exhibits very clearly that one has the ability to train their mind to have a major effect on pain. Further research may shed light on what kinds of pain can be managed best with this method.<br><br>

THE CAPACITY FOR EMPATHIZING AND SYSTEMIZING IN CHILDREN WITH WILLIAMS SYNDROME: IDENTIFYING A COGNITIVE PHENOTYPE
Milan Farrell Satcher
Valley Central High School, Montgomery, NY USA

The capacity for empathizing and systemizing was investigated in children with Williams Syndrome (WS) and typically developing (TD) controls, with all participants of a mental age between 6-11 years. The experiment tested the hypothesis that the cognitive phenotype of WS correlates with the extreme female brain, which is characterized by superior ability to empathize and inferior ability to systemize when compared to TD controls. Parents of the aforesaid populations completed the Cambridge Child Personality Questionnaire in reference to their child. Results showed that subjects with WS scored significantly lower on the systemizing questions (a= .05; p= .0049; t= -2.67) than TD controls, while no significant difference for scores on the empathizing questions was indicated between the groups. Despite this lack of statistical significance, a trend within the WS group revealed that each subject with WS mirrored the “individual” extreme female brain profile: a personally higher aptitude to empathize than systemize. This result, paired with the “typical” ability to empathize in children with WS, challenges previous conclusions that individuals with WS cannot understand second-order belief tasks. Although they test for empathy, second-order belief tasks are often presented to participants in a sequenced, or systematic format; however, as this study indicates, individuals with WS cannot understand such a format due to an incapacity for systemizing. This lack of processing encourages guessing on task questions, which implies lack of theory of mind, a key component of empathizing.

LISTENING WITH THE EYES: DOES SIGHT FOCUS AUDITORY LEARNING?
Zachary Scott Mace
Parkersburg High School, Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to explore the connection between vision and auditory learning. As stated in the form of the hypothesis: in a lecture/classroom setting in the presence of auditory stimuli only, the presence of a visual focal point, the speaker, would improve the retention of the auditory information. This was tested in a classroom setting by presenting two classes with auditory information and then administering a test to determine retention. One week after the test was first administered it was readministered in order to test long-term retention. Both sets of data were then compiled in a contingency table. A chi-squared distibution analysis was used to determine the significance and validity of the results in terms of the hypothesis. Because the analysis revoked the null hypothesis, the original hypothesis was supported. Thus, there appears to be a direct connection between sight and auditory learning.

DETERMINATION OF GENDER AND AGE BY THUMBPRINTS YEAR TWO
Meryl Adelman Hulteng, Shannon Marie Cassidy
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville Oregon, United States

This experiment was designed to test the ability to determine age and gender from a thumbprint. The science of fingerprinting is commonly used to identify individuals by comparing an unknown print to a known source. Thus far, no previous studies have been found involving age or gender determination of unknown prints. The hypothesis stated that thumbprint characteristics could be used to predict probable age and gender. <br><br> Year one of the study suggested that gender could be determined from a thumbprint using two characteristics: ridge count and type. During that initial investigation, questions arose as to whether or not age had an effect on thumbprints. The current study focuses on replicating the ability to determine gender and investigating the predictability of age using four characteristics: print type, ridge count, size, and density. <br><br> It was found that males and females differ significantly in print type, ridge count, and size. A classification system was created that allows gender to be predicted with 77.6% overall accuracy. Print size, and, under some circumstances, density were found to be modest predictors of age. A classification system for predicting age showed significant but modest improvements over chance.<br><br> If age and gender could be predicted from fingerprint characteristics, it could prove beneficial to criminal investigators and forensic analysts. This would allow the suspect pool to be narrowed even when no print is available for positive identification. Predictions of age and gender could also be used to prioritize database searches and print identification efforts. <br><br>

MUSIC TO MY EARS
Jordan Nicole Farris, Rachel Elizabeth Purtee
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro AR, United States of America

It has been reported that listening to music while taking a test or studying helps one to do better. This project is designed to see whether that idea is right or wrong. Thirty-nine local first graders were given a common math test. They were given two minutes to accurately complete as many problems as they could while having different genres of music being played in the background or a quiet background (no-music). Three types of musical genres were used. These were classical, country-western, and rock `n' roll.<br><br> The four individual tests were given on three separate occasions each separated by one week. Four out of five school days were used to conduct this experiment. For the results to be as accurate as possible, the same music was used on the same days. Also, the tests were given during the normal time the students had math class throughout the day. Six students who did not complete at least two tests under each of the experimental conditions were not included in the statistical analysis of the data. Paired t-tests were used to compare average test performances between the no-music condition and the three musical genres.<br><br> When the no-music scores were compared to the three musical genre scores, there was no significant difference in the scores. However, when the musical genres were compared only to each other, rock `n' roll math test scores were higher than country-western math test scores.

CULTURAL INFLUENCE ON EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO A SOCIAL TARGET IMAGE AS MEASURED BY A NOVEL EYE-TRACKING DEVICE
Cameron Walden Dennis, Suji Paek
West Salem High School, Salem, Oregon, United States of America

Culture acts like a pair of prescription glasses; a filter through which we see the world. And due to such significance, our hypothesis is that culture influences a subject's eye movement behavior while viewing a target image in a social context. <br><br> In order to track a subject's eye-movement behavior, we constructed an eye-tracking device consisting of a video camera in the night-vision setting using infrared light, a LCD computer screen, and a two-way mirror enclosed within a darkened wooden box. Computer software (Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop) was used to generate the target image from a digital photo and to analyze the video taken of the subject's eye movements. The subjects represented Japanese and Western cultures.<br><br> In the experiment, subjects looked through a lens-less goggle attached to the front of the box to center their eyes. The subjects viewed a picture of a man in a business suit in front of a natural landscape. This image, projected from the LCD computer screen, was reflected onto the two-way mirror. The subjects viewed the image while the Sony DCR-TRV18 Digital Handycam video camera in the infrared setting recorded their eye-movements from the other side of the mirror. <br><br> Video of each subject's eye movement was analyzed and compared based on the proportion of gaze fixation on a target image as compared to the background, gaze fixation duration, and eye movement patterns to determine if culture was a significant influence. Differences in proportions in gaze fixation between the cultures were found; thus, reinforcing our hypothesis. <br><br>

DOES GENDER AFFECT HANDWRITING ANALYSIS?
Angela Kristine Neslund, Jessica Gamber
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, Minnesota, United States

Titled “Does Gender Affect Handwriting Analysis?” this project focuses on just that. The idea was to identify whether gender has an effect on graphology’s accuracy (the hypothesis proposed that gender did not make a difference). Surveys were filled out, handwriting samples were written, and each survey was scored. The surveys were separated into four groups according to personality type, and this was used to check the accuracy of the handwriting analyses.Every sample was analyzed, and there was no difference between males and females. Seven T-tests proved seven trait comparisons to have scientifically relevant results. The conclusions drawn supported the hypothesis as close to fully as possible. <br><br>

Secondary school of clothing

Handicapped people belong among us. They deserve to be in a society in smart comfortable clothes which are easy to use. Whenever they are putting on in the morning, it is evident that not all garments meet their needs. <br><br>We were interested in the problems of handicapped people with their clothing. That is why we made a short survey. We asked these people what sorts of problems they had. We also asked what kinds of clothes they wore. By analyzing the questionnaires and interviews, we identified major problems including crew necks, getting dirty and rubbing long sleeves at the elbow area, wide sleeves at the bottom edges, jeans like unsuitable material, slash pockets at the trousers and layered pockets on the side seams and clothes closures with buttons and zips.<br><br>We tried to find a solution in order to eliminate or reduce these problems. We designed novel<br><br> “V” shape necks, dirtying sleeves from moving wheels of a wheelchair - covering these parts with a protective leather clothes, sleeves have to be classic straight, appropriate size or more narrow at the bottom parts, denim should be replaced with another material, for example material with elastic fibers. Appropriate kinds of closures are: riveted buttons, velcro zip, clips, hooks and eyes, lacing, buckles. <br><br>In the end we tested our suggestions in real situations. One of us meets such problems every day because she has a physically handicapped brother.<br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF SELF-ESTEEM IN THE LEARNING PROCESS
Alexandre Borges Alves Spindola, Lidiane Leal Andriolla
Fundação Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha

This project is about the influence of self-esteem in the learning process. The main objective is to verify if the self-esteem of a 10th grade student affects his learning revenue. The beliefs of self-esteem were measured (positive, average and negative) in relation to its own capacity of learning process and the “learning revenue” it was classified as high, medium or low, starting from the 10th grade students´s average scores during the school year.<br><br>The research was made with four teams of 10th grade students at Liberato Foundation. Each student received two questionnaires. One of them would find out informations about the student´s beliefs and even get information about his learning revenue. The other one would analyse the social-economic context of the student, to find out his intervinients variables. The project started in 05/20/2005 and finished in 11/04/2005.<br><br>The results were that the students with the high learning revenue have remarkable predominance of positive beliefs, reinforcing that they believe that they are able to learn. In the medium revenue group, the students believe that they have a medium capacity to learn. In the low learning revenue group the negative beliefs present the lowest rate, but comparing to the negative beliefs' rate of the others revenue groups it's much bigger.<br><br>The conclusion is that the self-esteem does affect the learning revenue, and that a tiny increase in the negative beliefs´s rate can have a big influence to the learning revenue.

COMPREHENSION ON THE COMPUTER: SEENIOR COMPUTER LATELY?
Jennifer Marie Pelton, Kyle Jurick, Rebecca Adams
Hicksville High School, Hicksville, Ohio, United States

It is hypothesized that senior citizens will be able to understand and use computers more easily with audio-visual aids to increase comprehension than when the same material is presented without aid. Due to lack of exposure and physical and mental handicaps, senior citizens often fail to comprehend use of computers. Thus, this project was designed to test the effects audio-visual aids had on teaching seniors computer skills. Twenty subjects over the age of 60 were enrolled in a twice weekly one hour computer class over a period of thirteen weeks. The first four weeks, subjects were taught computer skills without audio-visual aids. During the second four weeks, the same information was presented using a utility providing auditory assistance. A third, four-week control period followed to ensure the validity of the variable period. At the beginning and end of each period, subjects rated how often problems occurred and were tested in four skill areas: logging in, accessing a URL, performing an Internet search, and logging out.<br><br>Collected data supported the hypothesis; subjects improved both in their ability to perform tasks and in their knowledge and confidence of the material. Subjects improved in each of the skill areas, and survey responses showed improved knowledge. Yet, in the second control period, results increased by a statistically smaller interval, confirming that subjects’ improvement was indeed due to the audio-visual aids and not a longer period of learning. It was thus concluded that audio-visual aids helped seniors to better use computers.<br><br>

Because of the dissemination of educational softwares in schools the education has been suffering some transformations. However, it can not always provide an improvement in the quality of teaching. In the case that we studied the school tried to fit in a new tendency of computer introduction in pedagogic activities. Such enterprise happened through the attemption of create a programmed instruction software which would be put into practice with students.<br><br>The focus of our study was the case that happened in the school we study. There has been a project of construction, introduction, and application of softwares in professional educational courses in the model of Programmed Instruction. In such case the research was formed as a qualitative end quantitative study, inspired in the Study of Case methodology.<br><br>The research involved the comparison between groups that had used the softwares and groups that hadn’t access to the informatic area. At this moment of the work we made a quantitative research which put to use static models in the comparative analysis. It was also observed the process of construction and application of softwares. This observation corresponds to the qualitative analysis of the research.<br><br>At last, the dates indicate some surprises. Some purposes yearned by teachers are reached, however it doesn’t seem to take effect through the mechanisms that the educators consider to be correct. The process of learning is more efficient when the students elaborate questions and alternatives than repeating the lessons of the program. <br><br>

This descriptive-explicative and retro-prospective investigation emerges as a continuation of an exploratory investigation into resilience. It has the following objectives: <br><br>• To make the educational community feel interested in resilience as a source of self-help when we are faced with the adversities of our environment.<br><br>• To generate strategies to reduce the institutional risk factors.<br><br>• To provide information, activities and resources that will let us elaborate helpful resilience activities at school.<br><br>By means of methodological triangulation, applying as qualitative and quantitative techniques open interviews to professional educators, observing, and conducting structured diagnostic surveys of fixed multiple-choice questions to the teachers of the selected educational institution, we plan, design, implement and evaluate a school intervention project as a pilot test in a school located in a peripheral neighborhood of Paraná (Entre Ríos-AR), whose students present a high rate of risk factors.<br><br> Psychologically advised and supported by the staff of different departments of the State Board of Education, we develop and implement the project called “We change to change” , based upon two approaches: the tetra model and the resilience wheel. The project consists of three stages; first intervention: mitigate the risks; second intervention: build up resilience; and evaluation.<br><br>As regards the reduction of the risk factors, the results were satisfactory. It is necessary to make adjustments so as to improve them and achieve a truly resilient school.<br><br>We propose the implementation of this project in other schools with a high rate of risk factors.<br><br>

TEEN OBESITY- IS PORTION SIZE PERCEPTION THE PROBLEM
Samantha Grace Hennenfent, Austin Malach
Fort Zumwalt West High School, O'Fallon, Missouri, United States of America

The purpose was to determine if there is a correlation between BMI, family eating habits and portion size perception and to examine the relationship between the size of the container a single portion is served in and the subject’s satiation. Twenty female high school student’s height and weight were taken to calculate BMI. Subjects were asked to pour one portion of cereal in a 250ml cereal bowl. The portion was bagged and weighed. Subjects took a family eating habits survey. Surveys were scored and compared to BMI and portion size perception. Subjects ate a pre-measured single portion of candy placed either in a 50 ml cup or a 250 ml bowl. There satiation level was then surveyed. When comparing family eating habits to portion size, the null hypothesis was rejected. There is a correlation (r=-0.225) between a family’s eating habits and a teenage girl’s perception of portion size. When comparing BMI to portion size perception, the null hypothesis was accepted, indicating no correlation (r=0.001). Most subjects were within the normal range of BMI and typically underestimated the portion of cereal. There was no correlation (r=0.114) between a teenage girl’s BMI and her family’s eating habits. Even though the mean family eating habits score of 9.2 indicates that the families need to work on their health habits, the teenage girls in this study were either athletes or actresses and are very conscious of their weight and tend to self-monitor their diets.

During the past recent years school violence has been flooding the major headline news. Due to the social implications of such events, special attention has been given in order to understand the causes and risk factors of violence in school settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the potential causal factors of school violence among students from public and private sectors. The population sample consisted of two hundred young people from high school of eleventh and twelfth grade of both academic sectors.<br><br> A questionnaire with thirty different questions related to the potential factors causes of school violence was used as the research instrument. The answers were obtained by means of an evaluative scale from one to four. <br><br> The data analysis was carried out using a spreadsheet of the program MS Excel. The results were tabulated by school to determine if the sample of each sector responded in the same way. This was obtained using a variance analysis (ANOVA). Finally, another ANOVA was used to establish if there was a difference in the perception on the causes of school violence between high school students from both academic sectors.<br><br> The results of this study concluded that no significant difference was found in the perception on the causes of school violence between students of both academic sectors. Further studies should continue with other geographical groups and population to support and widen people’s perception about the underlying causes of school violence.<br><br>

DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOR OF LAKE APOPKA AREA CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WERE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES
Grant Fabian Chernoby, Shahin Pourkaviani
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States of America

The problem investigated whether toxins internally or externally consumed by parents affect the physical and mental development of their children. The alternative hypothesis stated that there is a statistically significant difference in children’s’ mental and physical capabilities in children whose parents had exposure to pesticides through farming on Lake Apopka compared to children whose parents did not have this exposure. The null hypothesis stated that there would not be a statistically significant difference in physical and mental development between children whose parents were exposed to a high level of toxins from Lake Apopka compared to the children whose parents were not exposed to a high level of toxins from Lake Apopka. To investigate the problem, the researchers conducted simple tests on each child. The children were then split into three main groups where they were then compared to the control group. <br><br> The results showed statistically significant evidence that the children whose parents were exposed to a high level of toxins scored significantly less than the control group. It was concluded that the children whose parents had internal and external exposure to pesticides were at least one year behind in mental and physical capabilities. The data was analyzed by using the two sample t-test to prove significance.<br><br>

THE FAMILIALITY OF AUTISTIC TRAITS IN FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASD)
Nathalie Fay Tadena, Alene Georgia Anello
Ossining HS, Ossining, NY, USA; Sleepy Hollow HS, Tarrytown, NY, USA

Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, characterized by repetitive patterns of behavior and impaired social, communicative and emotional processing skills. Studies suggest a relationship between parental age and autism, a genetic basis to autism, and a greater risk of social deficits in relatives of individuals with autism. We analyzed the effect of parental age on symptom severity and sex in 586 individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using data that was collected previously by a research institution. Advancing maternal age appeared associated with decreased severity in social deficits (r=.10, p=.019) and repetitive behaviors (r= -.19, p<.001) in individuals with ASD. Advancing paternal age was associated with fewer repetitive behaviors (r= -.09, p = .028) and higher incidence of females in these individuals (p= .03). Additionally, the relationship between the social skills of 113 parents of children with autism and the social skills of their children was examined, using data from the Personality Questionnaire and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, previously collected by a research institution. We administered the Personality Questionnaire and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale to a control group of 34 parents with no family history of autism. No relationship appeared between the social skills of parents and the severity of social deficits in their children with autism (r=.033, p= .736). Siblings of children with autism appeared to have less developed social skills than siblings of unaffected individuals (p=.04). Brothers of children with autism appeared to have less developed social skills than sisters (p<.001).<br><br>

We have decided to undertake the task of surveying the biology teachers of randomly chosen schools across the country to see exactly how biology, specifically evolution, or its counterpart, creationism, is taught in the United States. Additionally, we wanted to examine how the intelligent design theory is being received as a compromise between creationism and evolution. The goal of our project is to trace the roots of the controversy to its sectional, political, or even personal origins. We wanted to see what teachers are teaching in the classrooms and their opinions on their specific curriculum. 430 hard copies of the survey were mailed to the high schools’ biology teachers and 113 responses were received in total. The data were analyzed using Stata SE8.2 for statistical significance. From our results, we found that intelligent design is not as popular as we expected; however, many people still believe that God and evolution could be compatible. There is a schism in the opinions of biology teachers when divided by their location, political beliefs, and their states’ recent history of legislative controversy. The significant findings in all three groups indicate that the country is very polarized on this issue.

MANIPULATION BEHIND THE SCENES

Shepton High School, Plano, Texas, USA

Some people think that subliminal images can influence the viewer’s perception of certain subjects. This is believed to be done by using subliminal images in advertising or propaganda, but these are only some examples as to how these images are thought be used. So, the purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not subliminal images truly have any effect on the viewer. In order to do this, PowerPoints containing subliminal images were created, and a questionnaire that was used to verify the validity of the effect of subliminal images on the viewers was created. Then, a group of people was gathered for testing. Each person watched one of the three PowerPoints, then answered the questionnaire. This procedure was done three times, once a week, and each time the test subject watched one PowerPoint and answered the questionnaire. After the questionnaires had been examined, it was apparent the images had a marked effect on the viewers. About 33% of the decisions made, were influenced by the subliminal images, while the control group, who were shown one of the exact same PowerPoints without the subliminal images, did not make the intended decisions that had been predetermined by the authors. Based on this, it was apparent that subliminal images truly impact and influence the viewer. So, subliminal images were proven to affect the viewer’s decision-making process.

In the project, “Reading, Rote, and Russian,” the researchers attempted to see whether high-school students would learn a second language better through a phonetics approach, in which subjects learn the pronunciation of that language’s letters before they learn words, or through a look-say approach, in which subjects are not taught the pronunciation of the letters. The researchers tested this hypothesis by teaching the students twenty words over a period of three days and by administering a thirty-point standardized test on the fourth day. One researcher taught the words and administered the test; the other analyzed the data. There were just over 100 students. Half were taught using a phonetics approach and half were taught using a look-say approach. Overall, there was no significant difference between the scores of students that were taught using a look-say approach and students that were taught using a phonetics approach.

WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IQ AND HEMISPHERICAL BRAIN DOMINANCE?
Shanna Erin Wilson, Brett Mayer, Jillayne Pfeifle
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, South Dakota, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if there is a correlation between hemispherical brain dominance and intelligence quotients (IQ). The hypothesis was that there would be no correlation between either left hemispherical dominant people, right hemispherical dominant people and their specific IQ. Procedures used to conduct this experiment were three tests that determine hemispherical brain dominance and two intelligence quotients tests. In the experiment there were 15 males and 15 females for a total of 30 subjects all ranging between the ages of 16 and 18.<br><br>Knowing that each side of the brain has its own unique and special abilities, such as the right hemisphere being intuitive and the left hemisphere being logical, could increase student academic performance immensely. Obtaining the knowledge of one's hemispherical dominance may also aid in the work field. Each person could recognize the weaknesses and strengths he or she possesses due to the specific studies conducted and the characteristics of his or her dominant hemisphere.<br><br>The results of this experiment indicated that there is no relationship between intelligence quotients and hemispherical brain dominance. In the tests that were conducted, there was essentially no difference in IQ between right and left hemispherical dominant subjects. Research also concluded that intelligence does not depend on gender. Data supported no correlation between gender and hemispherical dominance.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF CNS STIMULANTS AND SSRIS ON THE FORMATION OF CONDITIONED LONG TERM MEMORY AND LEARNING BEHAVIORS IN SLEEP DEPRIVED WILDTYPE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Mary Martha Ferrari Douglas, Alison W. Liu
Manhasset High School, Manhasset New York, USA

63% of the college students suffer from a lack of sleep. 15% are clinically depressed and nearly half of these students take antidepressants. Walker suggests that adequate sleep is crucial for effective learning and long term memory (LTM). Caffeine, a commonly used stimulant, is believed to facilitate memory by raising concentrations of memory effector proteins. SSRIs such as Prozac (fluoxetine) allow a buildup of serotonin by blocking its reuptake. Therefore the purpose of this experiment was to document the effects of sleep deprivation on LTM in wildtype Drosophila and establish the effects of caffeine and fluoxetine on LTM formation. This study hypothesized that fully rested drosophila would perform better on LTM testing than sleep deprived ones. Additionally, it stated that supplementation of fluoxetine and caffeine would foster LTM formation. Flies were divided into ten subdivisions; normal sleep (control), drug supplemented, sleep deprived and supplemented sleep deprived. Two concentrations each of caffeine and fluoxetine were used. Drosophila were olfactory trained with 3-Octanol using the interval training method of Tully, shown to be effective at creating LTM. One week post training, drosophila were tested for LTM. More than 4,000 flies were tested. After 4-6 trials of each subdivision, sleep deprivation was shown to hinder LTM (ANOVA p<.05). Supplmentation of caffeine and fluoxetine did not create a significant difference when supplemented without sleep deprivation. However, supplementation prior to sleep deprivation was shown to actually reverse the effects of sleep deprivation on LTM.<br><br>

VIDEO GAMES AND YOUR HEALTH
Helen Terri Ly, Wellis Leung
Josiah Quincy Upper School, Boston, MA, USA

It is common to hear parents say this, “Stop playing video games, it’s going to hurt you more than you think.” That might be true, but that sort of statement is pretty bold without any evidence supporting it.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to either find evidence to support the above statement or to prove it wrong. The experiment tested 37 subjects between the ages of 14 to 18. The subjects played non-violent video games for the duration of thirty minutes. Their blood pressure, vision and reaction time were measured before and after the game playing.<br><br> To test the blood pressure, we used a blood pressure monitor to keep track of the subject’s blood pressure for 30 minutes with two 15 minutes interval. The vision test was taken only twice to see the difference. Two different hand written tests were given to the subjects before and after the experiment to test their reaction speed.<br><br> Our hypothesis was that video games would cause the subjects’ eyes to become worse, blood pressure would be very high after the video game, and their reaction time would be slow. Our results refuted our hypothesis. Instead of high blood pressure and blurred vision, the subjects had lower blood pressure and better eyesight. The reaction time did increase. We concluded that video games do not completely have a negative effect on everyone.<br><br>

PRECONCEIVED STEREOTYPES IN SCHOOL CHILDREN
Meghan Sophia Luther, Veronika Biskis
H.P. Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, United States

The purpose of this project was to discover if stereotypes have been formed in the minds of children as young as second grade. We hoped to determine the age at which they are most vulnerable to the influences of society. Having acquired this information, we can then be able to control their surroundings and keep them at a stage of innocence until they may form their own opinions. Our hypothesis states that children as young as second grade will already have been exposed to common racial and gender stereotypes. <br><br>After a month of research we discovered that children had formed stereotypes in the areas involving power, athletic ability, crime, possessions, intelligence, personality, social status, and marital status. Stereotypes that had not been formed in the minds of children included money, and where you live. <br><br>After examining our results we concluded that our hypothesis was correct in that society has already swayed the views of children as young as second grade. Through the research we hope to reach out to anybody in contact with a child to protect them from prejudice at this crucial time in their development. <br><br>

FALSE MEMORIES ABSTRACT
Joseph Pak Noh, Styles Smith
Glencoe High School, Hillsboro OR, United States of America

This experiment attempts to answer the question "If a child of ten to twelve years old of age were read a list of similar words to an objective word, would that cause the mind to saying the objective word although it was not on the list?" <br><br> The hypothesis is that if a child is read a list of words that were similar to another word but wasn¡¯t on the list, the child would still say that objective word due to the similarities of the words and cause them to think the experimenters actually said it.<br><br> The experimental procedure involved going to a neighborhood elementary school and reciting the words to a class of 6th and 5th graders individually. Then we had them think about the words for thirty seconds and then recite them back.<br><br> The results of the experiment confirmed our hypothesis and showed that if a child were read a list of words similar to another but wasn¡¯t listed, that child would still recite that word when asked to recite what they could remember. The experiment showed a forty percent success rating. <br><br>

DRIVING PLUS CELL PHONES EQUALS NO CONCENTRATION
Frances May Bruce, Jing Chen
Mayo High School, Rochester MN, USA

More and more people including teenagers talk on cell phones while they are doing something else that actually requires full attention. However, people may not realize the impact cell phone conversation has on their ability to focus. Our project tested the effect on concentration while talking on a cell phone and driving, and determined whether youth and adults were equally affected. Sixteen adults and twenty youth were selected to perform a simulated computer car-racing game with and without using a cell phone. The order of testing was randomized so that a learning curve would not occur. The time each subject required to finish the racing course and the number of crashes were recorded. Our data showed that cell phone usage significantly increased (p<0.05) the number of car accidents in adults. Interestingly, youth were not affected as much as adults, presumably due to their familiarity with computer games. To test this possibility, we conducted a second experiment to test the subject’s ability to complete randomly selected basic multiplication problems under two minutes with and without use of a cell phone. Both the adults and the youth showed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the number of multiplication problems done and percentage of accuracy with cell phone usage. In both cases, cell phone usage significantly (p<0.05) increased the subject’s stress level. The results of our project demonstrate that cell phone usage impairs concentration regardless of age and cell phone usage while driving is dangerous.

Due to the high rate of failure to university admission, in 2005 the group decided to investigate about the difficulties that cause such failure.<br><br>We carried on the investigation in our hometown, Tandil, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where we have a prestigious National University, “UNCPBA”.<br><br>Aim:<br><br>“Analyze the opinion of Third Year Polimodal Students (former year to university), teachers, professors and educational authorities on the causes that bring about the failure to the admission to university in the city of Tandil”.<br><br>To carry out this research, the group conducted surveys to Third Year Polimodal students, professors and teachers of all different levels, and interviews to educational authorities. <br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>• The students see themselves as having no difficulties, in contrast to the professors and teachers perception who consider that students do have many difficulties.<br><br>• These two different perceptions about the educational preparation of Polimodal Students would show that the provision of shelter is more important than the pedagogical one. This fact would affect the quality of learning.<br><br>• As regards the responsibilities of the poor education of the students who attempt to be admitted at university, it was observed that teachers and professors are less strict when they evaluate their own educational level than when they evaluate the previous and the subsequent ones. Nevertheless, according to the educational authorities interviewed, the problem has to be analyzed from a systemic perspective where each level is co responsible.<br><br>These results give us many clues so as to continue investigating.

Escuela Nro. 362, Coranzull, Jujuy, ARGENTINA

This research work started after a student school trip belonging to a school located in the plateau region of Jujuy. The idea was to make a survey related to its landscape. During the trip, the children discovered that the "antigales" were really damaged, and this worried them a lot. This gave rise to the research related to who were the "old people" (antiguos), the importance they had for the community and who has responsible for its maintenance.<br><br> The result of the work shows that the community is aware of its acestral roots that tie them to the "antigales" although they don't know which laws are related to the protection of the archeological sites. But they also know that these places of the community, not leaving aside the respect they must have for a cultural heritage.<br><br> The project's goal is to get students and through them the local community to the knowledge of our ancestors and how this heritage has come to them, which nowadays is in danger of disappearing.<br><br>Key words: Antigales - plateau of Jujuy - heritage - ancestral roots.

The project "Chicha Culture: Between Respect and Forgetfulness allowed us to discover a historical place, which is a very important source of knowledge and wisdom of our ancestors, an archeological site located near our school, Cerro Colorado and Laguna Colorada, Department of Yavi - Jujuy - Argentina.<br><br> That place is called by the inhabitants as "forbidden because of respect and fear". This labeling led to forgetfulness, nobody took care of the place, and there were many acts of pillage, thus the place became unknown for the most of the people.<br><br> From then, a research work started so as to give value again to the chicha culture. Students' motivation started with a questioning process looking for information on the origin, culture and historical time of the indigenous people.<br><br> During the research process the first important information came from several sources with the help of the community. Then a process of awareness started, so as to help the people to face their vital environment, taking part in it, breaking a daily position of knowledge of their reality and trying to get this to be a challenge in order to humanize and change their culture, without leaving aside the legal regulations regarding protection to a cultural and archeological heritage.<br><br> While educating we try to show that this culture is alive and that it survives through people's rites, customs and traditions that need a stricter process so as to know it, protect it, know its value and thus build an authentic identity.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF GENDER ON PHYSICIANS' AND PHARMACISTS' ATTITUDES TOWARD PAIN AND THE USE OF NARCOTIC ANALGESICS
Mark H. McKenzie
Eastside High School, Gainesville, Florida, USA

There are no studies in the medical literature that examine gender of physicians and pharmacists related to opiophobic attitudes (fear of using narcotics) to treat pain. The purpose of this project was to determine if the gender of 200 physicians and 403 pharmacists in Florida affected the degree of opiophobia as demonstrated in a survey to assess attitudes toward pain and the use of narcotic analgesics. <br><br> The survey instrument consisted of 37 statements that assessed attitudes in four categories: knowledge of pain/treatment, fear of patient addiction to narcotics, apprehension of drug regulatory agencies, and reluctance to prescribe/recommend narcotics for pain. Respondents indicated strongly agree to strongly disagree across a seven-point Likert scale. <br><br> Results indicated a high degree of opiophobia with statistically significant differences between physicians’ and pharmacists’ attitudes in the above categories except knowledge of pain. A correct response was designated for each of the 37 statements. Correct, incorrect, and neither agree/disagree responses were given scores of 1, -1, and 0, respectively. The scores were summed within each of the four categories of the survey. The category means were analyzed using analysis of variance for gender alone and gender interaction by physician and pharmacist groups. The analysis revealed that gender was not a statistically significant factor. <br><br> Therefore, the gender of physicians and pharmacists does not influence their opiophobic attitudes toward patients with pain. Patients are at high risk for inadequate pain management with narcotics whether they receive care from male or female physicians or pharmacists.<br><br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN TWO COMPUTER PLATFORMS AND THE PAPER/PENCIL VERSION WHEN USED BY NURSING STUDENTS TO DOCUMENT PATIENT RECORDS
Brian Michael Rollman
SESO,Mayaguez, PR

Nurses must spend a considerable amount of time documenting the care they give to their patients. Failure to do so may result in the reduction of quality in patient care. Studies have shown that computers allow healthcare workers to improve communication processes. Yet most of the literature used for these studies is descriptive writing rather than comparative writing. This research investigated`` if there is any significant difference between the charting time, number of errors and number of tasks completed by nursing students when charting in two electronic platforms (laptop and Tablet pc) vs. the paper –based one. Fifteen 3rd and 4th year nursing students were provided with a 15 and 8 minute tutorial sessions and practice time on the 3 documentation platforms. Later students were required to perform 8 charting tasks in each one of the platforms. Students were also required to complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the testing activities. Analysis of variance at a .05 alpha level showed that there was enough evidence to: a) accept that there is a significant difference in the overall time nursing students took to do their documentation(F = 6.84) and b) in their preference over the 3 platforms under investigation (F = 4.71). No significant variances were found for the number of errors (F = .014) and completion of tasks (F = .098). Findings from this study suggest that electronic documentation applications provide nursing students with a time saving tool to implement documentation. Nursing programs nationwide must consider enhancing nursing education by introducing electronic platforms within the content of their courses. Such changes will help train nurses to be able to improve the quality of patient care and help to contain the cost of health care services in the future<br><br>

ANIMAL CARING - AN EDUCATIONAL PROPOSAL II
Anelise dos Santos Klein
Fundacao Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha - Novo Hamburgo - RS - Brasil

In order to create an active Animal Caring Association several aspects must be observed mainly the local community's effective participation to stimulate the interest in a society where it doesn’t generally note a familiar, educational or governmental participation.<br><br>From this observation, there was formulated a method of playful and informative teaching that stimulates the children to have a good relationship with the domestic animals. In parallel, an information CD-ROM was created with the project and its methodology for to application in local schools.<br><br>So a new question was formulated: is it possible to implement and to test the applicability of this method in school environment?<br><br>Then, workshops of study were carried out with engaged teachers, in way to enable them the application of the method among their students. <br><br>Like the form of the approximation between project and teacher, a site was created with relevant contents and making possible contact with the investigator. After the application, it was executed a quantitative, subjective study about the use of the method by the school community, comparatively with the results obtained in the preliminary application.<br><br>The project was developed through a descriptive inquiry of field and the report made inside the specific standards. The data were obtained through teachers’ reports.<br><br>With the conclusion of this stage, it was observed to be possible to insert in the school environment contents that, from the childhood, wake in the human being a feeling of care with the animals and the interdependence between the elements of the nature.<br><br>

In this project I developed two new prototypes of vision aids to help the visually impaired, use their remaining vision in a more effective way. I also present a planning for the insertion of the Vision Aid in the market. <br><br>According to the world health organization from 70 to 80% of the people considerate as blind are not really blind and their remaining vision are not being used. That happens mostly because people don’t know of the existence of vision aids, perhaps because those devices are very expensive and are of difficult adaptation.<br><br>The objective of this project is to provide social insertion trough constructing and providing low-cost vision aids to visually impaired people that can’t afford the ones that exist on the market, making the vision aid accessible for a large number of people. <br><br>I projected and constructed a innovator ring-monocular based on the principles of the Galileo telescope, which allows the monocular to be constructed based on the needs of each person. I also constructed an ergonomic support with a magnifying lens attached on it, so the person can read and write whit out having to bend its back and having to hold a magnifying lens, which was a very uncomfortable position that is now solved. The prototypes were tested and proved to be efficient and low cost being able to introduce in the society and help a huge number of people increasing their quality of life, self-esteem and giving them accessibility to the work market and education.<br><br>

SHORT-TERM AND WORKING MEMORY IN CHILDREN: A COMPARISON OF VISUAL SEQUENCES AND PATTERN RECALL
Jessica Caroline Stanton
Columbia High School, Lake City Florida, United States of America

This project is assessing short-term and working memory in children. Four different tests were used: Picture pattern and picture sequence tests, a Corsi Block Test, a Digit Span Test, and the Visual Patterns Test (Feltham, Suolk: Thames Valley Test Company, 1997). The first two questions tested short-term memory, while the other three tested working memory. Five different questions were asked: is pictorial recall better when presentation is in patterns or sequences, does age have an effect on this picture to sequence ratio, does age have an effect on the VPT score, does age have an effect on the ratio of Corsi to Digit test scores, and does age have an effect on the ratio of Corsi to VPT scores? Participants amounted to 67 total, ages 5 to 18. Each was given either version A or version B of each test, and every student received the same information before and after each test. Total testing time equaled fifteen minutes per student. My results showed statistical data to accept the following: pictorial presentations are equal in effect, this ratio is equal among age groups, age does affect the VPT score, age affects the Corsi to Digit ratio, and age affects the Corsi to VPT ratio. Full analysis of the data suggests that students are affected by pattern presentation (based on VPT scores), when assessing working memory. It also suggests that we are underutilizing our teaching resources for presentation though out the age groups. This data is also applicable for further scientific study.

THE EFFECTS OF CONSUMING SNACK FOODS ON READING COMPREHENSION
John William O'Shea
Bagley High School; Bagley, Minnesota USA

My experiment was designed to test if eating while reading helps improve reading comprehension. I tested 8th grade students in a classroom setting. The first day (control) the students read and tested on a reading selection. The following ten days students were provided with a variety of snacks while they read the stories and completed the accompanying tests.<br><br> I thought this experiment would exhibit that some foods should show improved reading comprehension while reading - these are licorice, fruit snacks, and Slim Jims. I believed these foods would show positive results because they are chewy, as studies present that chewing or sucking while reading show increased levels of concentration.<br><br> The average percentage on the control day was 56.12%. My results showed that on Days 2, 6, and 9 the students scored the highest overall percentages. Day 2 had a score of 76.2% (licorice), Day 6 was 83.52% (Slim Jims), and Day 9 had 81.58% (pretzels). The days with the lowest overall percentages were Day 7 with 56.14% (trail mix) and Day 10 (Goldfish crackers) with 61.25%.<br><br> All days after the control day presented nearly the same, and in most cases higher percentages. I completed a rank-sum statistical test to determine if the mean scores for each set of tests (control and experimental) were significant. The z value on the rank-sum test fell within the acceptable range, and therefore I concluded that consuming snack foods can have a positive effect on reading comprehension. <br><br>

THE EYE-WITNESSING PROJECT: HOW IS AN INDIVIDUAL'S BLOOD PRESSURE EFFECTED AFTER EXPOSURE TO A CRIME SCENE?
Shyam Janak Desai
Celebration High School, Celebration, Florida, USA

The problem that was experimented upon is how is an individual's blood pressure effected after exposure to a crime scene? It was hypothesized that blood pressure will dramatically increase post exposure to the video of the crime scene. Students would be in an environment of stress and anxiety. It is believed that females will perform much better on the survey than males because they are prone to being more focused and observant. However, they will have higher blood pressure than the males because they are not used to the rigorous and stressful environment.<br><br>To perform this project a column of mercury is linked to an inflatable cuff, which is wrapped around the upper arm. A stethoscope is then used to listen to the sounds of the blood in the brachial artery, at the bend of the elbow. The first set of blood pressure will be taken 30 minutes prior to the viewing of the video clip to make sure when comparing results there are no variables. Individuals will be shown the 3 minute and 32 second video clip of the crime scene. Blood pressure will be taken again. Finally, Surveys will be distributed and individuals will fill out information. The survey will ask questions very similar to a detective seeking information about the criminal. Blood pressure will be taken again immediately after survey is completed, and then again 30 minutes after the video exposure. <br><br>This project is critical to understanding an individual's accuracy on a crime scene report in a state of stress versus a state of normality. The hypothesis was proven incorrect. Girls were shown to be less precise on their answers, which could be impacted by their increase in blood pressure. The males had a stable blood pressure and answers closer to what was correct.

SENSORY INTEGRATION & AUTISM
Lawanya Jeyaselvan
Celebration High School, Celebration, Florida, USA

The Purpose of this project is to see which type of sensory activity will better help children with autism. The Hypothesis is that jumping on a trampoline will better help the child concentrate on the task at hand versus swinging on a swing and sitting on a core disc. During this experiment ten children diagnosed with autism were asked to join in this study. The experiment was completed by having a certified teacher lead the children in completing three activities, a simple shape puzzle, a five piece Peg-board and stringing five beads on to a shoe lace. Each child was timed during the first trial, which followed no vestibular sensory activity session. After each child completed all three activities they were put through the three vestibular activities, jumping on a trampoline, sitting on a core disc, and swinging on a swing each for ten minutes. Following the trampoline session was stringing five beads on a show lace, while sitting on a core disc the child would complete the simple shape puzzle and finally, after swinging they would then complete the five piece pegboard. After the scientist completed the experiment she observed that after the vestibular sensory sessions the children were better able to concentrate and could complete the task at a faster pace. When the children first had to complete each activity most of them had many stems that them back from completing the activity at an appropriate pace however after the sensory session this was no longer a setback for the children. In conclusion, the scientist's hypothesis was correct; jumping on a trampoline helped the autistic children complete the task more efficiently

EFFECTS OF CONTEXT ON INTERIOR SCRAMBLED TEXT
Stefan Joshua Coburn
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, Georgia USA

The purpose of this experiment is to identify what effect context has on interior scrambled text recognition. The hypothesis presented for experimentation was a null hypothesis, that context had no effect upon recognition. Twenty-five participants were given two sets of 24 stimuli to distinguish as either interior scrambled word or nonword in a lexical decision experiment. In one set the twenty four stimuli were each presented in isolation, and in the other set the stimuli were each presented in the context of a sentence, which was completely interiorly scrambled. Each stimulus was shown via PowerPoint on a slide for 4 seconds. To keep some control over the stimuli, each interior scrambled word was drawn from a list of the 500 most common sight words to ensure consistent familiarity. In the context condition the stimuli that had to be identified was always the last word. Each participant was randomly assigned to the isolation set or context set first and the other second. For each participant the difference in correctly identified stimuli was taken and an average difference was calculated. The mean difference was 3.88 stimuli. Using a single-tailed T-test a p of 5.34X10^-10 was obtained. This statistical analysis indicates that the data refutes the null hypothesis. This means the null hypothesis can be reasonably rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that context aids word recognition. In addition, the data contests the idea that the ability to read interior scrambled text implies that people read words independent of letter order.

SIX SIGMA AND THE CHANGE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORS: THE CREATION OF SIX SIGMA BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION PROCEDURE (SIX SIGMA BMP)
Will Xu
Winona Senior High School, Winona MN, United States of America

After the attacks of 9/11, the amount of money contributed to a charity organization for local use declined. However, the declining trend persisted year after year, resulting in cuts to local charity services. This study aimed to stop the steady decline in the amount of money a local charity organization received from its fund-raising campaigns by changing the behaviors of contributors. Six Sigma BMP, a new Six Sigma procedure based on the DMADV model, was created to design efficient fund-raising processes. The model followed five steps: define, measure, analyze, design, and verify. Two hypotheses were tested at a regional private university, which were that fund-raising campaign using Six Sigma BMP would receive a larger number of contributions and that fund-raising campaign using Six Sigma BMP would receive more money per contribution. Results showed that while it may not increase the number of contributions, Six Sigma BMP would increase the amount of money received per contribution. It is concluded that Six Sigma BMP can be used to modify human behavior and create efficient fund-raising processes. Limitations exist and further testing is needed.

SIMULATED AVIATION PERFORMANCE EFFECTS OF AN ENGINEERED ENVIRONMENT
Louis Walter Buckalew, IV
Davidson High School, Mobile, Alabama, United States of America

Today's military aircraft cockpits are increasingly complex, as advanced weapons systems and technology are added creating greater demands on pilots. To "fight and win," pilots must be given every 'edge' possible. Military, medical, and commercial research has explored possibly relevant effects of negative ions on health, physical, cognitive, and emotional variables with mixed results. This study was to determine is a negative ion environment improved, as hypothesized, performance related to aviation combat. As paid volunteers, 16 male high school students served as subjects. Primary equipment included a PC, CRT monitor, and Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator software integrated as a control station and negative ion generator, joystick, sound chair, and plat panel dispay organized in a plywood 'cockpit.' Before testing, subjects completed an informed consent form and gaming experience questionnaire and received a mission briefing, joystick training, and practice trial. Each subject had 2 trials in ion-charged and 2 in 'normal' environments, with a break between trial blocks to change conditions. Trial scenarios were identical, and half the subjects started under normal and half under ion conditions. Measures of simulated combat performance included mission time, firing accuracy, bombers 'killed,' and efficiency. Results suggested conclusions that, while mission time was less in normal conditions and accuracy was no different, ion conditions showed better performance for bomber 'kills' and overall efficiency (primary mission goals). While findings are encouraging in supporting pilot performance, future study should increase subject and task sample sizes and time to allow 'acclimation' before testing in the ion condition.

DIFFERENTIATING EARLY-ONSET BIPOLAR DISORDER FROM ADHD, A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Zachary Adam Rubin
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, U.S.A.

Childhood bipolar disorder is one of the most disabling forms of mental illness and a major challenge has been to differentiate children with early-onset bipolar disorder from those with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this two-year study was to differentiate symptoms of early-onset bipolar disorder, symptoms of ADHD, and behaviors of normal childhood and adolescence so that children can be properly diagnosed and appropriately treated for bipolar disorder. The first year of experimentation determined symptoms that are associated with early-onset bipolar disorder. Using these results, the second year of this experiment sought to differentiate symptoms of early-onset bipolar disorder from symptoms of ADHD and from behaviors of normal childhood and adolescence. I hypothesized that there would be a statistically significant difference between the Bipolar group and the ADHD group as well as the Bipolar Group and the Control group for positive bipolar disorder symptomatology. A questionnaire containing 27 questions concerning prominent symptoms of bipolar disorder revealed by the first part of this research was used. The questionnaire and informed consent form were given to 15 teenagers diagnosed with ADHD and to a control group of 15 teenagers without this diagnosis. Neither group had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Statistical analysis supported the hypothesis and revealed that 19 of the bipolar symptoms used for this experiment were not typically found in those with and without ADHD. This focused group of symptoms would be useful in differentiating children with bipolar disorder from children with ADHD and those with typical child and adolescent behaviors.

THE EFFECTS OF CAPSAICIN ON DROSOPHILA
Ann Simone Cooper
Lafayette Senior High School, Lexington, KY, USA

Capsaicin, the active ingredient in red peppers, might serve as a natural repellent or insecticide. A genetically engineered strand of Drosophila was used that contains 3 inserted genes which codes for the TRVP receptor (i.e. the capsaicin receptor). The expression was targeted specifically for sensory neurons. The sensitivity to capsaicin was compared in background strains to the over expresser strain in both larvae and adults. The flies were examined with 4 different experimental paradigms: (1) adult taste, (2) larval taste, (3) egg laying, and (4) adult smell. Capsaicin was exposed to the flies in its pure form mixed with cornmeal to compare with ground up red pepper mixed with cornmeal. From these experiments I proved that my hypothesis was not supported in that red pepper and pure capsaicin did not serve as a natural repellent, but it did act as a insecticide for larvae but not adults in control stains of flies. However, the adults and larvae in the over expresser strain are very sensitive to capsaicin. This study relates to the potential use of red pepper as means to control insects from growing in exposed foods prior to the use of refrigeration in old civilizations (i.e., Koreans and their traditional kimchi dishes). This study may also help one to understand the range of sensitivities to capsaicin in humans and other animals by varied expression levels of the receptors to capsaicin.

A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS: THE PERSONAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IN A SECONDARY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT
Eric Russell Stipe
West Salem High School, Salem, Oregon, USA

In any given place--be it a school, an office building, even a community--a social network is present. These social networks provide an interesting insight into the connections and interactions that are being made within a system. The purpose of my research and experimentation is to construct a Social Network Analysis within the confines of West Salem High School. I hypothesize that with the current architecture of the school, the face-to-face interactions among faculty will be departmentally oriented; that cross-building communication will be very limited and the system as a whole will be somewhat segregated. This Social Network Analysis (SNA) which I shall construct will offer visual representation of the interactions taking place within school. With the given information, this question is addressed: What variables within the system could potentially be altered to provide a more connected network; a network where face-to-face communication between faculty and students is facilitated and encouraged?

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MUSIC ON SHORT TERM MEMORY
James Patrick Dalton
La Salle High School, Milwaukie, Oregon, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to find how different music genres affect one's cognitive ability, specifically short term memory. The initial idea was to find which types of music affect memory the most. It turned out that the type of music did not matter as much as I presumed. The subjects responded best to no music and worst to rap.<br><br>The subjects were shown sequences of letters then asked to write them down while listening to different types of music. The subjects were graded by how many they got correct out of seven sequences for each genre. A correct sequence required the subject to remember both the correct letters and the correct order. The overall average correct was about 3.2 out of 7. <br><br>The music genres included rock, classical, rap, and slow music. The subjects also took part in a control (no music). The subjects scored the highest while listening to classical music (3.33/7) and scored the worst while listening to rap (2.93/7). When they listened to no music they averaged 3.43 out of 7.<br><br>The data suggests that it is best to listen to no music while doing something that requires short term memory. Boys and girls also have around the same short term memory ability. However, the statistical analysis was not sufficient enough to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, while the data suggests that music affects short term memory, the results of this study do not conclusively establish that it does.

THE EFFICACY OF SELECTED BIOFEEDBACK TECHNIQUES IN MITIGATING SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
Michael Joseph Berger
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, New York, USA 

I conducted a case study with a human subject (adolescent male) diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The study will be carried out with the goal of helping the subject to “self-soothe” by learning to effectively utilize conventional biofeedback techniques, thereby lessening his need to express frustration through socially unacceptable behaviors. To evaluate the efficacy of the biofeedback treatments administered to children with autism, a social and behavioral scale/report (the "Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist” or “ATEC”), is completed by the parent of the subject pre-treatment, periodically throughout the treatment, and post-treatment. This scale measures any improvements within four categories of specified behaviors, and differs from previous scales/tests which were instruments primarily designed to diagnose autism rather than to measure gradations of symptom improvement. The outcome thus far has been that the regimen of biofeedback therapy has helped the subject to measurably mitigate symptoms associated with his diagnosed disorder. This is evidenced by the pre-treatment ATEC report, which measured the overall score of the severity of the subject’s autistic symptoms to be “28” (the higher the score, the greater the subject’s impairment), having improved to a “22” by week 4 of the study. Furthermore, the most substantially affected area was sociability, which improved by 4 levels (“13” to “9”) from the pre-treatment ATEC report to the latest ATEC report. This study’s findings strongly suggest that conventional biofeedback therapy may be an effective treatment option to mitigate certain symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (especially symptoms which fall under the category of sociability).

EVEN FOOTING: THE EFFECT OF PERSONALITY TYPE ON PERFORMANCE IN MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTING
Erika Elizabeth Swartz
West Potomac High School, Alexandria, Virginia, United States of America

This research study examined the effect of MBTI personality type on performance in multiple choice testing. It aimed to determine qualitatively whether or not the format of multiple choice testing rewards the intuitive thinking style to the detriment of sensates.. Some literature suggests that timed multiple choice testing favors the intuitive type. Based on this study, the researcher hypothesized that intuitives would outperform sensates on a general multiple choice test. Thirty two subjects were given a General Knowledge Multiple Choice Test designed by the researcher and a personality inventory. The subjects, 11th grade AP US students, were 40% intuitive, 50% sensing, and 10% type inconclusive. The subject’s test performance was analyzed by questions correct out of completed, number of questions completed, and scored PSAT-style. t-tests determined that there was no statistically significant difference between the performance of the types in any category. However, the 75th percentile of test scores was 60.2% intuitive. Upper percentiles in general contained more intuitives than sensates and the general subject pool. This phenomenon merits further investigation. A large national test pool of PSAT and SAT takers already exists. Standardized testing and testing in general are of critical importance to student’s careers. Strategies of the successful type could be used to help the less successful type perform to potential on tests. This study also has implications for the test preparation industry.

DOES THE BRAIN COMPUTE MATHEMATICAL RISK? THE INFLUENCE OF RISK AND REWARD ON THE ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR OF HUMANS
Aditya Maruti Palepu
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Tech., Alexandria, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine how reward values impact perceived risk by humans. Human risk analysis plays a major role everyday as they operate on perceived risk and not on mathematical risk. Since perceived risk deals with several computations through the brain’s higher cognitive areas, we explored the effects of age in this experiment. A computer based java Roulette game was devised for subjects in three age groups: 12-20 (Children), 21-25 (College kids), and 26-50 (Adults) years. The game involved two wheels with distinct number of sectors and a preset bet value, each of which were varied between trials. The choices of the subjects (i.e. playing certain wheels over others based on their perceived riskiness, chances of winning, the bet value, and potential earnings) are captured for each subject. The average risk taken by the subjects is evaluated at all reward values using the weighted pairwise comparison method. The shape and nature of the graph (i.e. flat, linear, sigmoid) allowed us to evaluate the two system hypothesis. The pooled results show no significant difference between children and college kids, however showed significant differences between adults and the other two groups. The younger age groups tended to play the game with lower risk at all bet values compared to the adult group. The two system hypothesis acts slightly differently in this scenario by not having both systems collaborate to make an “intermediate” decision, but rather the subject used either one or the other.

PHER OR UNPHER? PHEROMONE INFLUENCE ON HUMAN PREFERENCE AND THE EFFECT OF CIGARETTE SMOKING.
Christian LeeAnne Young
San Jacinto Christian Academy, Amarillo, Texas

This study evaluated the effect of synthetic human pheromones on the preference of humans for inanimate objects. The study was double-blinded with all variables controlled. Synthetic male pheromone validated by published research was obtained. 100 female subjects were presented with two pieces of gauze in plastic bags with unique identifiers: one had one drop of pheromone. Each gauze was evaluated by feel, visual inspection, and smell for 60 seconds and subjects were asked to choose a preferred one. Recorded data included age, infectious symptoms, allergy symptoms, history of smoking, ability to smell, menstrual history, and the reason for their choice. 57% of all subjects (p=0.03) and 63% of non-allergic/infected (p=0.011) chose the pheromone gauze. 44% of women chose due to smell; 70% of these women (p=0.003) and 76% 18-40 years (p=0.001) chose the pheromone gauze. 57% of women 18-30 years (p=0.113) and 61% of women 31-40 years (p=0.029) chose the pheromone gauze; women over 40 appeared to choose randomly. Male pheromones influenced the preference of females in an age-related fashion. <br><br> Ten smokers were originally evaluated -- they chose the pheromone gauze only 50% of the time consistent with random chance. Fifty additional smokers were tested. Only 37% of the 60 smokers (p=0.00035) chose the pheromone gauze with no age differentiation. Less than 3 pack-year smokers chose randomly; higher exposure induced a negative response. Smoking was able to negate or reverse the positive effect of human pheromones. Smoking-pheromone response knowledge may be beneficial for anti-smoking campaigns. Subjects continue to be evaluated.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF PHENOTYPIC VARIATIONS ON A BISPECTRAL INDEX LEVEL DURING SLEEP
Adare Marie Morell
Okaloosa Walton Collegiate High School, Niceville Fl, United States

Research has demonstrated that persons with red hair require more anesthesia during surgery. This known fact about a practical difference that this phenotypic characteristic may play a role in led me to my investigation. I obtained a machine called the BIS monitor. The BIS is a processed Electroencephalography (EEG) parameter, derived from measurements which are then represented in a single number. The BIS has been shown to be a continuous measure of a person's hypnotic state, with numbers from 100 when the subject is wide awake, to 0 when brain activity is absent. I measured the Bispectral Index Level (BIS) during natural sleep and hypothesized that phenotypic variations of the individual being tested would affect the BIS reading. <br><br> I studied 19 persons who each spent a one hour period monitored by the BIS. Their lowest Bispectral Index Level was recorded. All reported achieving natural sleep during the monitoring period. The BIS readings were then evaluated to determine if phenotypic differences within the population had an effect.<br><br> Hair color and gender did not demonstrate that they statistically influenced the BIS levels in my study. The non-phenotypic variable of age also failed to statistically show differences in the BIS levels recorded during my study. However, a higher power study with a larger sample size and a more evenly distributed number of red heads vs. non red heads is highly recommended. In my study, it is also indicated that anesthesiologists may want to re-evaluate the BIS level they keep patients suppressed at during surgery due to an indication by my research that shows that humans can enter a significantly lower BIS level during natural sleep than they are suppressed at during surgery.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF PLAYING DIFFERENT VIDEO GAME GENRES ON GEOMETRIC, SPATIAL, AND VERBAL REASONING SKILLS OF ADOLESCENTS
James Edward Thompson
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA

The study attempted to determine the effects of playing different types of video games on geometric, spatial, and verbal reasoning skills of local adolescents. The video games compared were puzzle, strategy, and role-playing games. The study also proposed to determine any gender differences in performance in the three cognitive abilities. Each participant completed a five-minute pretest in a cognitive reasoning category, played a video game for fifteen minutes, and completed a structurally identical, but somewhat different posttest. On the test, the participant noted his or her gender and the average number of hours the participant had played video games over the previous two-month period. All video games were rated appropriate for everyone by the ESRB and contained no emotionally stressing material. All testing was conducted at approximately the same time of day in similar physical surroundings. There was also a control group that did not play any video game. The control group had highly restricted behaviors to prevent any use of the cognitive abilities in the study; the data of this group provides a useful standard of comparison with that of the experimental groups. The results of the study indicate that there are no significant effects of playing any game on any of the reasoning abilities. Furthermore, the data also suggests that there are no significant gender differences in performance in geometric, spatial, or verbal tasks. Finally, the results indicate that most high school students play little or no video games.

WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO BECOME SERIAL KILLERS?
Samantha Paige Elizabeth Rowe 
Marion Harding High School, Marion, Ohio, USA 

I believe that childhood experiences can be linked as a factor causing people to become serial killers. This is because childhood experiences play a major role in adult life. If the child does not learn how to deal with stress and abuse properly, then this could cause negative effects on the child in their later years. <br><br>I gathered data from a database, which gave a list of a little over a hundred serial killers and mass murderers. The mass murderers were separated from the serial killers and were not included in my research. I also received from the internet several profiles. I did a factor analysis that used 33 serial killers and 10 variables. I could only use 33 serial killers because they were the only individuals that had information available for all 10 variables. The variables I included were:<br><br>Childhood risk factors; Age of 1st sexual experience; Military history; Triad (animal torture, bed wetting, and fire setting); Psychological risk factors; Birth order; Number of victims; Behavior during crime factors; After death behavior; and Age when arrested. <br><br>In the factor analysis I looked at four factors because I had four eigenvalues that were above 1.00. I concluded from my loading values that the four different factors were:<br><br>Psychological Risk Factors<br><br>Environmental Factors<br><br>Genetic Factors<br><br>Sexual/Deviant Behavior<br><br>I found that there are several factors as to what makes people kill. Childhood experiences do play a major role but so do several other factors, such as genetics and experiences throughout life.<br><br>

INATTENTIVE BLINDNESS: DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?
Nicholas Ryan Waggy
Upper Sandusky High School, Upper Sandusky, Ohio, United States

Inattentive blindness is what occurs when an individual is trying to focus on a particular event in an environment where there is an excessive amount of stimuli. The brain acts like a filter and ignores what is not relevant to the task at hand. This allows for very obvious events to go unnoticed. <br><br>Teachers face many dilemmas in the classroom today. One is the basic problem of how to get students to focus on the topic at hand without becoming distracted. <br><br>Students were administered a short learning styles quiz, and a pre experimental survey. The experiment was explained, tasking the subjects with counting how many times a basketball was passed during a short video. The students were not told that an unexpected event would occur during the video. Following the movie, a post experimental survey was administered and collected. <br><br>Of 220 individuals who participated, those that saw the unexpected event had three characteristics in common: visual learning style, right handed, and uncorrected vision. Four females (2.8 percent of the population) and one male (1.8 percent of the population) noticed the unexpected event’s occurrence. Due to the small number of participants that noticed the unexpected event, it does not support the hypothesis that individuals who are visual learners would be most likely to see the unexpected event. <br><br>

WHO'S IN CHARGE? THE EFFECT OF SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES ON THE HUMAN MIND
Chelsea Gail Almany
Herculaneum High School, 1 Blackcat Drive, Herculaneum, Missouri

The question in this study was how much of an influence, if any, subliminal messages have on viewers’ color choice. Subliminal images, signals or messages below the normal levels of perception, were first tested in the 1950s. The success of the messages eventually led to their ban by the FCC in the 1970s.<br><br> The initial idea for this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of visual subliminal messages on viewers, and it was hypothesized that the messages would have a distinct effect on viewers’ choices.<br><br> Two copies were made of a 30-second color video clip. One video was left alone, and in the other, a single frame of the word "BLUE" in blue letters was inserted after 15 seconds. 40 viewers watched the first video, and 40 different viewers watched the second, unedited video. After watching the video once, test subjects were then given a set of five colors (red, green, blue, orange, and yellow) from which to choose. When shown the video with the subliminal messages, 35% of viewers chose blue. However, in the video without the subliminal messages, only 22.5% viewers chose blue.<br><br> The experiment demonstrated that visual subliminal messages do have a small effect on viewers’ color choice; therefore, the hypothesis was supported. However, these results could change if viewers were chosen from a more varied age group, or if the messages were shown at an earlier or later point in the video. Backmasking and other forms of audible subliminal messages could also demonstrate different results.

HUMAN PERCEPTION OF MISSING FUNDAMENTALS IN MUSIC AND SPEECH
Karl Matthew Speer
Central Virginia Governor's School, Lynchburg, Virginia, United States

As technology allows for smaller and smaller audio devices—mp3 players, cell phones, radios—the diminishing size causes certain portions of the reproduced frequency spectrum to be omitted, thus coloring the sound. This research was conducted to determine whether humans perceived missing fundamental frequencies with more ease in either music or speech. Forty pairs of audio tracks consisting of either music or speech were played to a college-age student. Half of the music pairs and half of the speech pairs had a fundamental removed from one member of the pair. Nine subjects were instructed to listen to the audio pairs and responded whether they perceived a difference in the pairs. The study was conducted at a local women’s college at scheduled times from December 12 to December 15 of 2006. It was discovered through a Chi-squared test that missing fundamentals in music were perceived with more ease than in speech (p < .0001). A significant relationship (p < .02) was found between missing fundamental perception and the instrument producing the perceived note through another Chi-squared test. A third Chi-squared test revealed a significant relationship (p < .005) between missing fundamental perception and the pitch of a note.

BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHITE GENE AS A PHENOTYPIC MARKER IN W1118 AND CS DROSOPHILA
Mary Martha Ferrari Douglas
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, USA

The white gene (w) is commonly used as a phenotypic marker in drosophila for studies ranging from behavioral analysis to gene regulation. W is a precursor of eye pigmentation and produces an easily distinguishable white eye by depleting tryptophan levels. However, recent courtship studies suggest that it could be playing a larger role on drosophila behavior. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of W on drosophila sleep patterns and memory in two strains of drosophila, to evaluate the appropriateness of W as a phenotypic marker. Male control red (w+) and male white eyed (w-) drosophila from two strains, w1118 and CS, were monitored for sleep activity over 24hs. Drosophila were tested for memory in the heatbox learning paradigm. After collecting data from approximately 220 flies per group (CS w-, CS w+, w1118 w-, w1118 w+), results demonstrate that sleep behaviors, activity and memory all significantly differed between the eye colors, suggesting that the white gene is not a suitable genetic marker. Furthermore, previously published studies that utilized the marker may have presented convoluted results.

INTERPERSONAL BEHAVIOR AND SPACING ON PUBLIC BENCHES: AN OBSERVATIONAL PROJECT CONDUCTED IN DC METRORAIL STATIONS
Anne Kelly Minoff
Yorktown High School, Arlington, VA, USA

A significant factor influencing human behavior in public spaces is a desire to defend one’s personal space from encroachment by strangers, and oneself from unwanted attention. One method for preserving personal space and decreasing the chances of interaction is to increase physical distance from strangers. It was hypothesized that people would consider strangers of the opposite gender to be more threatening than strangers of the same gender, and that this difference would be reflected by greater seating distances between those of opposite genders in public places.<br><br>Fifty-two people were observed choosing seats beside strangers on public benches. Each subject’s gender and relative distance to his or her bench-mate was recorded. Distances were approximated using a 10-to-one scale. Any behaviors exhibited by subjects, including reading, talking on a cell phone, etc., were recorded in observations. An ANOVA test run on the distance data supported the null hypothesis, revealing no statistical difference in seating distances between those of the same or opposite gender. However, an analysis of observational notes taken on each seating interaction suggested that subjects sitting at closer distances were more likely to display “avoidance behaviors,” including reading, listening to music, using cell phones, and angling their bodies away from their bench-mates, than were those sitting farther apart, regardless of gender. An ANOVA test run on this data revealed statistically significant differences in seating distances between people exhibiting avoidance behaviors and people not exhibiting such behaviors, suggesting a correlation between seating distance and the use of avoidance behaviors.<br><br>

THE CUTTING EDGE OF INTERNET JOURNALING
Belinda Emily Daniel
Niles North High School, Skokie, Illinois, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to study the effectiveness of the internet journaling site, LiveJournal™, in observing correlations of mental health, age, and suicidal tendency with substance use, suicidal tendency, and posting frequency respectively, among users who post to self-injury communities. <br><br> In this experiment, 8 different self-harm communities on LiveJournal™ were randomly selected, and among them, 5 users per community. These 40 users were profiled for their age, their mental health (whether they had diagnosed medical conditions), suicidal tendencies (whether they have attempted suicide or talked of ending their life), substance use (drugs or alcohol), and the frequencies of their posts. Then, the data was organized into three separate sets: the first to observe correlations between the severity of the condition and the severity of the substance use; the second, between age and suicidal tendency; and the third, between suicidal tendency and posting frequency.<br><br> The results were fairly inconclusive. The data indicated no observable increase in substance use as mental health worsened, that the age of suicidal users appeared to be higher than the age of non-suicidal users and that the frequency of posts was higher among those who were not suicidal. These results were not supported with statistical evidence, so they cannot be deemed significantly higher.<br><br>

ADOLESCENT TANNING AS DEPENDENT BEHAVIOR
Scott Lee Greenberg
Syosset High School, Syosset NY, USA

In order to better understand adolescent tanning, the possibility that tanning practices among adolescents were similar to Substance Dependence was examined. In order to address this question artificial tanning and natural tanning behaviors in an adolescent population were evaluated according to the American Psychiatric Association’s criteria for Substance Dependence. It was found that 8.2% of all respondents qualified for Artificial UVL SSD (substance similar dependence) and 21.1% of all respondents qualified for Natural UVL SSD within the last 12 months. Females exhibiting criterions one, three, and seven of the modified APA criteria and whose parent’s either artificially or naturally tanned were seen as the population that was most inclined to have SSD. In addition, the knowledge of the hazardous effects of tanning prevented significantly less subjects who have SSD from tanning, compared to those who did not have SSD. The similarity between SSD and Substance Dependence indicate that substance awareness programs can be used as models for discouraging adolescent tanning.

THE IMPACT OF VISION-RELATED BEHAVIORAL FACTORS ON MYOPIA DEVELOPMENT ACROSS LEVELS OF PARENTAL MYOPIA
Tina Liu
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY, USA

Although parental myopia has been positively associated with myopia, it is unclear what factors prevent some children with two myopic parents from becoming myopic and what factors cause other children with no myopic parents to become myopic. Public awareness and attitude concerning myopia and behavioral intervention methods are also largely unexplored. This study investigated the differences in visual activities between myopic and nonmyopic adolescents within the three levels of parental myopia (zero, one, and two myopic parents) and evaluated their awareness of myopia’s etiology and good eye care habits. Two-hundred-sixty-eight high school students voluntarily completed a questionnaire. Results showed that the proportion of myopes increased as the level of parental myopia increased (chi-square=16.7; p=0.002). Myopes with no myopic parents performed 32.2 more weekly diopter hours of nearwork (p=0.051) and 10.7 fewer weekly hours of outdoor/sports activity (p<0.001) than corresponding nonmyopes. Conversely, nonmyopes with two myopic parents performed 43.3 fewer weekly diopter hours (p<0.05) and 6.6 more weekly hours of outdoor/sports activity (p<0.05) than corresponding myopes. Most subjects attributed myopia to both heredity and environment (72.7%) and were positive toward good eye care habits (68.8%). The results suggest that having myopic parents, performing a high amount of nearwork, and performing a low amount of outdoor/sports activity are three accumulative risk factors for myopia. Therefore, children with all three risk factors were identified as a high risk population that may be most sensitive to methods of myopia intervention. These results may ultimately contribute to combating the rising prevalence of myopia.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN HYPERSENSITIVITY BEHAVIOR IN A RAT MODEL OF AUTISM
Sarah Kirsch
Ward Melville High School, Setauket, NY, USA 

Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, with language, cognitive and social impairment, often accompanied by hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity interferes with the ability to learn, reach one's full potential, and enjoy a typical quality of life. Injecting rats with 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT), a serotonin agonist, has been used to produce a hyperserotonemic model of autism. This animal model can facilitate discovery of the etiology of such behaviors in humans. Human autistic females are more cognitively impaired than males. There is a dearth of research on autistic symptoms in females. This study utilizes the hyperserotonemic rat model of autism to analyze male and female differences in hypersensitivity to tactile, auditory and olfactory stimuli. Rats were tested in an open field, from postnatal day 137 through 147. Atypical behaviors in rats can be compared to atypical behavioral indicators of autism in humans. During the tactile test, hyperserotonemic female rats exhibited a stronger reaction than hyperserotonemic male rats. The former kept their tails off the floor a longer time. In the auditory test, hyperserotonemic female rats crossed more grid lines than hyperserotonemic male rats. The former demonstrated more escape behavior in the presence of the auditory stimuli. In the olfactory test, hyperserotonemic female rats held their head directly over odors for more seconds than the hyperserotonemic male rats, indicating an increased self stimulatory behavior in the former. Hyperserotonemic female rats were found to be more hypersensitive than males to all three stimuli tested.

LEARNING OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS OF THE MATTER THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE MUSEUM WITH CBTIS 119 STUDENTS.
Karen Isabel Yada
CBTis 119, Victoria City, Tamaulipas, Mexico

Biology teaching has been developed at the CBTis 119 through traditional classes. This teaching model omits didactic or alternative science teaching factors. Influences in the correct understanding of Biology class topics, in particular with the organization levels of the matter topic which is the main idea of this research.<br><br>The main aim of this project is do evaluate a methodological strategy for Biology teaching; which will allow to explore the possibilities of an interactive museum for the teaching innovation of the topic already mentioned. In addition, it will create a learning environment were students will develop their social and cognitive areas. <br><br>AVIKI is a prototype done from recyclable materials. It has a tree form, because it is the image of Biology. It also has a spiral order in which the 19 levels of the organization of life are represented. This form allows to construct a mental map and to organize the information. <br><br>The experimental hypothesis is based on the achievement of a significant learning through the use of the interactive museum AVIKI (auditive, visual and kinesthetic). This is developed through a constructivist didactic sequence with the aim of facilitating knowledge construction, achieving significant learning. <br><br>The data analysis was carried out with the hypothesis T-Test for related samples. The time punctuations in the pre-test were (0.9283<1.6783) and in the pos-test (2.3173>1.6733) with a liability of 95% and 5% of margin of error. These results allow accepting the experimental hypothesis and null hypothesis.

A GAME OF THEORY
Willie Tenell Reaves
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if the “uniqueness factor” of game theory influences the selections that students make on exams. Published research indicated that interior options are often chosen over exterior options, and therefore Survey 2 was used to verify the validity of my hypothesis. An interior option indicates options two or three on the survey, because they are on the “inner” section of the page, while the first and fourth options are external, being at the top and bottom of the page. <br><br>The surveys were administered to a random sample of fifty Muskogee High School students. After locating a willing participant, the project and its associated Consent Form were explained to him/her, and his/her understanding of both were ascertained. The participant completed the surveys and Consent Form, which were numerically organized according to each participant, and the data was recorded in a data log. <br><br>After conducting data analysis, it was determined that the majority (56%) of students chose the most unique option on Survey 1, and that 30% of students chose the most unique option on Survey 2. Survey 1 was designed to test distinctiveness, and Survey 2 to ascertain the accuracy of results. <br><br> The conclusion of this experiment was that there was not enough evidence to support my null hypothesis, and thus that uniqueness of options does indeed affect students’ exam choices. <br><br>

PSYCHO-SOCIAL EFFECTS CAUSED BY PATERNAL ABSENCE ON CHILDREN BETWEEN 7-11 YEARS OLD WITH SOLUTION BY MEANS OF EXERCISES THAT STIMULATE DIALOGUE
Scott Miguel Munguia
Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan Jalisco, Mexico

The project has as objectives to determine the psycho-social effects caused by paternal absence (PA) on children between 7-11 years old, and to determine if the exercises that stimulate dialogue can improve their social skills. An own measurement instrument was designed for this project with the purpose to give an approximation to the development of 12 social skills on children. This instrument has 86 items and was applied in 2 stages by using a non-probabilistic sampling method. First stage: n=140 children between 7-11 years old were divided in 2 equal parts; half with PA and half with paternal presence (PP). Social skills of both groups were observed and analyzed on normal class work, and they were compared. Second stage: exercises that stimulate dialogue were created and applied to n=10 children between 7-11 years old with PA. The development of the social skills of these children were registered and evaluated 5 times during 20 days. Results: children between 7-11 years old with PA have less development in all evaluated skills than children with both parents. Coyness and apathy were the social conflicts that appeared more (27% and 24% respectively). Children of 7 years old with PA have a bigger conversation skill (73%) than children with PP (66%); however, this skill diminishes significantly on the following years. The exercises that stimulate dialogue improved 32% the social skills of children with PA. According to the results exists a problem with social behavior on children with PA. Exercises that stimulate dialogue could solve it. <br><br>

PERSONALITY AND SUCCESS IN EDUCATION
Telena Billie
Wingate High School, Fort Wingate, New Mexico, USA

The purpose of this research is to determine if being right or left-brained and/or personalities affect learning styles. While in the process of doing my experiment, I found out that being right or left-brained does not affect your learning style as much as personality does. This conclusion was determined as a result of student surveys. One hundred students, twenty-five from each grade (nine through twelve), took three psychology surveys. One tested personality, one tested learning style and the last tested whether or not the student was left or right-brained. Results were gathered and compared statistically by grade level and showed personality type was by far the most influential factor in student learning. The focus of this research suggests that if teachers were able to identify certain personality types, students could learn more successfully. <br><br> <br><br>

FACE TO FACE A CROSS ETHNIC OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Brandy RaeAnn Buchanan
Central Noble High School, Albion, Indiana, USA

All around the world, humans are constantly showing their emotions by the expressions on their faces; but can people of various ethnicities read the faces of those in ethnic groups other than their own? How well can children determine the emotions behind facial expressions of other races? This project focused on primary grade, Caucasian children arbitrating these expressions of children their own age from four various ethnicities. Participants were instructed to match set expressions of happy, sad, scared, surprised, angry, and bored (independent variables) with predetermined photographs (dependent variables) of each of these expressions for all four ethnicities. Results were analyzed to determine which ethnic group was most accurately verified. <br><br> I hypothesized that the Caucasian children would establish the Caucasian group the most precisely, followed by the Asian group. The next legitimate responses would be for the Latino group, and the children would answer the African American group the most erroneously. Data showed the children's responses varying not only by races, but by grade (maturation rate) and expression difficulty. The experimental results concluded that the children were able to deduce the Asian group with the least flaws, with the Caucasian group falling in second. The Latino group was the next most accurately answered, and the African American group was the most mistaken overall. This experiment also showed which facial expressions were most easily justified, and which ones presented harder concepts for primary children.

ASSOCIATION OF SIBLING RIVALRY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES OF MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
Arthi Satyanarayan
Hamilton High School, Chandler, Arizona, USA

Sibling rivalry is a type of competition or animosity among brothers and sisters, blood-related or not. Healthy family environments could lead siblings to motivate each other, whereas family environments with family conflict could have a more negative effect on the relationship between siblings. The ability to regulate emotions entails modulating emotional experience to attain desired affective states and adaptive outcomes. Family conflict is associated with negative psychological outcomes in children, such as aggression and hostility, anxiety, depression, and poor self-efficacy. Thus, sibling rivalry was tested against personal mastery, depression and anxiety, hostility, achievement motivation, and family conflict. Participants from higher-conflict families reported more sibling rivalry (R=.420, p<.01). It was found that higher sibling rivalry was correlated with increased hostility (R=.229, p<.01) and depression (R=.306, p<.01), but lower sense of personal mastery (R=-.115, p<.05), and achievement and grade point averages (R=-.097, p<.05). There was no evidence that the relation between the psychological variables differed based on family conflict. Even in low conflict families, more sibling rivalry was associated with more psychological distress. Furthermore, it was found that families with married parents and families with divorced parents tend to have similar amounts of sibling rivalry, differing only by a .02 correlation. Thus, parental arrangement may not be as significant to sibling rivalry. However, the degree of competition— motivating (in low conflict), or degrading (in high conflict)— may be a possible explanation why parental arrangement was not statistically significant to sibling rivalry.<br><br>

DRESS FOR SUCCESS
Aubrey Lynn Hasvold
Blevins Junior High School, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to examine whether men and women will differ in their willingness to take a short survey from someone nicely dressed and groomed compared with someone dressed in grungy attire and poorly groomed. It was also investigated whether men's reactions would differ significantly form women's.<br><br> To test this hypothesis, a mock survey was given to 25 men and 25 women in a nice outfit one day, and a grungy outfit the next. A Two-Sample Hypothesis Test for Proportions was conducted to examine the significance of each gender’s reaction for each outfit.<br><br> When the survey administrator was dressed and groomed nicely, 52% of the men and 60% of the women agreed to take the survey; 48% of the men and only 16% of the women agreed to take the survey when the administrator was dressed in grungy attire. The Test for Proportions revealed a significant difference in reaction to the two appearances for women and for both genders combined, but no mathematically significant difference for men.<br><br> From a physiological standpoint, these results support the theory of behavioral contrasts due to structural differences between the male and female brain, specifically in the corpus callosum. In women, this part is generally wider and has more connecting fibers between the two hemispheres as well as in the visual and emotional regions of the brain than in men's, allowing for greater cross talk. The results show the importance of presenting one's self appropriately in order to elicit a desired response.<br><br>

EFFICACY OF THE MODIFIED CONDITIONED DEFEAT MODEL IN ODOR RECOGNITION
Rajasree Roy
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, Georgia, USA

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder causes severe psychological consequences subsequent to highly stressful events. Since competition for necessary resources and agonistic interactions determine an animal’s longevity, many animal species experience social stress. One method for examining the physiological and behavioral effects of social stressors is known as conditioned defeat. In this, an experimental animal is defeated by a larger, more aggressive animal. After initial defeat, the animal shows submission even to a smaller, non-aggressive intruder. A previous model presented variability in the behaviors of non-aggressive intruders. Thus, the goal of this study was to elicit submissive behavior in the experimental animal when exposed to a caged-stimulus animal twenty-four hours post-defeat. Hamsters rely heavily on their olfactory systems and display good fear responses. For these reasons, they are viable experimental subjects and enable odor recognition to be used to determine how hamsters respond when exposed to the same or different stimulus animal post-defeat. Defeated animals actively avoided the caged-stimulus animal and were submissive. However, undefeated animals were highly social. The effects of conditioned defeat elicited anxiety in subjects in an elevated plus maze twenty-four hours following testing. Naïve animals spent the longest time in the closed and center arms, followed by the defeated group and undefeated group, respectively. Therefore, by studying the effects of stress in hamsters, a better understanding of stress in humans and other organisms can be gained, and steps can be taken to lessen the detrimental consequences.<br><br>

SUBLIMINAL MINDS
R. Mac DeRose
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head, SC, USA

A subliminal message is defined as a signal or message embedded in another object, designed to pass below the normal limits of perception. The course of the experiment tested whether subliminal messages affected the subjects' decision making process. Subliminal messages are usually thought of as an antiquated, illegal form of advertising for a certain product. For this reason, the subjects were tested with an often marketed product: candy. Five different messages were placed on a computer using the program Subliminal Mind. Subjects were directed to watch a scene from a movie, as if they were watching it for comprehension. Then, without their knowledge, they were tested whether the subliminal messages affected their judgment. Each message involved a different way of telling the viewer to choose a certain color of candy. The subject was not told anything about the candy prior to a tray of candy appearing after the movie. They chose from this tray of multi-colored candy (containing two of each of the five colors). The subjects were told to choose one piece of candy, without revealing the reason. The messages seemed to have an effect on slightly over half of the subjects, as 54% chose the color given in the subliminal message. Many of the subjects may have had a predetermined favorite flavor of the candy and naturally ignored the subliminal messages. The experiment, however, did determine that subliminal messages do have an effect on many of the people exposed to them. A Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test was performed and it provided significant evidence that something must have altered the results. The subliminal messages, overall, affected the subjects' decision making process.

CATEGORY SPECIFIC SEMANTIC DEFICITS OF OBJECT RECOGNITION IN ADULTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE
Mounir Ahmad Koussa
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America

The question of impairments in object naming in patients with brain damage being category specific, living vs. non-living, is unresolved Most studies exploring the concept have been individual case studies where data were not significant. This project sought to answer the question of whether category specific double dissociation occurs and if it does, to determine which regions of the brain are associated with specific category naming. Twelve patients with damage and twelve controls were tested with images from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. The tests consisted of sixty-four pictures; one test evaluated naming ability and the other evaluated comprehension. After the number of correct answers for each test were determined, the living scores were subtracted from the non-living scores generating an effect size. Results of the testing show that there was a double dissociation, the four patients who showed the double dissociation either did more poorly in naming living or non-living objects. All information was statistically analyzed using T-Tests and Chi-Squared yielding P-values of .0004 for the Naming test and .029 for the comprehension test. These data were correlated with the patients’ MRI scans. Impairment in the naming of living things was associated with damage in the anterior inferior temporal cortex; impairment in naming non-living things was correlated with the left fronto-parietal cortex. These regions are dedicated to interpreting visual/sensory information and object use/functional information respectively, therefore supporting the hypothesis that a double dissociation occurs due to the brain interpreting living objects visually and non-living objects functionally.

HOW DOES TEACHING STYLE IMPACT THE LEARNING OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN SECOND GRADE STUDENTS
Kimberly Alene Blair
Lakeview Senior High School, Lakeview, Oregon, United Stated

I hypothesized that young children learned better through hands on interactions. I tested my hypothesis by studying and testing two classes of second graders. I began by giving both classes pretests. One class I taught the scientific method only by verbal communication. The second class I taught the same subject, but incorporated hands on interaction. I then gave both classes a post test to calculate how much they had learned. I compared the class's tests and came to the conclusion, that children who were taught with hands on interaction incorporated into their lessons learned more, and improved their scores greater from their pretests to their post tests.

CIVILIANS VS. THE MILITARY: PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON THE PERSONALITY USING NAME ANALYSES
Liesl Anne Swoyer
F. W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, Florida, USA

This project explored the personalities of two populations, military and civilian, with the hope of creating a military database that would identify personality traits to better categorize recruits. The two populations were surveyed to find any differences in their personality traits and to determine the predictability of said traits in each group using name analyses. It was predicted that the civilian population would be consistent with the name analyses, and the military population would show different traits than the civilians. A survey was used to collect information on the personality of every subject. Each survey was compared to a controlled name analysis, which describes the subject’s personality based on their name, to confirm the predictability of personality characteristics. The answers given by the civilian population were compared to those of the military population to determine which traits were evident in one group and not the other. Separate statistical analyses were completed to determine the results of this two-part experiment. Binomial distribution and a bell-shaped curve were used in the first analysis. The results of the test revealed that there was not enough evidence to prove that the Kabalarian’s philosophy of name analysis was true at the five percent (0.05) significance level. A large sample statistical test for the difference between two population proportions was used to analyze the results of the second part of the experiment. The outcome of this test demonstrated that there were not significant differences at the five percent significance level to indicate that civilians and military personnel differed in their levels of emotion, extroversion, and/or procrastination.<br><br><br>

A DERMATOGLYPHIC STUDY OF AUTISTIC TWIN PAIRS
Derick John Stace-Naughton
Robert M. LaFollette High School, Madison, WI, United States of America

Dermatoglyphic variables are markers on the skin, formed during early intrauterine life, from the 7th to 21st weeks of gestation. Because of the embryological linkage of neurological and dermatoglyphic development, the analysis of dermatoglyph variables can help determine the abnormalities of intrauterine life that may have affected neurological development (Wolman et al., 1990). Though many dermatoglyphic studies have been conducted on a variety of populations, the current literature is inconclusive in terms of the heritability of dermatoglyphic variables. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the validity of dermatoglyphic variables as determinants of autism spectrum disorders. This study analyzes the dermatoglyphs, and in particular the palmar a-b ridge count, of both monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, in which at least one child had an autism spectrum diagnosis. The sum left and right hand a-b ridge counts, as well as left versus right hand asymmetry counts, were calculated for each twin. Examination revealed no significant relationships between dermatoglyphic variables and the autistic population studied, and a heritability analysis suggests an almost purely environmental basis for autism spectrum disorders.

QUINOLINIC ACID INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY AND THE PROTECTION OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN PLANARIA USING TAURINE
Lacey Nicole Stansill
Seneca High, Seneca, MO, US

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is not curable or reversible. Recent research has shown that the build up of quinolinic acid may be a contributing factor in the development of AD. The purpose of this research was to determine if the supplement taurine can prevent neurotoxicity caused by quinolinic acid. To answer this question planaria were first trained to turn opposite of their preference then placed in solutions containing both quinolinic acid and taurine to see if the learned response was retained. Results showed that only 10% of the quinolinic acid group retained their memory compared to 45% of the taurine and quinolinic acid group. Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the quinolinic acid and the taurine groups, meaning that the taurine acted to protect the planaria’s memory from the neurotoxic effects of the quinolinic acid, thus proving that taurine could used for Alzheimer’s patients to help protect them against neurotoxicity.

HOW SWEET IT IS: THE INFLUENCE OF TASTE PERCEPTION AND SENSITIVITY ON FOOD CHOICE BASED ON TASTE STATUS
Dalene Rene'e Cook
Seneca High School, Seneca Missouri, United States of America

Can the number of taste buds (papillae) you have be a factor in your food choices? Is taste sensitivity linked to the development of obesity? These questions were addressed in this research. Subjects tasted seven different sweeteners and rated them on a Labeled Magnitude Scale, along with 4 genetic taste strips. Subjects’ tongues were dyed and number of papillae were counted in a 7 mm area to determine their taste status. Subjects BMI was measured to classify them as overweight or obese. All this information was statistically analyzed to determine if there was a link between sweet, bitter and metallic detection, taste status, and obesity. There was no relationship found between taste status and BMI. Bitter and metallic tastes of the taste strips were detected significantly more intensely by tasters. For some sweeteners, the supertasters and tasters detected the sweet taste significantly more than the nontasters. It seems that, regardless of taste status, it is the detection of bitter and metallic tastes that affected sweetener choice. Implications of this study reveal that taste status affects food choice and ultimately the health of the individual.

ATTITUDES, EXERCISE AND STRESS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DENTAL STUDENTS-YEAR 3
Sarah Tamar Silverstein
Patrick Henry High School, San Diego, CA, USA

Dental school is stressful, but few studies examine factors that can mitigate stress. This longitudinal study tests the hypotheses that positive attitudes and exercise will be associated with lower stress in dental students, and that the amount and sources of stress will change over time.<br><br>Dental Environment Stress (DES) scale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Stress Rating were completed by dental students during their third year (Year 3) when life satisfaction, optimism, happiness and exercise were also assessed. Stress had been assessed during each of the two previous years. Data was available for 234 students (142 men, 92 women) from Years 1 and 3; 202 from Years 1, 2 and 3. Life satisfaction, optimism, happiness (ps<.0001) and exercise (ps<.05) were inversely associated with DES, PSS and Stress Ratings. Life satisfaction, optimism and happiness increased with exercise. Men, married and older students had more positive attitudes and lower stress. Men, single and younger students exercised more. Stress increased between Years 1 and 3 (ps<.0001 for DES and PSS; p=.048 for Stress Rating), but changes in stress varied by school mirroring changes over time in exercise. Stress from schoolwork was high at Year 1, increased at Year 2 (ps<.01) but decreased at Year 3 (ps<.01). Stress from school atmosphere was low at Year 1 and increased over time (ps<.0001). <br><br>Positive attitudes and exercise were associated with lower stress suggesting possible interventional strategies to benefit dental students. Stress increased and sources changed over time; variation between schools reflects differences in exercise patterns.<br><br>

THE COGNITIVE EFFECTS OF VACCINIUM CORYMBOSUM ON MUS MUSCULUS ANTIOXIDANTS: BERRY A"MAZE"ING?
Alison Rae Ficek
Trinity High School - Dickinson, ND 58601 - USA

The purpose of the conducted experiment was to determine whether antioxidants found in Vaccinium corymbosum have a beneficial effect on human memory. Vaccinium corymbosum is said to be rich in antioxidant properties. I wanted to determine if there was truth to this topic or if the blueberry industry was exaggerating to promote consumers to buy their berries. <br><br> During a five-week trial period, forty Mus musculus were used for experimentation. The Mus musculus were divided into two groups of twenty: a control and an experimental group. Each Mus musculus was marked for identification purposes. The control group consisted of a strict grain diet and the experimental group received a grain/blueberry diet throughout the five week experiment. At the end of each week, each Mus musculus was weighed and put through a maze trial. Times and observational data were recorded.<br><br> My hypothesis stated that the blueberry/grain fed Mus musculus would have higher performances in cognitive tasks in comparison to the strict grain diet group. Due to male aggressiveness, I also hypothesized that the male group would perform the maze tasks more quickly and efficiently than the female Mus musculus. Both hypotheses were rejected. The grain fed Mus musculus had quicker trial times than the blueberry/grain fed Mus musculus. The females performed better in cognitive tasks than the male Mus musculus. I wanted to determine if there was a significant difference between the control and experimental group. By calculating a statistical T-test, I found that there was marginal significance at week five.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VIDEO GAME EXPERIENCE ON LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY PROFICIENCY
Mark A. Vitale
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, United States of America

This study determined whether video-gamers are more proficient at learning laparoscopic surgery than non-gamers. The hypothesis was that video gamers would be more proficient at laparoscopic surgery than non-video gamers because of the dexterity, understanding 2D visuals in a 3D manner, hand-eye coordination, and ability to use a video screen effectively learned from videogames.<br><br>Subjects were asked to fill out a survey about general information and video game usage. An equation was created to determine the “gamer” level of a subject. Subjects were tested on the SZABO-BERCI-SACKIER laparoscopic trainer. Three skill sets created specifically for this study were used to gauge a subject’s skill in laparoscopic surgery. Proficiency was measured using time taken to complete the skill sets.<br><br>Twenty-seven subjects were tested. The average non-gamer took 5:28 minutes to complete the test, casual gamers took 5:01 minutes, frequent gamers took 3:37 minutes, and average extreme gamers took 3:20 minutes.<br><br>The data collected in this study support the hypothesis that video-gamers are more proficient at laparoscopic surgery. There was a strong negative correlation between skill set completion speed and gamer score. The results were subjected to multiple tests of statistical significance all of which supported the hypothesis.

CONTEXT NOT CONTENT: AN FMRI STUDY ON CATEGORICAL RESPONSES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN
Sophia Ariella Porrino
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack, NJ, USA 

The degree of functional specialization in the brain is not well understood. The fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA) are two brain regions that have been implicated in the selective processing of faces and places, respectively. When making specificity arguments, however, it is crucial to realize that images of faces and places differ on more dimensions than solely content. For example, specialized brain activity could be due to differences in eye movements, predictability, familiarity, or the salience or attentional load of the stimuli. I used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if activity in the PPA can be modulated by changes in attentional load rather than solely by changes in content. By creating images of standard faces, unusual faces, standard buildings and unusual buildings, I was able to pair two sets of stimuli in various arrangements and determine which brain areas most active during which conditions. Although I determined that activity in the PPA can be explained by neither changes in attentional load nor by oculomotor processes, I discovered that the presence of diverse stimuli within one run creates powerful contextual changes. In fact, large contextual changes result in shifts in functional specificity. Specifically, the FFA loses sensitivity to place stimuli and the PPA gains sensitivity to place stimuli in the presence of contextual changes. This type of plasticity suggests that individual brain regions can adapt their functionality to different situations and that holistic context is indeed more important than content. The power of context to override content information may well be a general mechanism that operates throughout the entire brain in addition to the visual cortex. Furthermore, this discovery lends insight into improved neurosurgical fMRI procedures and greater accuracy in localizing enemy location during security or combat operations.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC ON BRAKE REACTION TIMES
Cathy Hsi Chen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if different genres of music would have an effect on the speed of breaking reaction times. The absence of music-safety in the Mississippi Driver’s Manual prompted this experiment. <br><br> A wooden foot break was wirelessly connected to a laptop by a mouse. A software program written using Kids Programming Language was designed to test three songs. “Frosty the Snowman”, chosen because it is well known, Mozart’s Concerto in D Major, and a read-a-loud book of The Wizard of Oz with no melody; no music was the control. Subject had to break for 2 specific objects out of 4. The program timed reaction times and recorded incorrect breaking. It randomized the intervals and order of the songs and objects. <br><br> A total of 43 high school students were tested. Results showed that reaction times were fastest while subjects listened to “Frosty the Snowman”, followed by the Concerto, The Wizard of Oz, and lastly no music. The average reaction time for “Frosty the Snowman” was .598848101 seconds. The average reaction time for no music was 0.689595707 seconds. No music had the least mistakes with a 5.4% chance, followed by “Frosty the Snowman” with a 5.5% chance. The Wizard of Oz had the highest chance of mistakes, 24.7%. <br><br> It can be concluded from this experiment that listening to something is better than nothing when it comes to speed. Also, listening to a familiar song is the most beneficial to reaction times, keeping drivers aware, but not distracted. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF FACIAL EXPRESSION ON ALTRUISTIC HELPING IN YOUNG CHILDREN
Sara Kate Spiro
Central Bucks High School West, Doylestown, PA, USA

Altruism has been defined as unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others, and has been found in children as young as 18 months. This study specifically evaluated the effect of facial expression on altruistic behavior in young children. It was hypothesized that a smiling facial expression would increase the likelihood of young children to exhibit altruistic behavior. <br><br> A total of 22 subjects from the ages of 16 to 51 months were randomly divided into a control and an experimental group. All children underwent two tests, designed to quantitate altruistic behavior, which involved picking up a dropped object and retrieving a missing object. <br><br> Exactly half of the subjects showed altruistic behavior on at least one of the two tests. Four of the ten subjects in the control group (40%) exhibited altruistic behavior in at least one test. Seven of the twelve experimental subjects (58%) exhibited altruistic behavior. Subjects in the experimental group were 45% more likely to exhibit altruistic behavior in comparison to subjects in the control group. With this data, the approximate value of a smile in terms of altruism was found as increasing the likelihood of altruistic behavior 1.45 times. A positive correlation was also seen when the extent of altruistic behavior was plotted against subjects’ ages: all altruistic behavior was seen in children of 32 months and older. This study confirmed, using the scientific method, what parents and child development experts have always assumed- a smile increases the likelihood of altruistic behavior in children. <br><br>

VIOLENCE AND ADOLESCENT
Juan Carlos Ortiz-Velazquez
Fermin Delgado Diaz Middle School, Naguabo, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this research is that people get real information related to violence and its effects in adolescents.The problem established was: is violence affecting the social, emotional and intellectual growth of adolescents? The hypothesis was that most of the surveyed adolescents were going to indicate violence affects them emotionally and intellectually. <br><br>To do this research, an eleven question questionnaire was prepared. It was administered to fifty (50) students (thirteen to sixteen years old) from Fermín Delgado Díaz Second Unit Middle School in Naguabo. The answers to each questionnaire were organized into tables. The data was analyzed using graphs.<br><br>After analyzing the data it was found that 100% of the surveyed females considered violence a big problem in school. On the other hand, only 50% of the surveyed males considered violence as a problem that affected the school. It was also found that 90% of the respondents believed that violent persons’ behavior can be associated with poor academic performance. This research has increased awareness of the violence that exits and has existed for a long period time in society. The results confirmed the hypothesis under study in this research. <br><br>

ETHNOMATHEMATICS IN THE GEOMETRIC PATTERNS IN WOVEN FABRICS OF THE INDIGENOUS KALINGAS OF THE PHILIPPINES
Hester Mana Docasao Umayam
Philippine Science High School,Bayombong Nueva Vizcaya,Philippines

This study dealt mainly on finding the frieze patterns applied on the derived patterns acquired from the Kalinga woven fabrics. Addition to this was determining the Kalinga native name and symbol for the Kalinga people or the Kalingas of the derived patterns including if a derived pattern is for the low, middle or high class of Kalingas. The assistance of the Kalinga weavers was sought for this project.<br><br>Microsoft Paint was used to derive the patterns into strips of black and white form from colored woven fabrics.<br><br>This study showed that Kalinga weavers based their patterns from what they can see from their cultures, beliefs, practices, and surroundings but not by the use of mathematics specifically the idea of transformations and frieze patterns. The symbol, rather than the complexity and size of a certain pattern, was the main basis of social stratification. There were also patterns that were applicable to all the groupings of Kalingas. Moreover, the derived patterns were related to each other not only from their symbol for the Kalingas but also from their appearance and the transformations applied to these patterns.<br><br>In addition, the results implied that Kalinga weavers are partly conscious or unaware that they possess a very high sense of symmetry, regularity and order because frieze pattern F7 (translation, horizontal and vertical reflection and rotation) was more frequently seen and used by Kalinga weavers compared to the other frieze patterns. The weavers were designing more patterns for low class Kalingas compared to the other classes.<br><br><br>

IDENTIFYING PATTERNS OF PREFERENCE IN DIFFERENT AGE AGROUPS APPLYING CLUSTER ANALYSIS: IS IT POSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY BEAUTY?
Raissa Orlando Tavares Paes
Escola Americana de Campinas- SP Brazil

Throughout history, the concept of beauty has changed drastically. The apparel modified, following the transformations of the feminine body ideals. What determines if a person is beautiful? What determines if an attire is pretty or not? These questions are still in open and are probably very complex to be totally resolved. To answer some of these questions, an experiment was done using sketches of feminine dresses. First, fifteen gala dresses were drawn. Thirty interviews were performed within three age groups varying from fifteen through eighty years old, where each person ranked the dresses according to ones taste (interview matrix). Thirty variables were then created to characterize the shape and the accessories of the dresses. The data was then standardized due to the numerical scale differences between the continuous and binary variables utilized (variable matrix). The two data matrixes were analyzed using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. The metric resemblance between the dresses and variables was the simple Euclidian distance and the clustering method was UPGMA. The matrixes data were compared between themselves using Mantel test using ultrametric distances. The result was that class 1 (15-25 years) had no relation with class 3 (60 and above). The features that class 3 preferred were those that class 1 most disliked. Class 2 was in between having no relation with both of the other classes. The most coherent was class1 that presented the lowest average standard deviation. Definite patterns were identified correlating age and preference, demonstrating that it is partially possible to quantify beauty.

SMART SHOE PRACTICAL SOLUTION OF THE BLIND
Ahmed Khaled AlNuaimi
AlAnsar Private School, Dammam, Saudi Arabia

The purpose of the Smart Shoes project is to provide the blind and the visually impaired persons with a practical solution to a fundamental problem that they face in their daily life. This problem is the ability to move from place to another by navigating through obstacles without carrying a guiding or walking stick. Many of the blind find carrying a stick embarrassing as it makes them distinctive from the rest of the crowd. This, in many cases, lowers their self-esteem and confidence. <br><br>After reviewing existing inventions and published research and literature, the Smart Shoes solution was found to be a practical solution to the blind’s mobility problem. <br><br>The Smart Shoes works by using ultrasound sensors connected to audible alarming system that alerts the blind to the existence of obstacles. The Smart Shoes is fitted with two sensors on its front side with different detection angles. Both sensors detect objects up to 1.5 m away. <br><br>The Smart Shoes was tested and tried by selected group of blind and visually impaired individuals who were then surveyed to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed solutions. The received feedback concluded that the proposed Smart Shoes is effective and helped the blind and visually impaired persons move safely from one place to another while not feeling embarrassed or sticking out from the crowd. <br><br>The Smart Shoes is powered by rechargeable batteries and contains simple circuitry. In addition, it is and is easy to assemble and is inexpensive. Hence, the Smart Shoes proposed solution is a practical solution. <br><br>

ON THE WAY TO OUR ANCESTORS HOME: INCA WELTANSCHAUUNG OF A CAPACOCHA, IN THE SANCTUARY OF THE SUMMIT OF THE LLULLAILLACO VOLCANO
Mauricio Isaias Montoya
Escuela de Comercio Republica de Panama - Concepcion, Tucuman, Argentina

In the Llullaillaco volcano (Salta, Argentina) 6.739 m high, three Inca children were offered to the gods, more than five hundred years ago. The research objectives are to disclose features of their ritual deaths, to diffuse their Weltanschauung and to spread their scientific and cultural value . <br><br> The 79% of interviewed people ignore the attributes of the naturally frozen mummified bodies . 21% acknowledges the received cultural inheritance. <br><br>Interviewed specialists inform that the Capacocha, (ceremonial ritual death of The Maiden , 15 years, offered to Inti; the boy ,7 years, and the girl ,6 years, perhaps offered to Viracocha and Illapu), began with a procession from Cuzco together with their parents, priests, inspectors and attendants, and lasted one year to arrive to the Volcano. <br><br> Ethnohisstoric and archaeological sources indicate the offerings and worship were carried out before sunset. In the altitude and cold, sleepy with chicha and coca, they were packed and buried alive or suffocated, to become " malqui " (seed). <br><br>Observation and analysis of trousseaus and offerings allow to revalue gears, decorations, shoes; figurines of spondylus ,gold and silver; bags with foods, wood and ceramic objects, showing their Weltanschauung : the certainty of continuing growing in heaven, of transferring nutritious essences to the spiritual beings, to propitiate rain and fertility, becoming their own people’s messengers to the gods, reaffirming the Inca’s deity as son of the Sun. <br><br>Diffusion Workshops of the material testimonies, beliefs and customs will revalue the discovery. <br><br>

THE AFFECT OF COLOR ON STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES
Samuel Craig Furman
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, Florida, U.S.A

The goal of this experiment was to identify if the color of text has an effect on test scores in standardized tests. This was tested utilizing a mock S.A.T. test that was compiled using S.A.T. practice material cited in the parenthetical documentation, along with various created questions. The test was administered to 177 high school juniors enrolled in the I.B. program over a two day period. Students were randomly given different color texts on the tests to complete, and were allotted twenty minutes to answer ten questions based upon two short and one full length passage.<br><br> The test scores were analyzed using t-tests on Microsoft Excel to ascertain a statistical difference between the five colors tested (red, orange, green, blue, and violet) and black, the control, based upon its common use in text today.<br><br> The mean score of red tests was 5.929 and the p-value compared to black was 0.005 whereas the mean score of black tests was 4.811. This indicated that red, by an immense statistical margin, had the largest positive difference to black. The mean scores for the remaining colors, orange, green, blue, and violet were 4.464, 4.357, 4.536, and 4.571, respectively. Also, the standard deviation for red was only 1.804.<br><br> With over 500,000 high students failing high school exit exams yearly, the impact of this experiment could have resounding and incredible effects on education. Implementing red into state and national standardized testing could pass thousands of more students and give them a better chance at graduating.<br><br>

Delavan High School, Delavan, Illinois, USA

The purpose of this research project was to determine whether conditioning has an effect on T-maze completion in female Ratus novegicus. It was hypothesized that Rat A, a female R. novegicus that had been conditioned with getting a treat of peanut butter after hearing a bell ring would complete a multiple T maze faster than either Rat B, a female R. novegicus that heard a bell ringing during maze completion but did not have any previous conditioning, or Rat C, a female R. novegicus that was neither conditioned nor heard a bell ringing during maze completion, and served as the control.<br><br>Three female R. novegicus that were pets of the experimenter were used in the conditioning experiment. Rat A was conditioned daily for seven days by receiving a treat of peanut butter after hearing a bell ring. After the conditioning, all rats were allowed to run a multiple T maze, with Rats A and B hearing the bell ring continuously during the maze activity. Rat C was allowed to complete the maze without hearing the bell. All rats had a treat of peanut butter waiting at the end of the maze. Each rat was allowed to run the maze three times. The time required for each rat to complete the maze was recorded. Rats continued to be pets of the experimenter after experimentation.<br><br>The hypothesis was proven correct. Rat A, had an average run time of 39 seconds, Rat B had an average run time of 51 seconds, and Rat C had an average run time of 48 seconds. Rat B consistently moved through the maze in a direction that was away from the bell, while rat A stopped at intersections of the maze and consistently moved in a direction that was toward the sound of the bell. Rat C moved in no particular pattern through the maze. Conditioning had a positive effect on T-maze completion in female R. novegicus. <br><br>

The present investigation project, title multicreamathematics games, has an objetives increases learning on the students of the high school, using games. The present AND-TO it is an activity and exchange: professor - student, student - student and student - it sets, in which puts at stake a series of intellectual activities, dexterities motorboats and the professor's so much attitudes that it assumes the list of orientador of the learning, like on behalf of the student that is who learns. The problem is ¿ in which degree influences the use of the multicreamathematics games in the learning of the mathematics area, in the students of the fifth degree of secondary education of the Gran Mariscal Ramón Castilla military school? The hypothesis is the learning the mathematics area by the students who are exposed to the muticreamathematics games is increased in greater degree than in those that are not exposed to the multicreamathematics games. The method is experimental, cuasi-experimental design, the of techniques to collect the information were the observation, survey and evaluation(pretest and postest), using the techniques of statistic for the information processing: arimethic average, design standar, variation coefficient and T test for two tests samples. The conclusions is : We compared the learning of mathematical area, in the fifth grade students of secondary education by the use of statistics of the test T for two average samples where the positive influence could be verified that had the multicreamathematics games in the learning., We elaborated and applied the MULTICREAMATHEMATICS GAMES promoting the learning of the “trigonometrical functions”, in the fifth Grade students of Secondary school., We measured the learning level of the “trigonometrical functions” in the fifth grade students of Secondary Education, using the statistical of the test T, comparing the positive influence that has the MULTICREAMATHEMATICS GAMES in the learning. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF CHALLENGE ON VIDEO GAME QUALITY
Kyle Anthony Neblett, Cody Fields
Aloha High School, Beaverton, Oregon, U.S.A.

The Effects of Challenge on Video Game Quality<br><br><br>The purpose of our project was to gain a better understanding of how willing people are to overcome a given challenge (in the form of a video game), and how that degree of challenge makes a game more or less fun. Before our experiment we hypothesized that given an increasingly difficult game, players would become more determined to beat it. We also believed that most players would eventually beat the game after repeatedly playing it. To accomplish this, we created a hand-held video game that tested people on 3 different levels of difficulty.  The project was divided into two main parts: programming and graphics.  Each was designed separately at first, and finally combined to create a playable game.  Once a demonstration level was completed, it was given to 13 human subjects to test.  The length of time needed by a subject to either complete or give up on each difficulty level was recorded.  The change in the amount of time spent on each progressing level of difficulty gave us the amount of time each player was willing to spend at each stage of the game. Although all but 2 players spent more time on the game as it became harder, most reached their limit on the hardest difficulty, and stopped playing. From this we concluded that while players were indeed willing to play longer, most would have been more comfortable playing a game that could be beaten without too much trouble.

THE INFLUENCE OF SELF-ESTEEM IN THE LEARNING PROCESS II
Alexandre Borges Alves Spindola, Lidiane Leal Andriolla
Fundacao Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, RS, Brasil

This project is the result of a research on the influence of self-esteem in the learning process. The primary objective was to verify if the self-esteem of a 4th grade student would affect his learning revenue. For such, self-esteem was measured through the beliefs the student had about his own capability of learning. After that, it was analysed the linear correlation between the measured self-esteem and the learning revenue of the students.<br><br>The research was carried out with 4th grade students from two schools. For the quantitative research, each student received a questionnaire, with 20 items, to measure his “schoolar self-esteem”. This Questionnaire has already passed by an exploratory factorial analysis after being applied on 133 students, for measuring their “school self-esteem”.<br><br>Besides, it was made a qualitaive analysis through interviews with six students from each group, their respective parents and teachers. Thus, a triangulation was made between the quantitative and qualitative methods, which is, according to DENZIN (1989), “the most reliable way of making social researches”.<br><br>With help from the SPSS 14.0 software on the statistical analysis, the results obtained have shown a significant linear correlation (r>0,7; p<0,05) between self-esteem and learning revenue. Therefore, it was concluded that self-esteem has influence on the students’ learning revenue. Besides, it was verified that the idea the parents and teachers have about the child reflect directly on the idea he has about himself. Before such conclusions, the idea is to develop a permanent work at the schools to improve the students’ self-esteem.<br><br>

DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES OF CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WORKED IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF LAKE APOPKA AREA AGRICULTURE: PHASE II
Grant Fabian Chernoby, Shahin Pourkaviani, Francesca Gaete
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if children's abilities were harmed through their parents’ exposure to working in different fields of agriculture with specific focus on the affects of children whose parents worked in plant nurseries. The null hypothesis stated that there is no statistically significant difference in mental and physical capabilities of children whose parents had exposure to pesticides through working in different fields of agriculture around Lake Apopka. The children's mental and physical capabilities were determined through a variety of tests such as a balance or short-term memory test. The children were then divided into groups based on their parent's exposure to work in a field of agriculture around Lake Apopka. The groups consisted of a control, a 1-7 year exposure group, and a plant nursery group. <br><br> A two sample t test was used to determine the confidence level of the tests. The results showed dramatic differences between the children's abilities on many of the tests including hand-eye coordination, balance, and fine motor skills. As the control was compared to the 1-7 year exposure group, then the plant nursery group, the significance level rose. The null hypothesis was rejected and it was shown that pesticides from different agricultural fields had different affects on children. The researchers concluded that pesticides associated with working in plant nurseries produced especially harmful effects to children and that these chemicals were able to be transmitted to the next generation creating a legacy of pesticide damage.<br><br>

BRAINBOW IV: CONDITIONED RESPONSE TO COLOR
Emma Katherine Kearney, William Sheppard Kearney
McIntosh High School, Peachtree City, GA, USA

This study examined the effects of color on the strength of a conditioned response. The hypothesis was that a color with more positive valence (blue) will be more easily conditioned than a color with more negative valence (red). The subjects (N=23), students in college introductory psychology classes, were shown photographs from the International Affective Picture System. The photographs were paired with blue or red solid color slides. Each subject was randomly assigned to one of two groups, either red paired with negative pictures or blue paired with negative pictures. After 36 trials of paired stimuli, the subjects viewed blue and red slides, in random order, for 10 trials. Throughout the study, subjects were monitored on four physiological measurements: corrugator electromyography, zygomatic electromyography, heart rate, and electrodermal activity. There was a nonsignificant trend of the pairing of color with the valence of the pictures on corrugator (frown) muscle activity, such that red showed a stronger conditioning effect when red was paired with negative pictures and blue with positive pictures, F(1,21)=2.34, P=.14. Red was shown to be easily conditioned to negative stimuli, while blue could be conditioned to positive or negative stimuli but with weaker results. The color blue responds better to conditioning across the spectrum of both positive and negative pictures, supporting the hypothesis. For future extensions of this study, culturally- different subjects may be studied to determine if the responses to color come from society and primate subjects may be used to determine if the responses come from evolutionary trends.

AN ANALYSIS OF STUDENT LEARNING BEHAVIORS AS A PRODUCT OF TEACHER EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION
Andrew Joseph Duchi, Caroline Blosser
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington Ohio, United States of America

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of emotion on learning behaviors of high school students. Surveys were distributed to 200 students and 7 teachers. The surveys included questions focusing on attitude (dedication, perception of ability to succeed), emotional state of the classroom, connection to the teacher, goal structure, and feigned emotions. Although the teacher surveys did not offer enough variance to provide significant results, the student surveys generated noteworthy data. A Spearman Rank Order Test was used to determine the correlation between positive emotion and attitude in the classroom, producing a p-value less than .00001, indicating a significant correlation. This correlation shows that positive emotion is not only important in the social-learning based elementary school, but also in the more content-based, higher level education of the high school environment. There was also a correlation between positive attitude and connection to the teacher, but it was not as strong as between attitude and positive emotion. Correlations were also seen between negative emotion, lack of connection, and negative attitude, but all were less significant than the positive emotion and connection correlations; no other variables produced significant correlation. These correlations indicate that positive emotions expressed by a teacher can benefit students and motivate them, establishing a connection to students will help to reinforce positive attitude, and negative emotions have a less significant impact than positive emotions. Thus, teachers should genuinely express themselves to benefits students and to avoid emotive dissonance, which contributes to burnout.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a relationship exists between executive functioning of the brain and academic ability in teenage students in Timber Lake High School. <br><br>Twenty-six students, ranging in age from 14-18, from Timber Lake High School were given the Stroop test. From the Stroop test, the researchers used the intereference score to determine the subject's ability to screen out interference and focus on the task at hand. The same subject’s results from the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT) were provided by the Timber Lake School Guidance Counselor. The counselor matched the OLSAT scores to the corresponding subject’s Stroop test interference scores and concealed the subject’s identity for confidentiality purposes. Statistically, scores from the Stroop test and OLSAT were analyzed for correlation.<br><br>This pilot research study shows that there is no correlation between executive functioning of the brain and academic ability. When each subject’s interference score was graphed against their OLSAT score, the correlation coefficient of the scatter plot data was <br><br>-0.02381.<br><br>

RED BULL GIVES YOU WIINGS
Victoria Amanda Wheeler, Michelle Angelique Wheeler
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of caffeine, Red Bull energy drink, and Sobe energy drink on Mus musculus. To determine which energy drink to use and how much, surveys were completed by one hundred college students to determine the most popular energy drinks consumed. This study analyzed the effects of both Sobe energy drink, Red bull Energy drink, and caffeine on the pulse rate, amount of fluids excreted, and addictiveness on Mus musculus (mice). This project had four phases. To analyze the pulse rate, the mice were given amounts of Red Bull, SoBe Adrenaline Rush, and caffeine by way of a micropipette in proportion to their average mass, and then the pulse rate was recorded using a pulsimeter. For phase two, which recorded the reacton time of the mice when the optimal level of energy drink performance was reached, the mice were introduced to mazes. Their finishing times were recorded. For phase three, which recorded the amount of fluid excreted after consumption of the energy drinks, the same mice in phase one were used. For phase four, which tested the addictiveness of the energy drinks, five mice were selected for both the Red Bull and the Sobe energy drink, making it ten mice in total. Their water bottle was replaced with one filled with the energy drink. After two days, the regular water bottle filled with water was then placed into the cage opposite the water bottle filled with energy drink. The number of times the mice visited either bottle was then recorded. The results showed that both energy drinks increased the pulse rate of the mice, and kept it high for a substantial amount of time. There was a negative correlation between the amount of energy drink consumed and the amount of fluids excreted. Both energy drinks showed the ability to be addictive. The data was analyzed descriptively and statistically to determine the effect it would have on humans.

MAKING THE TRANSITION: PREDICTING HIGH SCHOOL SUCCESS
Christopher Lee Canary, Ross Langlitz Hansen
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, Oregon, USA

For students, one of the most difficult periods in their educational careers is the transition from middle school to high school. As a result, educators need to prepare middle school students for this transition. This study analyzed 8th and 9th grade performance to determine what academic factors--if any--will best determine freshmen year success. Courses were grouped into the 'core' classes - social studies (history), English, mathematics, and science. Since this study is quantitative, freshmen year success was defined as having a high core GPA. Data from the high school classes of 2008 and 2009 were de-identified and gathered from a district computer database.<br><br> Using multivariable linear regression analysis and correlation tables, cumulative middle school core GPA, science GPA, and English GPA were determined to be the greatest factors contributing to overall freshman success, with correlation coefficients of .861, .827, and .825 respectively, to high school core GPA. Furthermore, an analysis of the GPAs for students whose middle school core GPAs were below 3.0 showed a statistically significant increase, whereas the same analysis for students whose middle school core GPAs were greater than or equal to 3.0 showed no change upon entering high school.<br><br> The implications of this study are twofold. Middle school educators can use the results to identify the areas in which students should receive the most help to ensure further educational success; high school teachers can use the findings contained within this study to identify students likely to struggle in the transition to secondary education.

Aginskaya High School #2, v. Aginskoye, Chita region, Russia

This research is a result of experimental work aimed at studying the influence of ethnic peculiarities of family upbringing style on the example of Russian and Buryat families. Modern tendencies of the world development that are caused by globalization and technology improvement have a great influence on the family as an institute. At this stage of the development of our society Russian families are having difficult times. That is why studying of phenomena that happen to a person and the influence of it on one’s development raises a great interest in the science.<br><br>Many researchers define family upbringing as a process of mutual influence between a child and an adult. This very approach to the system of upbringing takes into consideration not only mutual influence of the child and the adult but also some external factors, such as parents’ life experience, the whole cultural experience of mankind, cultural examples and social sub-institutes. <br><br>The influence of ethnic peculiarities on the style of family upbringing is very common nowadays and has not been sufficiently studied. To reveal ethnic peculiarities of family upbringing style, an experimental research was done. According to the aim several diagnostic methods were arranged: a survey and a poll.<br><br>Our experimental research showed that the upbringing style in Buryat and Russian families has no substantial discrepancies but at the same time there is a certain upbringing style defined by ethno-cultural peculiarities that influence teenagers upbringing. The acquired information will allow us to enlarge images about family upbringing in ethno-psychological aspect.<br><br>

It is believed that a child who is overweight may not reach his full potential socially and academically. This project is designed to address that issue. 40 local sixth graders and 39 eleventh graders participated in an experiment by taking a psychological test, self-reporting their Grade Point Average(GPA), having their height and weight measured for BMI calculation, and completing a reaction test. The students were chosen as volunteers from a sample of convenience based upon the classes that were available to participate in the study. A mentor who is a university teacher, familiar with the self-perception index, and who has performed numerous BMI measurements on children supervised the measurements that were performed for this investigation.<br><br> In each grade, 20 boys and 20 girls were asked to participate. The data was recorded and analyzed using analysis of variance statistical tests. If significant differences were found between the BMI groups or the GPA groups, a post-hoc analysis (Tukey's) was performed to determine where the differences existed. BMI did not have any significant relations to any self-perception domain or to reaction time. However, GPA did relate to five of the self-perception domains. Those domains were scholastic competence, social acceptance, physical appearance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. GPA was not related to athletic competence. The results of this study indicate that body size (BMI) may not cause children psychological discomfort but their academic performance (GPA) is related to their self-perception in a number of areas.

MALE VS. FEMALE: SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM MEMORY OF BABY BOOMERS
Holly Sue Barth, Hannah Elizabeth Reid
Upper Sandusky High School, Upper Sandusky, Ohio, United States

The purpose of this research is to find if there’s a difference between long and short term memory of male and female baby boomers. Baby boomer is the nickname for people born between 1946 - 1964 when soldiers returned home from World War II and started families. Memory is the brain's ability to store or recall events. The brain stores memory in the hippocampus and temporal lobes. The hypothesis is, when presented with a series of words and tested twice, once for short and once for long term memory, males will have better short term memory while females will have better long term memory. Subjects were given a questionnaire asking if they had any memory problems or learning disabilities. They were given twenty words with associated pictures. After two minutes subjects were to write what they could. After finishing the test subjects were shown the list of 20 words again and helped with techniques that make memories become long term. Subjects were tested a week later where they again had to write out words they remembered. They were also given a list of 50 words in which they had to circle the 20 original words. In conclusion, it was found that women overall had better short and long term memory. However, the result of the test with pictures was close. Also, grouping was the most helpful method. As baby boomers get closer to retirement it’s good for society to understand how the memory of this population is staying intact. A statistical analysis was done on the data by conducting a T test for independent samples which proved that the results found are significant.

EXAMINING SOCIAL SKILLS, BEHAVIORAL ADJUSTMENT, AND REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS IN PARENTS AND SIBLINGS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM
Nathalie Fay Tadena, Jessica Palmer
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY, USA

Studies provide evidence that autism is a genetic disorder placing siblings of individuals with autism at a greater risk of developing social deficits and maladaptive behavior. This study examined trends of social impairment, maladaptive behavior, and repetitive behaviors in multiple incidence autism spectrum disorder families. The sample consisted of 88 unaffected (non-autistic) siblings and 72 parents of children with autism and 86 siblings and 46 parents of normally developing children. One parent from each family was administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale to assess the social skills and behavioral adjustment of children, the Personality Questionnaire to assess the respondent’s social skills, and the Personal Need for Structure Scale, to assess level of repetitive behaviors. Results found unaffected siblings of individuals with autism to have less developed social skills (p= .033) and higher levels of repetitive behaviors than siblings of normally developing children (p=.002). No significant differences were found between the behavioral adjustment of unaffected siblings of children with autism and that of siblings in the comparison group (p>.05). In both groups of siblings, there were significant inverse relationships between the development of social skills and maladaptive behavior and between child’s age and development of maladaptive behaviors (p<.05). Parents of children with autism had significantly less developed social skills than parents in the comparison group (p<.012). In autism families only, aspects of children’s socialization skill levels were correlated with socialization levels of fathers (p<.05). In families without a history of autism, children's level of repetitive behaviors was significantly correlated with mothers' and fathers' level of repetitive behaviors respectively (p<.01).

PROGRAMMING AN EMOTION-BASED ORIGINAL MUSIC GENERATOR THROUGH CONVENTIONAL MUSICAL PATTERNS
William Alexander Locke, Jack Murphy
St. Charles West High School, St. Charles, Missouri, United States of America

The first objective of the project detailed is to create a music generator capable of writing original songs based upon standard musical conventions. To this end, a random note generator has been programmed to put out a sequence of notes with random pitch values and durations; this random note generator is then given rules and parameters restricting and patterning its output so that the undefined, almost accidental sounds can be arranged into harmonious, structured, and, ultimately, musical compositions. The random generator ensures the notes are arranged in an original format; the musical parameters ensure that the arrangement conforms to structures of key, meter, and chords.<br><br> The second objective of the project detailed is to determine the music generator's output along certain emotional content. To this end, the rules and the parameters employed by the generator are specified by selected emotional commands: happy, sad, soothing, restless. The emotional command entered will determine the use of certain rules, particularly of key (happy/sad) and meter (soothing/restless).<br><br> This project is tested through the participation of volunteers who listen to a selection of musical pieces generated by this program and complete a survey in which they rate the "listenability" of each piece (determining the effectiveness of the overall musical structure) and the emotional content, if any, they detected in each (determining the effectiveness of the specified emotional commands). The end result is an original music generator capable of writing music with a specific emotional content, as validated through human response.

SYSTEM FOR THE DOWNS
Christopher Steven Lagerlef, Janesh Patel
Clark High School, Plano, Texas, USA

If a child with Downs Syndrome is taught through a visual learning style, they will score the highest on a comprehension test. Using various books, recording devices and testing environments, children were tested to determine which learning method allowed them to achieve the highest score possible, and if a blue background could also increase the score. the results were that using visual aides had the highest success rate of 82% in the normal learning environment. The lowest learning method was the audio with 44%. the blue environment completely enhanced the results. In fact the level of isgnificance between using the blue room versus using the normal room was 99% statistically significant. Not one average in the blue environment was under 75%, with the visual method scoring the highest percentile once again with an average 94%. These reults could very well change the face of schools in the world, leading to an increase in the scores using the blue learning environment. This information could easily lead to a brighter future for the handicapped children of America. Future applications for this information could be using the various learning styles and learning environments and discovering which is the best for non-handicapped children.

FAT FREE? SO YOU THINK!
Hannah Marie Haralson, Clintnisa Broome
Forest Hill High School; Jackson, MS; USA

Our society has been bombarded with media claims concerning fat free foods and the quality of the taste. Every company claims to have the perfect formula that will fool your taste buds. We decided to test some of the claims by conducting our own taste test. To prove that some fat free foods aren't very tasty, we did a study with our classmates, ages 15 to 19 years, using brand named chips, milk, candy, pudding, and yogurt. All of the foods used had a fat free or a low fat counterpart. Our original test involved 10 people who were not blindfolded. We asked the participants to taste each type of food with the fat free or low fat version. We then asked the participants which version of the food was fat free or low fat. We found that 8 out of the 10 people guessed accurately which sample was fat free, proving our original hypothesis. We then wanted to know if the sense of sight played a role in the ability to taste the difference between the fat free and low fat foods. We believed that we would obtain the same results as with the original test. We then blindfolded 50 more people and repeated the test. To our surprise, only 25% of the students we tested were able to taste the difference.<br><br>We found the sense of sight for some people actually does affect their sense of taste.

YOUR HANDS CAN GIVE YOU AWAY
Jade Breanne Northrop, Savannah Kay Croy
Ennis High School Ennis Montana United States 

By observing a person's hand and body gestures, can certain personality traits be revealed, such as being an introvert or extrovert?<br><br><br> Our predictions were that people's gestures give away their personalities. We anticipated people with extroverted personalities would use many hand and body gestures and people who are introverts would use few hand and body gestures.<br><br><br> We used five human subjects for our experiment. First, we gave them an eight-question response form to help us get an idea of their personalities. After that we determined whether they were introverts or extroverts. Next, we asked them a set of seven questions that would require thorough answers. While the subjects answered the questions, we marked a checklist of body and hand gestures the subjects might use during the experiment. The interviews took place in a quiet area to reduce distractions. We recorded all gestures the subject made and also made note when one was used repeatedly. <br><br><br> After the experiment we compared the results of the interview to our predictions to determine if our hypothesis was right. The experiment proved correct. Our subject with the introverted personality did not use many hand or body gestures. The subjects with extroverted personalities always used their hands and told us as much as they possibly could. After going back over our results, we found that one of our subjects displayed both personalities. We came to the conclusion that people can have both introverted and extroverted tendencies; it just depends on their surroundings. <br><br> <br><br>

Nº 4113"Aeronautica Argentina". Colanzuli. Iruya. Salta. Argentina.

Abstract <br><br>The following research has been carried out in the subject called Social Studies, taught in a primary school in a rural area in Iruya, in the province of Salta, Argentina. This town is situated in the Andes, at 3,lOOm aboye sea level, in a Kolla reservation. The region has certain distinctive features because the population has kept their own cultural patterns and values inherited from their ancestors. This is why education has strong family roots. “Colanzuli” mothers play an important role in sociaiizing chiidres, which have conserved and transferred the culture of the ancestors to the new generations . This is the reason why we thought it was important to investigate about their siient and not always recognised job. <br><br>Reflecting on the practices related to children upbringing implies understanding the factors that trigger the social agents that produce such practices within a span of time and a definite context. This work aimed at inquiring, describing and analizing oid upbringing practices, regarding them as sources of wisdom for human growth,in an ecological scope in which all this closely related.We work with the oral sources: grandmothers mothers, healers and professionals who work in the zone. <br><br>

FALLACIES IN COMMUNICATION
Miriam Elizabeth Gomez, Lucas Martin Dolcemascolo
Experimental School #2 "Puertas del Sol", San Luis, Argentina

The research consist in an examination of fallacies found in graphic means of communication in Argentina.<br><br>The problem situation wich served as starting motor for this work is related to the widespread occurrence of fallacies in several daily discourses.<br><br>The hypothesis that conducted this research is the assertion that journalistic articles contain fallacies. Evaluation of this hypothesis was done over a corpus of 81 articles from argentinean graphic mass media characterized as follows: 43 published on Clarín and 38 on Página 12; they all deal with the same news event (settling of foreign debt with the International Monetary Fund) and were published during the same period of time. This corpus was analyzed by contrasting argumentations found with the theory on fallacies systematized by Irving M. Copi in Introduction to Logics.<br><br>After analyzing the gathered data the hypothesis was proved and showed a high percentage of fallacies’ occurrence in both papers. A comparative analysis of the situation in each means studied was also possible. In this sense, differences were discovered regarding: the type of fallacies prevailing in each newspaper and discourse (the journalists’ or another person’s) in which fallacies are included.<br><br>As immediate projection of the results, the interference that occurrence of fallacies entail in due fulfillment of means of communication’s ethical responsibilities was evaluated. This is the reason why the main contribution of this research is to urge reflection on the adequate handling of information by the media and on the need of a more critical positioning by the readers. <br><br>

BRAIN LATERALIZATION: GETTING A HAND ON LEARNING AND HOW THE BRAIN WORKS
Katy Fay Schramm, Abbielee Gardner
Academy for Math, Engineering & Science, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

In this study, possible connections between cognitive abilities and hemispheric dominance were tested. Two questions were considered:<br><br>o Can tests be created and used to classify individuals as “left” or “right” brain dominant?<br><br>o Do math, reading and visual learning abilities differ according to which side of the brain dominates? <br><br>It was hypothesized that the mathematical, reading and visual reasoning skills of students differ according to the dominant cerebral hemisphere.<br><br>Two experiments were performed, one at the Academy for Math, Engineering & Science (AMES), and the other at a local College. Forty-one subjects, ages 15 to 18, participated in the AMES study. Twenty-nine subjects, ages 18 and older participated in the study involving college students. Test results were compared to a Right Brain Dominance questionnaire (RBD), which was used to scale preference for the right hemisphere. Regression analysis and Pearson Correlation tests were used to compare tests results and RBD scores. Testing materials were modified and improved to pursue testing on college age subjects, which were considered more reliable. For these data, there were no correlations between math, reading and optical illusion test scores compared to RBD scores. A tangram activity was added to enhance visual testing. These data support a correlation between visual abilities and RBD scores. RBD scores tended to increase in subjects with faster Tangram completion scores (P<0.05). Data also showed an increase in RBD scores when subject’s data were grouped by the number of tangrams solved (0, 1, 2, 3+) (P<0.01).<br><br>

This project begins in 2006, starting off of the necessity to inform about the risks that the inadequate treatment of the pathogenic dusts carries. The central problem is that the population of Victorica doesn’t recognize like pathogens dusts certain remainders that it generates. The local homes are generators of pathogenic dusts, and they don’t know the danger of his incorrect classification.<br><br>Methodology: <br><br>Domiciliary surveys to 25% of the local population. Analysis of specific bibliography.<br><br>Interviews to health professionals. Presentation the project to the Honorable Deliberative Council of Victorica and agreements with Municipal Authorities. <br><br>Implementation of a pilot program of differentiated harvesting in two districts of Victorica.<br><br>Pathogenic remainders containers at schools.<br><br>Aid: Clean Gardens = Healthful Life<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br> The objectives of the project have been fulfilled, since the population of Victorica has begun to question the methods used for the elimination of its own remainders. <br><br>Useful strategies of diffusion of the problem are being managed. <br><br>The implementation of a program pilot of harvesting differentiated from remainders in two districts of Victorica has allowed advancing in the improvement of the conditions in which these remainders are gathered together. <br><br>The municipal ordinance number 1173/06, sanctioned on November of 2006 in Victorica, respect to the manipulation, treatment and deposition of pathogenic remainders is based on this project.<br><br>

Municipal School No.1 Catamarca Capital Argentina

The investigation is centered in the commercial development and the regional integration through the San Francisco's Pass located in the mountain range of the Andes county of Catamarca, which meant a transcendent impact for the north region of Argentina and Chile. <br><br>The present work has these objectives: Exchange opinions about the importance of the San Francisco’s Pass with the social main characters involved in the thematic that join us (Govern, Private sector and Population of our county and of the Republic Argentina),know the strategic reasons that give power to the use of the San Francisco’s Pass, spread at local, regional, national and international level the advantages that this cordilleran pass has with regard to other passes located to the north and south of Argentina. <br><br>The hypothesis of work maintains that the San Francisco’s Pass will allow the regional integration and the economical ascent of the macro region ATACALAR and it will compete with aspirations of supremacy over other cordilleran passes located in the north and south of Argentina, keeping in mind the strategic reasons that give power to its use. <br><br>After these considerations we conclude: The international San Francisco’s Pass states a way to a structural change of the macro region ATACALAR with the incorporations of the Argentinian counties of Córdoba, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán y Santa Fe. This pass represents the key for the integration and the development of the ZICOSUR (Zone of integration of the south cone), admitting its advantages in relations to other geographical regions.<br><br>

THE STUDY OF INFANT COGNITION AND ITS EFFECT ON "THEORY OF MIND"
Anisha Zaman, My Nguyen, Cherie Noymany
Dunbar High School, Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America

The purpose of this study was to research infant cognition and its effect on “Theory of Mind”. Most people believe babies from 1 to 12 months don’t have good cognition and high perception yet; it is assumed that infants’ brain development will not allow it to be similar to that of adults. This experiment will allow people to understand the many similarities between adults and infants, by testing their reactions towards common objects and actions. <br><br>Twenty infants were observed and tested; 10 of which were males and the other 10, females. The experiment was taken place in an undisturbed room. The infants were sat on adults’ laps, ones they were comfortable with, and were shown five objects and five actions. Each of the displays were shown for 2 minutes and were displayed a foot away from the infant. The objects were placed on the floor, while each action was performed by the experimenter. All observations and the time of the infant’s period of distraction and attention were recorded. Once finished, the procedures were repeated with other infants. <br><br>The overall average number of seconds focused for the objects and actions were higher than the number of seconds distracted. The objects and actions that they did focus on were of the “Theory of Mind” group. All observations and results showed that infants DO share common reactions to common objects and actions as do adults. Thus, the experiment was successful and contributes to other infant cognitive studies in the world.

STEREOTYPES FROM YOUNG TO OLD
Meghan Sophia Luther, Veronika Biskis
H.P. Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii

Stereotypes From Young to Old <br><br>The purpose of continuing our project was to determine if middle aged to senior citizens of Hawaii possessed stereotypes. Not only stereotypes, but also, those in common with that of the younger generation (second graders). In last year’s project, we discovered that stereotypes had formed in the minds of children as young as second grade. We hope to be able to discover if common stereotypes are being passed down through generations. We realize that the senior citizens, having gone through life, have obtained their own opinions as well as that of those around them. They have created stereotypes, and been stereotyped against. <br><br>After examining our results, we realized that multiple stereotypes seem to share a common result. These areas include, “Who robbed a bank”, “Who has the cooking pot?” and in “Who has the gun?” However, in other areas, senior citizens were stereotyped when second graders were not, most likely due to more maturity. For example, in terms of marital status, the children weren’t as understanding as those who had already gone through marriage itself. Even throughout the mental differences, there were far too many similarities to be just a coincidence. Gerome Kagan said in the Harvard Education letter in 1998, "telling parents they have little influence on their children, is like declaring on a foggy September morning that all the trees have disappeared because you cannot see them."<br><br>

A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DISPOSITIONS IN TEENAGE AFFFINITY AND PHYSICAL INTIMACY INSPIRED BY SOCIOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DISPARITIES
Stephen Harper Odanovich, Ian Maya Panchevre
Tom C. Clark High School, San Antonio TX, USA

Darwinian theory argues that the most defining characteristics of a person are their attitudes towards love, family, attraction, and physical intimacy. A project which seeks to capture the correlation between the identity of a person and their attitude to the aforementioned would help shed light on the behavior of people and their societies. This project surveyed 6096 teenagers through an online survey. Prior to the survey there was a request for parental consent. The study was blind and maintained confidentiality by not asking any identifying information. The participants were categorized in eight different ways: age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, wealth, religion, and social/political views. They were then asked questions which addressed the aforementioned areas. Statistical analysis showed various correlations. The results confirmed the hypothesis regarding age, gender, and sexuality. The older the subject, the more comfortable he/she becomes with sexual activity. Men are more driven by sexual desires whereas women are more driven by familial desires. Homosexuals desired popularity and family less than heterosexuals. Furthermore, Hispanics and Blacks had a strong sense of family unity. It was found that the wealthier desired qualities that could be used in further pursuit of wealth. In regards to religious, social, and political views a dichotomy between liberalism and conservatism became clear. Though the results varied, it was clear that views are influenced by sociological and biological identity, which not only further identifies the population but also makes it possible to predict the future course of societies.

A STUDY IN CROWD MODELING UTILIZING REAL-WORLD DATA TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC FLOW SIMULATIONS
Adam Kidder, Nicholas Triantafillou
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI, USA

One of the many applications of computer modeling is pedestrian traffic flow. There are two major model types used in modeling pedestrian crowds: the field-force model and the social-force model. Both model types have advantages and disadvantages. This project describes the construction of a novel hybrid model combining both approaches, magnifying the advantages of each model type while diminishing the disadvantages.<br><br> The goal of this project was to build an accurate crowd model that could be tested against real-world data for accuracy. Real-world data was collected using a ceiling mounted camera in a public school, and was compared to data generated by the model using a variety of quantitative and qualitative measurements.<br><br> Results indicated this model’s viability. The model demonstrated many features evident in real-world crowds, such as emergent lane formation and realistic clumping distribution among agents. Quantitative data indicated that the model exhibited characteristics evident in actual crowds as well. As found in the real-world data, the hybrid model expressed the cyclic pattern in number of agents, as well as a considerable decrease in speed of agents after a high increase in density. Agent clumping was also observed.<br><br> The engineering goals of this project were completely realized. Through adjustment of the model using data from real-world crowd simulations, the model was improved until holistic crowd trends were reproduced. The resulting data supports the viability of this novel, hybrid social-field force model in pedestrian crowd situations.<br><br>

NO CHILD LEFT CHALLENGED THE EFFECT OF THE AMOUNT OF FORMAL EDUCATION ON SOL SCORES
Bridget Kelly Little, Mary McClellan
Potomac Senior High School, Dumfries, Virginia, United States of America

This project in its present form is the result of the evaluation of the amount of formal education of ninth graders on their ability to interpret the eleventh-grade English Standards of Learning test. The initial idea was to determine if ninth graders could pass the SOL because of the Virginia standards that require teaching to the test. An overall pass rate would have indicated that students are taught the subject matter beforehand and are capable of higher standards.<br><br>The English End of Course Writing Exam from 2005 was obtained and distributed to 267 ninth graders in Prince William County high schools. There was no differentiation between socioeconomic class, ethnicity, or skill level. To ensure objective grading, the tests were scored by a scantron machine and given a score of pass or fail based on a standard scoring rubric. The resulting 73 percent pass rate was only 12 percent lower than the Virginia’s public school’s official pass rate for 2005, as obtained from the Virginia Department of Education.<br><br>The contributions of this project are applicable in demonstrating the uselessness of standardized tests. The ninth graders that passed the SOL now have three unnecessary years of English education ahead of them. This indicates that there needs to be a greater number of bench mark tests or another way to evaluate students’ abilities. The SOL is due to come up for review in the year 2011; hopefully this project will be a precursor to the changes that need to be made.<br><br>

Anemia is a disease which makes itself evident with a decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood what implies a dangerous decrease in the amount of red blood cells. <br><br>Our survey is centered in analyzing whether children in school age, between 5 and 7 years old, suffer from iron deficiency anemia and then evaluate the same group after giving them oral doses of iron.<br><br>- To determine any existing relationship between this disease and parasitism.<br><br>- To develop an awareness of the importance of a well-balanced diet in the affected children’s mothers. <br><br>- To compare these children with another group belonging to a different social background..<br><br>All this directed to establish the level of incidence of anemia in children’s schooling and learning. <br><br>We used several datas done by professionals (laboratory, clinical, psycho motive and of cognitive capability).<br><br>This disease does not only affect the individual but the whole society, as human capital is the main richness of a country and if it is damaged, the possibility of growing as a country in the near future also weakens. <br><br>The best way of fighting against this disease is basically to provide those people suffering from it with an adequate diet consisting of red meat and vegetables, and organizing health campaigns accompanied by policies which ensure everybody an equal access to health services.<br><br>

ACCIDENTAL COLOR
Raymundo Navarrete, Prido Polanco
Bisbee High School, Bisbee Arizona, United States

This project is designed to test how humans react to different colors, and if those reactions could increase or decrease our chances of getting in an accident. A computer program was used to test the reaction time of certain students to different colors. The computer program suddenly changed a background color into a different one in a computer monitor and measured the time it took each student to press a mouse key once the change was made. The reaction time procedure was repeated a number of 576 times during the experiment. <br><br>It was found that the color with the fastest reaction time is white. Hot Colors tend to have faster reaction times than Cold Colors. An interesting pattern found is between the gray-scale colors. If arranged from darker to lighter in a reaction time vs. color graph, a sine wave that passes through these colors is represented. The sine curve reappears when colors are graphed. If the color circle order is use (blue, purple, red, orange, yellow, green; repeats), then a whole repetition of the sine curve is found in the color-reaction time graph.<br><br>The contributions of this project can be really benefitial in the future. If more experimentation is done, the exact mathematical sine curve that explains how each individual reacts to different colors can be establish. This will not only help us to chose a safer car color, but could be used in other fields were color distinction and fast reaction times are require.<br><br>

THINK AUTISM
Lawanya Jeyaselvan
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL

The purpose of this project is to examine 3 sensory integration activities and the Picture Exchange Communication System on children with Autism who suffer from sensory and speech impairment. The hypothesis of this project is that jumping on a trampoline prior to completing a task provides sensory input that will better help the child concentrate and perform the task versus swinging on a swing or jumping on an exercise ball and the child will have an increase in attempts to use the Picture Exchange Communication System and will develop speech skills over time. Following each sensory session each child performed the same activity. For example after jumping on the trampoline all 25 kids performed the same activity, which was stringing 5 beads. Each child had seven day intervals for all three sensory integration sessions, for the first seven days the children would jump on the trampoline, on the second set the children would swing on a swing, and for the final set of seven days the child would jump on an exercise ball. In Conclusion the scientist’s hypothesis was correct jumping on a trampoline is the best vestibular sensory activity to help children with autism concentrate more efficiently and perform better with the Picture Exchange Communication system. The scientist noticed that after each child jumped on the trampoline the children had less stems with their hands, thus without this extra hand motion they were able to complete the task at a more appropriate pace. The child also performed more efficiently and correlated pictures with what they desired.

Strategies to increase survival for victims of acute cardiac events include increased use of public access defibrillation through the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in communities. This study investigated layperson’s willingness and ability to use an AED. To analyze willingness to use the device, a self-created 9 question survey was administered to 100 subjects. Survey questions included willingness to use an AED on a family member vs. a stranger; how training in AED use effects willingness; and subject identifiers such as age, gender, educational level, and medical environment exposure. To analyze ability, 20 subjects identified as having no familiarity with the device were asked to participate in a simulated emergency situation necessitating use of a training AED on a mannequin. Appropriate use was scored using American Heart guidelines (turn on device; apply pads properly; plug in leads; shock when indicated; stay clear during shock). The study concluded that layperson’s with AED training will be more willing to use the device than those without training; older subjects expressed more willingness to use an AED on a family member than younger subjects; and subjects with higher levels of education had more knowledge of the device. Sixty percent of layperson subjects in the simulation exercise appropriately used the AED. Pad placement presented the greatest confusion for subjects. With minimal public advertisement targeting AED awareness and use, I believe a large population of layperson’s could be willing and able to use AEDs on victims of acute cardiac events in the community.

BODY LANGUAGE
Trevor Gerard Simon Jr.
St. James Parish Science and Math Academy, Vacherie, LA

This experiment proposed the following questions: Is body language and the type of personality of a person directly related? Which type of personality uses more body langue? Are there any specific gestures that one personality type expresses more than the other? For this test, I used; 30 Human test subjects, a digital stop watch, and a steady interviewing environment. I began this study by creating a questionnaire and a set of interview questions. Each subject received the questionnaire and completed it thoroughly. Next, subjects participate in an interview. Seven questions were asked, which demanded thorough explanation. All subjects were led to believe that his or her responses were being recorded; however the questioner only recorded the approximate times of each interview with the subject, and the amount of hand and body gestures each performed during the interview. A list of common hand and body gestures was created and used to minimize recording time. To relieve pressure on the interviewee, the stop watch and the check list were hidden. This created a false environment to keep results steady. A quiet area was used in the interviewing process to keep distractions to a minimum. After the interview was over, the results from test one were compared to the results from test two in order to determine if personality and talkativeness influenced the frequency and variety of gestures.

READING FLUENCY AND COMPREHENSION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN BLOCK AND FORMATTED TEXT
Lindsey Brooke Saunders
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what effects unformatted text and formatted text passages have on comprehension and reading fluency rates. A group of 20 second graders was chosen. The students were divided into Test Group A and Test Group B, with each group consisting of five boys and five girls. Ten second grade reading level passages were used for each test group. The passages were typed using a different format from the original. The first five passages were typed with justified margins and single spaced lines. The second five were formatted by breaking down the sentences into segments of no more than 30 characters per line. Varied line indentions were used for the beginning of each line. Comprehension questions were made up for each of the reading passages using FCAT style question stems. The 10 students were tested on reading fluency for one minute on each passage. Each student read aloud until the passage was completed. They were then given a comprehension test on the passage read. The results for the first test group showed that the students' reading fluency rate increased an average of 16 words a minute when reading from formatted text passages. Comprehension test scores increased by 3% for the same text. The second test group showed an average increase in reading fluency of seven words a minute when reading from formatted text passages. Comprehension increased 11% for the same text. From these results it can be concluded that using a formatted text pattern in reading passages increases reading fluency rates and comprehension test scores.

A STUDY OF VARYING HARMONIC SPECTRUM EXPOSURE ON STUDENTS' CONCENTRATION DURING SPATIAL REASONING EXAMINATION AS ASSESSED VIA FOURIER ANALYSES
Vivian Alice Lee
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park, TX

When a human hears a single note of a musical instrument, he may not realize that he is not only hearing one frequency, but an overlapping matrix of many overtones ("harmonics"), which can be separated from the initial waveform via application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which splits the time-domain sound wave into many frequency-domain bars indicating apparent strength of the harmonic(s). In this study, this principle was used to analyze the effects of exposure to various waveforms with different harmonic spectra on students' concentration levels (see equation below). 60+ students were given different versions of a series of nine spatial reasoning tests for a total sample size (N) of 460, each with a randomized sequence of questions from a test bank of 90. The students listened to a randomized selection of waveforms while answering the questions. Their results were assessed using this formula: (% accuracy * 05) + (((180-time)/180) * 100 * 0.5) = Concentration Index ("CIndex"); the higher the index the better. From the data collected, it can be observed that the oboe and bassoon's waveforms augmented the concentration of students greatest. Waveform imaging and the FFT were used to analyze these results: instruments with sawtooth-shaped waveforms, both even and odd harmonics, and closed conical bores were most beneficial to students' concentration. Those with square-shaped waves, only odd harmonics, and closed cylindrical bores (producing only odd harmonics due to presence of a node at one end and antinode at the other) were least beneficial, perhaps because they lack the full harmonic spectrum present in those most beneficial. A one-way analysis of variance on the CIndex data for all waveforms generated a p-value of 0.0064.

THE IMPACT OF MUSIC ON STUDENTS' TEST SCORES
Christie-Brianna K Momohara
Kailua High School, Kailua, HI

One could assume music is a big part of life, no matter which generation one comes from. At Kailua High School however, any type of listening device isn't allowed to be used during class time. This causes one to question whether music truly does impair students' learning and performance abilities. If it's true that people are capable of focusing their conscious awareness on a particular stimulus and they're able to multitask efficiently, then one could infer that music will not cause a student to perform poorly on a test. In order to carry out this experiement, high school students were randomly selected and randomly placed into two separate groups-the control and experimental group. The control group took two tests and studied in between without listening to music, while the experimental group did the same except they listened to music of their choosing. Cautious procedures were taken to avoid any conflict with students' moral, religious, or ethical beliefs. By conducting this experiment, findings indicate that music does not negatively impact students' test scores. Students who listened to music while studying and taking a test did (on average) just a well as those who didn't listen to music. Thus, there is no reason why students are not able to use listening devices during non-lecture class times. People are able to consciously select what to focus on and can complete tasks of two different stimuli at once just as efficiently if they were to do them separately.

ANOREXIA AND BULIMIA: IN TEEN ATHLETES
Sasha Alixer Spalding
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

The purpose of thee experiment is to see how much information athletes know about Anorexia and Bulimia versus non-athletes. The reason for doing this project is to see if the knowledge of the disorder affects the amount of athletes versus non-athletes with the disorder. It was also hypothesized that athletes knew less about the disorder.<br><br>The procedure involved having teachers pass out the surveys with the consent forms attached. Subjects were informed that everything was strictly confidential. <br><br>When the results were tallied they showed that athletes and Non-athletes had many of the same answers except for minor differences. Such as question 2 which is about is anorexia and bulimia more common in females or males. Also question6 which ask are there any major health risk involved with anorexia and bulimia. These two questions had almost 100% the same answer except for one person. The one question that had a lot of variety was question 9 asking how does anorexia affect children’s school work. This question had opposite answers more athletes chose choice A while more non-athletes chose choice B. <br><br>Based on the results not enough information to determine which group had better knowledge overall. The answers to the surveys were too close to distinguish a difference between athletes and non-athletes regarding anorexia and bulimia. It appears this study can benefit from further research. It also suggests that both groups could benefit from further education regarding eating disorders.

STEREOTYPES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Shannon Lee Biagi
Eau Gallie High School, Melbourne, FL

This experiment sought to identify the major source of criminal stereotyping in modern day society. When an individual reads about a crime, they create a mental picture of the suspect. More often than not, what they see is not the most likely criminal, but a stereotype that is rooted in the identifier's background.<br><br> A private internet-based survey was created, which consisted of 20 hypothetical crime scenarios ranging from speeding and petty theft to bombing and hijacking. Participants were given an unlimited amount of time to read the scenarios one at a time, and when done, were given 7 seconds to choose who they believed was the criminal from a lineup of six mug shots. Using information gathered from a questionnaire taken beforehand, commonalities between the participant's backgrounds and responses were analyzed. <br><br> It was found that an individual's gender and military relationship had no affect on the amount of stereotypical responses received, age had an inconsistent effect, and amount of television watched per week had strong influences on an individual's bias. Participants who watched zero to nine hours of television per week gave 153 correct (statistically valid) responses and 135 incorrect (stereotypical) responses. Those who watched ten to nineteen hours of television per week gave 124 correct and 128 incorrect responses. Startlingly, participants who watched twenty or more hours of television per week only gave 118 correct and 164 incorrect responses. <br><br> This experiment demonstrates that first impressions may be tragically wrong, influenced by factors an individual has the ability to control.

WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S OUT: HIGH SCHOOLERS' PERCEPTIONS OF COOLNESS
Shelby Marie Raye
Manatee High School, Bradenton, FL

What qualities does a “cool” teenager possess? Teenagers tend to judge their peers on how cool they are. The purpose of this study is to find out what traits make a teenager “cool” to his/her peers. Data from this study can be used by school administrators, teachers, and parents to fully understand why teenagers may exhibit certain behaviors. How cool a teenager is taps into 5 different domains: athletics, academics, social relationships, personal qualities, and deviant behaviors. If teenagers are surveyed on what they believe the qualities of a “cool” teenager are, then appearance and personality traits will appear to be the most important qualities of a “cool” teenager.<br><br> <br><br>To determine what qualities teenagers believe a "cool" teenager possesses, 389 students at a large high school were surveyed. The survey was designed specifically for this study. The most common responses of the survey were compared between male and female responses. The surveys were also compared by age, ranging from 14-years-old to 18-years-old.<br><br>Significant results were found regarding the qualities that make a teenager cool. Both male and female teenagers indicated that participating in athletics was cool. Almost half of the participants agreed that GPA does not pertain to coolness. Males rated funny as the most likely positive trait of a cool teenager and females rated outgoing. It was also found that 17-year-olds thought it was cooler to drink alcohol and take part in risky behaviors than any other age group. The perceptions of what qualities a cool teenager possesses differed and agreed across gender and age.

THE CHRONIC EFFECTS OF GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND LEVELS OF DAYTIME DROWSINESS
Michael Andrew Fairchild Harding
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The experiment was designed to determine the effects of growth hormone on quality of life and daytime sleepiness. This was achieved by first measuring the blood serum levels of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1, the marker protein of Growth Hormone. The patients were given the Epworth sleepiness scale and the HR Quality of Life Scale during routine visits with their health care providers. The results of the experiment did support the hypothesis; that if the blood serum concentration of biological marker of Growth Hormone, Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1, is at least two-thirds of a standard deviation below the median of the population for an experimental group, then their quality of life shall be lower than that of a control group, and their daytime sleepiness shall be higher than that of the control group. The results of the experiment showed that the control group having the experimental mean of 10.642+/-8.482 HRQoL score points, 9.785+/-5.833 Epworth sleepiness score points, and 41.6+/-23.9 Harding Overall QoL score points while the control group had the experimental mean of 1.857+/-3.485 HRQoL score points, 5.714+/-2.498 Epworth sleepiness score points, and 15.6+/-9.3 Harding Overall QoL score points. The null hypothesis of N0 treatment effect is supported because the P-Value of N1 is P¡Ý0.0064 for the combined Harding overall QoL score, a P¡Ý0.0086 for the HRQoL score, and a P¡Ý0.048 for the Epworth sleepiness score.

COLOR ME HAPPY: THE EFFECTS OF COLOR ON MEMORIZATION TASKS
Stratton Elizabeth Haywood
Holy Savior Menard Central High School, Alexandria, LA

This project was designed to determine the effect of color on sensory input, specifically if color can help students with memorization tasks. This idea was developed after hearing a teacher’s concern that her students were having trouble memorizing vocabulary. The hypothesis is that colored paper does not affect student memory. <br><br> A total of 80 fifth and sixth grade students, all performing below grade level, were chosen to participate in the study. Five lists of 15 words chosen from second and third grade spelling books were printed on five different colors of paper, including white. The students memorized the words on one color of paper and recorded as many words possible on a sheet of white loose-leaf paper. This process was repeated for each color of paper.<br><br> Overall, students performed similarly using both white and colored paper. However, the fifth graders scored 11.2% higher using pale green paper than with any other color, while the sixth grade class scored 8.2% lower using pale green paper. This is noteworthy because on all types of paper, except pale green, the sixth graders scored higher than the fifth graders.<br><br> The results have raised several questions that will be addressed in future research: 1) Why is there such a discrepancy in scores using pale green paper? 2) Would allowing students to record words on the same color of paper from which they were memorized increase scores? 3) What is the ideal color to aid memorization, and is it different for different ages?

IS A PICTURE WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS?
Sarah Beatrice Bellingham
Santa Catalina School, Monterey, CA

The ability to memorize new words is key to learning a new language. This study tests how a person’s memorization skills depend on the presentation of new material. Studies have suggested that different teaching methods must be used to teach different language students, for example, teaching using pictures versus teaching using words. This was tested in this experiment by using two sets of flashcards on a test group of students in order to compare two methods of memorization. One set had a word in English on one side and the same word translated into a foreign language on the other side. The second set of flashcards had a picture representing an object on one side and a word in a foreign language on the other side. My subjects came from the 3rd through 6th grade classes of All Saints’ Episcopal Day School, and their ages ranged from 8-12 years old. A total of 76 students were tested in all. My results showed a large degree of variability in the performance of my subject group, although some trends are clear, for example improved performance with age. Neither picture nor word flashcards could be considered the “best” method of teaching for all students, as 53% of the students scored higher using words, 39% scored higher using pictures, and 8% scored the same on both tests. However, the results also show that some students performed much better with either picture or word associations. This suggests that the optimal sort of teaching styles varies depending on the individual.

ALGEBRA: NOT THE SAME OLD GAME
Neil Martin Redfield
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Educational computer games claim to teach effectively. There has never been a long-term study to rate how effective they are. In Part I of this study (2006-2007), an educational mathematics game significantly (p<0.05) raised student test scores over a five week period. The purpose of this experiment was to compare the effectiveness of the same computer game (Math Blaster Algebra, comprehensive for Algebra I) over a five week versus a fifteen week period and to determine if student performance and attitudes towards math improved. <br><br> Fifty students participated in this second-year study. At the start of the experiment, students took a test rating their current knowledge of Algebra I and a survey quantifying their attitudes towards math. Twenty-three students were given a copy of the game to play at home and a sheet to record their playing times over 15 weeks. A performance test was given after the students had played for 5 weeks and again after 15 weeks. An attitude survey was administered at 15 weeks. Test scores were compared using paired t-tests, and r2 values were derived comparing the length of time played versus changes in test and classroom performance. Student performance at 5 weeks did improve but not significantly so. No significant variations were noted at 15 weeks. No changes in student attitude were apparent. Combined 5 week data from both years indicated a significant improvement in test scores (8%). The results suggest a five-week playing time was beneficial but that no further improvements occurred after 15 weeks.

COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT AND MATH CLASS PLACEMENT
Annalee Grace Beaver
Perham High School, Perham, MN

In many schools today students are placed into two different categories when placed into math classes: advanced and non-advanced. This study was done to see if cognitive development of students in advanced math classes was more formal than students in non-advanced math classes. It was hypothesized that the people in advanced math classes think more formally than those who are not. An evaluation test to determine a student’s level of thinking called the Karplus, Lawson, and Renner cognitive development placement test, based on Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, was obtained and distributed to eight classes of 9th and 10th grade students. The data was gathered, coded to protect identity, and analyzed. Each of the student’s answers to the different puzzles in the test was analyzed and the student was placed into one of the following groups: pre-operational, concrete, transitional, or formal. It was concluded that students in advanced math classes are at a higher level of cognitive development than students in traditional math classes.

CROWDING-OUT OR CROWDING-IN: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES?
Xiaomeng Zeng
West High School, Iowa City, IA

There has been an ongoing debate in the public library community over raising private donations to fight budget crunches. Some fear that an influx of private funds might result in losses of government support – the crowding-out effect, while others argue the opposite – the crowding-in effect. This debate is also theoretically linked to theories of pro-social behavior, and no previous research has examined this issue. The critical question is: do public funding for and private contributions to public libraries crowd out each other? In line with the impure altruism theory and the traditional concern of librarians, I hypothesized that there will be a crowding-out effect in both directions.<br><br>To test this hypothesis, I obtained and processed the 2000 U.S Census data for Iowa and data from the Iowa Public Library Statistics, containing information from more than 500 public libraries in Iowa from years 2000 to 2006. I then constructed statistical models that include government funding, private donations, city population, median age, household income, education level, and Friends groups. I found, contrary to my hypothesis, a crowding-in, rather than a crowding-out, effect in both directions: an increase in public funding is associated with an increase in private donations, and vice versa. This indicates that, in this case, the impure altruism theory is not supported. Instead, I suggest that both the government and private donors conditionally cooperate with each other and perceive each others’ financial contributions to the public library as positive signals to continue support, resulting in this observed crowding-in effect.

THE ABILITY TO LEARN: LEARNING AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COMET GOLDFISH
Kaleigh Anne Eichel
Strongsville Sr High School, Strongsville, OH

This project examines whether goldfish have the ability to learn to perform a simple task and then transfer this learned information to unlearned members of the same species.<br><br> Firstly, the largest goldfish from a group of five was separated into an isolated aquarium with identical environmental conditions. The environment was then altered through the introduction of a maze and the lone goldfish was trained to swim through the maze using food as a stimulus and positive reinforcement in operant conditioning. The fish was able to successfully complete the maze in an average time of thirty-two seconds. <br><br> Secondly, two fish were randomly selecting from the original group and introduced into the aquarium of the trained fish. Without a stimulus from human intervention, the newly introduced fish partially learned the maze through the deliberate actions of the trained fish. The larger trained fish would repeatedly swim forward and backward through the opening of the maze to encourage the others to follow its behavior and it would coral the others towards the maze opening.<br><br> Thirdly, the two fish were removed and a new untrained fish was introduced into to the aquarium of the trained fish. This case found that the transfer of learning was more pronounced for a single unlearned fish compared to two unlearned fish.<br><br> This project found that fish learn through mimicking the behavior of a learned fish and that there is a tendency of the learned fished to actively influence the learning of the unlearned fish.

IS IT SAFE TO DISH AND DRIVE? THE EFFECT OF CELL PHONE USAGE ON REACTION TIME
Amelia Joann Eads
Blevins Junior High School, Fort Collins, CO

The problem I am trying to solve is whether the usage of a cellular phone affects a person’s reaction time.<br><br> To decipher the answer to my question I first found a reaction time test online. I then proceeded to find a video of traffic online that was used for visual stimulation. In addition, I wrote a list of simple questions and acquired two cell phones. To test one of my volunteers I first had them take the reaction time test without the use of a cell phone, though the visual stimulation of the video was present. This acted as my control and the average time was taken from five trials. After recording those results I then had my assistant call my volunteer on a cell phone. The volunteer then proceed to repeat the reaction time test while talking to my assistant on the cellular phone. In this second experiment the visual stimulation of the video was still present, and five trials were also taken. To assure that my volunteer was paying attention to the “conversation” in the second test, my assistant asked them the simple questions while talking on the phone to my volunteer.<br><br> The results of my data agreed with the opinion of my hypothesis. It was evident in my results that the use of a cell phone does increase a person’s reaction time.

AIM TO WRITE
Taylor Hanna Fitch
Belton-Honea Path High School, Honea Path, SC

The purpose of this investigation is to discover whether or not a child's accuracy at hitting a target has a direct correlation to his handwriting skills. I predicted that a child's hand-eye coordination could give the examiner some direct insight to how the child could complete a handwriting task.<br><br>Handwriting is an activity that each of us uses everyday. In order to achieve high-quality handwriting, several elements must be present. Visual acuity is key to the success of both handwriting and well-developed hand-eye coordination. Visual acuity includes: visual fixation, accommodation (focusing), convergence (eye aiming), binocularity (eye teaming), and the overall eye movement ability. If each of these components is functioning correctly, the child will develop good hand-eye coordination and be able to achieve higher handwriting scores. If any one of these components is off, it could drastically hinder the child and his ability to succeed. <br><br>To prove this theory, children from grades K3 through first grade were asked to hit a target at a distance of ten feet with10 beanbags. The number of accurate hits was recorded. Each child was then asked to write a word or phrase. Their handwriting was reviewed by the examiner with pre-set criteria. A handwriting score was given. The child's accuracy and handwriting score were compared. The results of this comparison revealed that the hypothesis was indeed correct. Thus, these results could be used to encourage teachers to use a new teaching method involving hand –eye coordination activities.

WALKING STICK FOR VISUAL-DISABLED PEOPLE AGAINST AIR CRASHES
Jessica Silva Silveira
Colegio Fundacao Bradesco - Gravatai, Gravatai-RS, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

After a conversation, an interview, with a visual disabled person about the difficulties he finds every day, I discovered that one of the most frequent problems is when the person is moving in a sidewalk, that he still does not know, and face obstacles that are above the ground, in the air, such as branches of trees and public telephones. <br><br> <br><br>So I dedicated my research and studies trying to find alternatives that would minimize this problem. Then I had the idea of a special walking stick, which could help to prevent such shocks. That's why I created a prototype of a walking stick to help the visual disabled people, facilitating their displacement and access to the world and with easy handling, without electronic components and with a low cost. This walking stick should avoid the shocks with air objects (at the height of the head) that a common walking stick is unable to detect.<br><br> <br><br>My prototype is very simple, is a regular walking stick increased by a shaft of VHF antenna, designed for front and up until the size of the head of the person. In the presence of an air obstacle, it would sense a tremor of the walking stick due to the antenna, preventing the collision. <br><br> <br><br>I hope that this prototype developed in my project could be implemented and that could be part of the daily life of this group of people, improving and facilitating their living conditions.

PREPRO: PROSPECTING EMPRENEURS, A SOCIAL INCLUSION PROPOSAL THROUGH ENTERPRISING EDUCATION
Camila Dahmer
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The project aims at characterizing an experience of enterprising education, as well, the steps to plan and build a company, developing skills and competences that could not be reached through regular processes of the school subjects, such as the developing of enterprising spirit, the ability of working and planning in group, creativity, innovation, organization sense, among other capacities and professional skills that are currently valorized at the market and that also contributes to the formation of the citizen and to the social inclusion.<br><br> To accomplish the project, data has been raised through bibliographic researches and interviews about the meaning and the importance of developing enterprising practices at schools and also, analyzing the experiences that have been carried on. The results showed that this concept improves students’ qualification, as citizens and as professionals, favoring the development of the competences to life, as a political man, able to interfere in the social reality, improving people’s life quality and allowing the students insertion in the market.<br><br> It has been concluded that this project does not finish with this study, but it is ratified that the evidences raised, allied to font-people and to the analyzed experiences, allowed the elaboration of a proposal of enterprising education to schools. It is believed that the built experience may be extended as a suggestion to other schools, as an initial methodological proposal, aiming at qualifying the student as a citizen and as a professional, favoring the social insertion.

THE AUDIOVISUAL INFLUENCE TO THE SOCIAL EXCLUSION: USING THE AUDIOVISUAL RESOURCES AS AN EDUCATIONAL INSTRUMENT
Guilherme Antwarg
Escola Brasileira Israelita Chaim Nachman Bialik, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

A very common criticism is that the school being a learning institution and space for the construction of knowledge, shouldn’t allow audio-visual means such as television and cinema assume a role as a shaping tool for young individuals. However, we can’t deny the fact that the audio-visual Medias have influence over individuals in general. The school would be denying the reality in which young people live considering the audio-visual society in which we live. This type of Media reflects as the main reference which young people have to form their way of understanding the world.<br><br>Admitting the role of cinematographic pieces (the main focus of our theme) as source of historic knowledge (due to it’s production context), may be used as an educational instrument, if the school knows how to use it, and may guarantee that the student will be able to absorb the context and take a standpoint from what is displayed. This may guarantee that the student insert himself as a member of society, since he is instinctively discriminating due to his capitalist system.<br><br>The goal of this report is to verify the existence of a new category of exclusion based on the fact that individuals end up not being able to analyse the facts which he/she sees and hears, becoming unable to assume a respectable position within an ever-growing capitalist and audio-visual society. <br><br> <br><br>For this, the questionnaires used in the 8th grade students of EMEF Lorenço Manoel Sparapan, in Sao Paulo, will serve as a basis for our comprehension about how the schools see the importance of this issue.

THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE INFORMATION-PROCESSING OF SOCIO-CULTURAL NORMS ON THE LEVELS OF BODY DISSATISFACTION AND THIN-IDEAL INTERNALIZATION
Joyce Dhawon Chung
William A. Shine Great Neck South High School, Great Neck, NY

Prior research supports that body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization are risk factors in the emergence of eating disorders among adolescents and young adults. This experiment sought to analyze whether the information-processing of socio-cultural norms would alter cognitive constructs of participants, leading to changes in body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization. Males were hypothesized to form different cognitive constructs from females, resulting in different changes in the levels of body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization.<br><br>The Body-Image Assessment Software (BIAS), a computer program that uploaded a virtual silhouette of the participants’ bodies onto the computer screen, assessed the level of body dissatisfaction of participants. The Multidimensional Media Influence Scale (MMIS) assessed the level of thin-ideal internalization of participants. After their levels of body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization were measured, participants in the experimental group were exposed to socio-cultural norms. Participants in the control group were exposed to neutral stimuli. Their levels of body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization were measured again. <br><br>Sixty-seven participants volunteered for the experiment (n=67). There were 25 male, 25 female, and 17 control participants. The female experimental participants experienced a great increase in body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization, while male experimental participants experienced a slight increase. Both experimental groups yielded statistically significant results (p<.05). Females were affected to a much greater extent than males after exposure to socio-cultural norms. Results suggest that females developed different cognitive constructs than males after construct intervention, leading to different changes in levels of body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal internalization.

QUE? QUOI? DO LANGUAGES WITH GRAMMATICAL GENDER PROMOTE SEXIST ATTITUDES?
Benjamin David Wasserman
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

A series of three experiments explored the link between the grammatical structures of a language and expressed sexist attitudes. It was hypothesized that students who read a passage and completed a survey of sexist attitudes in a language with grammatical gender would express more sexist attitudes than students who completed the same survey in a language without grammatical gender. In experiment one, 74 high school students enrolled in the five highest level Spanish classes read and completed either the Spanish version of the passage and survey or the English version. The students who completed the Spanish version expressed significantly more sexist attitudes than students who completed the survey in English (p<.05). The second experiment replicated the experiment on 85 high school upper-level French students. The students who completed the French version of the survey expressed significantly more sexist attitudes than students who completed the survey in English (p<.01). In the third experiment, the experiment was replicated on 66 high school students who were fluent in both English and Spanish. Students in the Spanish condition expressed marginally more sexist attitudes than students in the English condition (p=.057). In addition, in all three experiments, male participants expressed significantly more sexist attitudes than female participants (p<.01). The results of this study show support for the idea that languages with grammatical gender may promote sexist attitudes in people who read the language.

THE NEURAL BASIS OF THE DECISION TO REWARD OR PUNISH IN PARENTING: AN FMRI INVESTIGATION
Benjamin Julius Mueller
John L. Miller - Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY

Parents constantly make decisions that attempt to influence the behavior of their children through reward and punishment. Indeed, ever since the formulation of Thorndike’s law of effect in 1911, psychologists have grappled with the complex social interaction mediated by reward and punishment. Although recent fMRI studies have begun to investigate the neural bases of social decision-making, and some have even explored the processing of reward and punishment, the question of how the human brain makes the widely prevalent and deeply impactful decision to reward or punish has gone completely unexplored in the literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the specialized neural networks for decisions to reward and punish in parenting, and to locate the common neural network underlying both tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure brain activity in five human subjects as they responded to the hypothetical actions of a child with either of two levels of reward or punishment. The discovery of a common neural network confirmed the presence of categorization uncertainty in both types of decisions. Decisions to reward activated orbitofrontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and precentral gyrus, suggesting a deeply ingrained role for emotion in the decision to reward. On the other hand, the neural network associated with the decision to punish was found to include anterior cingulate gyrus, postcentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus, all high-level cognitive regions that suggest that the decision to punish requires a greater degree of regulation and reason.

MAKING THE CHOICE: AN FMRI ANALYSIS OF IMPULSE AND STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING IN CLASSIFICATION OF EMOTIONAL STIMULI
Zachary Spencer Lorsch
Oceanside Senior High School, Oceanside, NY

The ability to neurologically process and distinguish stimuli based on certain characteristics is an integral process within the human brain central to everyday life. Therefore, it is no surprise that humans use various decision-making strategies to make classifications and assertions based on both the stimuli presented as well as the scenario for analysis. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the neurological differences associated with two distinct methods of emotional decision-making. Twenty subjects (15 behavioral and 5 imaging) were asked to classify faces for emotional content at varying reaction times representing long term “strategic decisions” and quickly made “impulse decisions”. The impulse decision-making trial showed increased brain activity throughout most of the brain associated with decreased performance. Strategic decision-making was associated with large activity in the dorsal amygdala, which was not present in the impulse decision trial. When examining cognitive control mechanisms, cognitive control was evident in the impulse trial, not the strategic. Additionally, the amygdala was only active when performance was at its peak, suggesting a correlation between the amygdala and emotional decision-making. As a whole, these data suggest the use of different neurological pathways for different methods of decision making.

THE EFFECTS OF A STUDENT INSTRUCTIONAL BASED AUDIO VISUAL MODULE COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS ON PERFORMANCE BASED ASSESSMENT
Brooklyn Ann Noble
Orion Junior High, Harrisville, UT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the efficacy of modules in teaching sixth grade students science content. Three conditions were tested: a) live demonstrations alone, b) instruction-based module, and c) both a module and demonstration. A module is a show with both visual and audio representation that is created at a planetarium. Student content knowledge was tested using a ten question quiz prior to instruction and again ten days later to compare knowledge gained and analyze how much information they retained.<br><br>Six groups were formed from the 180 sixth grade students involved, with each condition used with two groups. Those groups exposed to the modules alone scored lower on the posttest than the other groups (a mean increase of only 13%). Those groups exposed to both the live demonstration and the modules increased the most on their posttest (a mean increase of 24.5%). The modules do work, but maybe there are other things to look into more closely. Due to my research and findings on this project, these student instruction-based modules are now in consideration to be sent out across the United States for use in classrooms.

INDEPENDENT CONFLICT-DRIVEN AND EXPECTANCY-DRIVEN MECHANISMS OF COGNITIVE CONTROL
Caitlyn Rose Lia
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

In order to attend selectively to task-relevant stimuli and ignore task-irrelevant stimuli, the brain needs to strategically control selective attention. Two control strategies, conflict-driven and expectancy-driven control, have been independently shown to guide selective attention. However, it is unknown whether these two sources of control are independent or connected mechanisms. Subjects were given a form of the Stroop Task that assessed both expectancy- and conflict-driven control, by presenting conflicting (incongruent) and non-conflicting (congruent) Stroop stimuli in probabilistic sequences, in order to examine how subjects’ responses were affected by conflict, expectancy, and a combination of the two. The data were analyzed to assess whether conflict- and expectancy-driven control are independent (leading to an additive, combined benefits) or inter-dependent (the effect of one control mechanism would depend on if the other mechanism was active). It was shown that the degree of expectancy-driven control effects was not dependent upon previous trial congruency, and that the degree of conflict-driven control was not dependent on stimulus expectancy. The data showed that both expectancy-driven and conflict-driven control, independently allowed for about 20 ms decrease in reaction time. Incongruent trials that presented both conflict and predictability allowed for a 40 ms decrease in reaction time (demonstrating additive effects). This suggests that expectancy-driven control and conflict-driven control are derived from two independent mechanisms within the brain. Future neuroimaging studies are necessary confirm these findings.

COGNITIVE AND IMPLICIT MEASURES OF ACCULTURATION IN ADOLESCENT HISPANIC AMERICANS
Mary Caitlin Williams
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Acculturation is psychological adaptation to a new culture and can contribute to distress, anxiety and even depression. These psychological effects can be examined on a cognitive (conscious) and implicit (subconscious) level. This study is the first to measure acculturation implicitly in conjunction with cognitive attitudes as an improved approach to measuring acculturation among adolescent Hispanic Americans, the youngest and fastest growing population in the United States. Cognitive and implicit disagreement may indicate internal conflict, which can lead to mental health problems and factors that influence cognitive and implicit acculturation are identified. Forty Hispanic Americans and a control group of forty Caucasian Americans completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) which measured implicit responses. Three new country-specific IAT sets were created on Inquest in Millisecond Software. A survey, The Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire (BIQ), measured cognitive attitudes. Of the Hispanic participants, 55% had internal conflict. The frequency of speaking Spanish with friends (cognitive p=.026, implicit p=.045), being born in America (cognitive p=.005, implicit p=.001) and English as a first language (cognitive p=.035, implicit p=.002) correlated positively with the degree of acculturation. Learning a language increases implicit associations with a new culture without lessening ties to native culture and friendship as a context for language plays an important role in implicit acculturation.

EFFECTS OF GENDER CONFORMITY ON THE VOCAL PATTERNS OF PREPUBESCENT CHILDREN
Angela Marie Frisk
Mankato West Senior High School, Mankato, MN

What are the effects of gender conformity on the vocal patterns of prepubescent children? Basically, I want to know if there is a distinguishable difference between the voices of young females and males before their voices physically change.<br><br> My subjects are children between the ages of four and ten. I will be going to a public place and asking families with children in this age group if they would like to volunteer. Once a subject has parental consent I will record the child speaking for about fifteen seconds. Each child will be numbered and information on their gender and age will be recorded. Adult volunteers will listen to the tapes and, on a form, will be asked what they believe the child’s gender to be and how confident they are in their guess. Their responses will be compared to the actual information on the gender of the children. The accuracy of the responses against the age of the children will be graphed. <br><br>Subjects were able to guess gender with an average of eighty-two percent accuracy. Though there was an overall positive relationship between both confidence and age and accuracy and age, there was a great amount of deviation from this pattern. As I plan to continue with this experiment, it will be necessary for me to interview a greater number of subjects. This should make a more definite pattern emerge.

THE DEVOLUTION OF COOPERATION: AN EXAMINATION OF EXCESSIVE NOISE IN THE ITERATED PRISONER'S DILEMMA
Thomas McLean Burr
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, a simulation of competition among a group of rational opponents, has been the focus of game theoretical and economic study since its development by Robert Axelrod in 1984. The use of replicator dynamics to simulate evolution and “noise” to simulate real world interactions has drawn the attention of both biologists and economists alike. In an age of increasing globalization and access to the world stage, minimal levels of noise may not accurately represent the disturbances caused by splinter groups of political movements. In this study, the effects of abnormal levels of noise, approaching twenty percent, are taken into account in order to reflect this increasingly evident situation. The question posed, therefore, is to find at what point cooperation begins to break down as a rational course of action for the player in the evolutionary form of the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma<br><br> The Iterated Prisoner’s dilemma was run through UNIX on the ICE server at Harvard University. The results achieved reflect the expected hypothesis. At noise levels approaching ten percent in the non evolutionary game, and twenty percent in the evolutionary game, non cooperative strategies such as Grim Trigger and Always Defect become dominant in the locality. Although the results achieved through this experiment are unique to this locality, the massive scope of the trials as well as the number of competitors show confidently a trend that can be applied to not only other simulations, but real world simulations as well.

DO YOU HAVE SYNESTHESIA? PHASE II
Alexandra Christine Hummel
Florence High School #14-1, Florence, SD

Synesthesia is a neurological condition, which multiple senses are stimulated to combine into a single perceptual experience. The purpose of this project was to see if and who Synesthesia transpires in, within a projected amount of people. Also, the project was intended to spread the knowledge of Synesthesia.<br><br>It was hypothesized that, females more so than males, would project more of a Synesthetic outcome and that more people would show Synesthetic-like tendencies than not.<br><br>The equipment used during the testing process included: a computer, the MATLAB Texsyn Toolbox Program, a questionnaire, and a pencil. There were six different types of Synesthesia tested: Grapheme-Color, Color-Number, Lexical Gustatory, Mirror Touch, Personification, and Sound-Music Synesthesia.<br><br>The subjects were first explained what Synesthesia was, and were then asked to complete a questionnaire of Synesthesia-based questions. Once completed, the data was reviewed to distinguish whether subjects projected tendencies, and if so, further testing was required. All data, was plugged into MATLAB until testing was complete. Then, data was converted into graphs and a Chi-square analysis of the study was made.<br><br>In conclusion, Synesthesia does occur in a vast amount of people. While, partially supporting the hypothesis, females did project a larger outcome than males in most of the categories, although, not completely. Though, further testing would be necessary for the Synesthetic certainty. As a whole, the project was succesful by showing that Synesthesia does exist regularly in people.

THE EFFECT OF MUSICAL TRAINING ON THE CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION OF MUSICAL SEQUENCES
Alysha Harper Owen
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown, PA

There are two cerebral hemispheres that specialize in different functions. In most right-handed people, the left hemisphere specializes in linguistic, analytic, and sequential tasks, whereas the right hemisphere specializes in spatial, synthetic, and holistic tasks.<br><br> Musical processing is generally lateralized to the right hemisphere in dextral humans. There is evidence to suggest that musical training may change musical processing into more of a linguistic task. The hypothesis of this experiment is that musical training will change the discrimination of musical chords from a right brain task to a left brain task.<br><br> Forty right-handed subjects (twenty musicians, ten female, ten male; twenty nonmusicians, ten female, ten male) were tested using two auditory dichotic stimulation tests: a word recognition test and a chord recognition test. In the verbal test, two different, similar-sounding words were presented by headphones simultaneously to each ear. The words were then played separately to both ears and the subject would identify which word was heard. The music test was presented similarly. A Cakewalk software program was used to synchronize and present the stimuli.<br><br> As expected, there was a right ear/left brain advantage in the verbal test (68.75% accuracy versus 29% accuracy),which was statistically significant by t-test analysis. On the musical task, musicians demonstrated a left hemispheric dominance in chord recognition (56% left hemispheric accuracy versus 44% right hemispheric accuracy), whereas nonmusicians demonstrated a right hemispheric dominance (55% right hemispheric accuracy versus 45% left hemispheric accuracy). These trends are most pronounced in female musicians (59% accuracy in the left hemisphere versus 41% accuracy in the right hemisphere) and male nonmusicians (59% accuracy in the right hemisphere and 41% accuracy in the left hemisphere). These trends support the hypothesis, but with the current population size, they do not reach statistical significance.<br><br> Ongoing expansion of this study involves enlarging the two test populations to an n=30 or more. With this additional data, t-testing will hopefully reach statistical significance and an ANOVA can be applied to examine the possible effect of gender.

IT'S A GUY THING: HOW FATHERS AFFECT DAUGHTERS' DATING HABITS
Emily Rose Summerbell
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

Recent research suggests that biological fathers affect their daughters’ sexual maturity, including menstruation. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether fathers have any effect on daughters’ dating habits. It was hypothesized that the presence of biological fathers in households would have a significant effect on the daughters’ dating habits.<br><br>“Dating habits” refers to any noticeable pattern or boundary observed in girls’ dating records. The fathers’ effects on age when daughter began dating, number of relationships, length of relationships, and relationship boundaries were measured by surveying 175 high school girls.<br><br>Using both t-tests and chi-squares, much data was found to be significant at the 0.05 significance level. Compared to girls not living with fathers, girls living with fathers begin dating at a statistically later age (p=0.0174), wait statistically longer in relationships to have sex (p=0.0387), and are significantly more likely to disapprove of sex while in high school (p=0.0004). Likewise, girls not living with fathers statistically have longer relationships (p=0.0049), date statistically more people, (p=0.0057), and are significantly more likely not to be abstinent (p=0.0005). <br><br>The results show that fathers have a significant effect on daughters’ dating habits. This data sheds light on the importance of father-daughter relationships, and possibly other family relationships, and the impact of social or physical connections on female adolescent development. Once again, nature proves that the family is a powerful social and biological force.

SYMMETRY-RELATED VISUAL STEREOTYPING IN ADOLESCENT FEMALES
Shannon Marie MacKenzie
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

Facial symmetry has been linked to corporal symmetry in theories stating that attraction is linked to symmetry. This research furthers symmetry research by hypothesizing that stereotyping based on eye symmetry will affect a viewer’s judgment of characteristics of “persons” viewed. It was anticipated that more positive characteristics would be associated with symmetry and negative with asymmetry. To test the hypothesis, seven face images were generated using Face 4.0 software. An asymmetrical counterpart for each was created by moving the right eye slightly up or down from its original position. Original and manipulated images were placed side-by-side in a PowerPoint survey and subjects were forced to choose between images with respect to characteristics of criminality, intellectuality, success in business, or celebrity status. Trends in response to slightly asymmetric images in Phase 1 led to Phase 2, where the degree of asymmetry was increased. Chi-square tests were run to determine whether responses were statistically different from a 50-50 distribution. Support/Reject ratios were determined by dividing the number of responses that corresponded with the hypothesis by the number of opposite responses. These ratios were analyzed according to characteristic, gender of image, and degree of asymmetry. Four degrees is clearly a point of asymmetry beyond which a positive or negative judgment was prompted in many subjects. Subjects, who were all female, judged female images more critically on the basis of symmetry than male images. Symmetry and asymmetry were not very important in judging criminality, but were very important for choosing successful business people and celebrities.

DOES TETRIS MAKE YOU SMARTER?
Julian Lyles Bass-Krueger
Clinton Senior High School, Clinton, NY

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if playing computer games primes subjects for taking intelligence tests. The video game Tetris was used to see if it enhanced performance on a spatial intelligence test. It was hypothesized that people playing Tetris before taking the test would score higher than those who had not played. The results support earlier research on what is called “mental set”—the process by which a person adapts his or her thinking to a particular challenge. The experiment also provides intriguing data for researchers studying the Flynn effect. Could computer games be one reason why IQ scores have increased markedly in the last few years?

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT FOOT USAGE ON PEDAL REACTION TIMES AND ACCURACY
Cathy Hsi Chen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the best way to control car pedals. Contradicting opinions regarding the optimal foot usage prompted this experiment. <br><br>Two foot pedals were wirelessly connected to a laptop. A software program written using Kids Programming Language was designed to test the reaction time and accuracy of three foot combinations: right foot only, left foot only, and both feet. Subjects would respond to colored prompts in the middle of the computer screen. The program recorded all reaction times and accuracy. The order of testing was randomized.<br><br> A total of 52 high subjects were tested. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the right foot only and left foot only reaction times. However, using both feet turned out to be significantly faster with an average of 0.6671 seconds. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of all three combinations. Also, subjects who drive manual cars, have significantly faster left foot reactions times because of their constant use of their left feet, as do left handed subjects. Subjects with driving experience make significantly more mistakes when switching to using both feet. <br><br> It can be concluded from this experiment that controlling car pedals with both feet is significantly faster and does not make more mistakes than using only one foot. It can also be concluded that experience has a big effect on accuracy.

THE EFFECTS OF INQUIRY-BASED TEACHING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WITHIN SUBGROUPS SCORING AT "NEARING PROFICIENT" (GRADE LEVEL) OR ABOVE ON THE MISSOURI ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (MAP) TEST AT THE 7TH GRADE LEVEL IN THE SECTION OF SCIENCE
Jordan Elizabeth Stevens
West Platte R-2 High School, Weston

The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) have labeled 32% of Missouri’s schools in the category of “Needing Improvement.” Missouri schools are not the only ones impacted. Schools across the nation are being held accountable for improving student progress by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). This study concerned the effects of inquiry-based teaching on the percentage of students within subgroups performing at or above grade level on Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) test in the section of science at the 7th grade level. The MAP test is Missouri’s version of a standardized assessment. Schools were selected using Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) website to ascertain the student to teacher ratio range to one of fifteen to twenty. Surveys were created and mailed to 140 schools across the state, fitting the ratio criteria, 42 schools responded. The surveys were grouped into the test groups of inquiry-based teaching with science fair projects, inquiry-based teaching with no science fair projects, and the control group of no inquiry-based teaching and without science fair projects. The data was separated into the subgroups of male, female, and students in the free and reduced lunch program. An analysis of the performance of these subgroups on MAP test indicated the school districts using inquiry-based curriculum had a statistically higher percentage of students scoring at or above grade level compared to the subgroups of the school districts without inquiry-based instruction.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NAIL BITING AND OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER
Alexander Laszlo Peterkin
Oakton High School, Vienna, VA

Nail biting can be anything from a bad habit to a serious medical condition. Although the cause of nail biting is multifactorial, severe nail biting, or onychophagia, is a disorder that may be associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In order to explore this relationship, a cross-sectional study was designed to determine if the severity of nail biting is linked to the likelihood of having symptoms of OCD. <br><br>An anonymous survey with informed consent was distributed to university students. Data was collected on degree of nail biting, symptoms of OCD, age, gender, GPA, family history, and other body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB). The severity of nail biting was quantified and a modified Yale-Brown OCD Scale was used.<br><br>Of the 189 total respondents, 89 were severe nail biters. Sixty-three percent of all severe nail biters had symptoms of OCD. The odds ratio of having symptoms of OCD if one were a severe nail biter was 13.73:1, statistically significant (P<0.0001). However, a linear relationship between the degree of nail biting and increasing symptoms of OCD was not found. Also, 79% of nail biters had at least one other BFRB and 61% had a positive family history.<br><br>A definite link between severe nail biting and symptoms of OCD was established. However, milder degrees of nail biting were not conclusively associated with increasing symptoms of OCD. Establishing a relationship between severe nail biting and OCD is important for investigating a common cause and may lead to better treatments in the future.

CORRELATING ANATOMICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ASYMMETRY
Shauna Theresa Linn
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD

The human brain shows left-right (L-R) differences in neuroanatomy and is functionally lateralized, with each hemisphere specialized for specific behavioral or cognitive tasks. Functional brain asymmetry is no longer considered uniquely human, but rather thought to be a feature common to all vertebrates. How L-R asymmetry arises in the developing nervous system remains unclear. <br><br> The zebrafish forebrain is an excellent model for studying the basis of brain asymmetry. In >98% of larvae, the pineal complex contains a parapineal organ on the left side of the brain. The adjacent brain nucleus, the left habenula, is larger, has denser neuropil and shows distinct patterns of gene expression compared to the right habenula. While the function of this asymmetry is unknown, the parapineal serves as a useful marker of the direction of brain laterality.<br><br> Genetic manipulations in zebrafish embryos allow L-R asymmetry of the brain and visceral organs (e.g., liver and pancreas) to be reversed. I set out to test whether such “reversed-brain” larvae show behavioral differences in visual and locomotor assays. <br><br> Left and right-parapineal larvae show no difference in eye preference when viewing a group of age-matched conspecifics. Interestingly, reversed-brain larvae take significantly longer to begin navigating, suggesting that they have reduced biological fitness (e.g., they are slower to adapt to novel environments). L-R directional brain asymmetry, but not visceral asymmetry, dictates differences in locomotor behavior. One possibility is that the asymmetric region of the zebrafish forebrain influences other regions of the brain that mediate motivation and fear.

A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR FADED MINDS: A LINK BETWEEN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, THE SENSES AND MEMORY RETRIEVAL
Elyse Marie Doherty
Taunton High School, Taunton, MA

Alzheimer’s disease and memory loss can be tragic on many levels. Memories are essential in defining our experiences, our relationships and who we are. Memories of our youth, our education and our families are just some of the many experiences that make an individual who he or she is. The loss of these can lead to changes in personality or even loss of sense of self. Memory loss can disrupt one’s ability to perform everyday tasks. This experiment was designed to determine whether the senses of Alzheimer’s patients could cause recollection of past experiences. <br><br> It hypothesized that the patients’ memory retrieval and contentment status will be increased after this experiment. Three Alzheimer’s Scales (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini Nutritional Assessment and the Montgomery Asberg D Rating Scale) were used to measure contentment and memory recall. The patients were visited four times a week over a period of twelve weeks and objects from patients’ pasts were presented to them using a shadow box in an effort to recover memory. Changes in patients’ memory or contentment status as determined by the Alzheimer’s scales were recorded. <br><br> The three tests given to each patient showed numerical data which in turn proved that memory and contentment were enhanced as a result of the experiment. Each patient improved in these areas each week. These results have supported the hypothesis. According to the three tests given to each subject, it was proven that sensory stimulation was a factor in recovering memory and creating contentment for patients with Alzheimer’s.

For the first time in the history of the United States a woman or African American male could become the president. Does physical appearance or gender affect voter outcome? The purpose of this study was to see if facial appearance and gender had an effect on voting patterns in presidential elections. Three triggers were used: weight, gender, and facial expression. Each candidate was rated for attractiveness, likability, electability, leadership ability, competence, dominance, and compassion. Eight different photos with various combinations of the three triggers were morphed using Photoshop. Comparisons were made between smiling and neutral faces, normal weight and obese people, and males and females. The survey was designed to collect demographics from the participants. Data was collected at a local university from participants ranges in age from 18 to 53 years old. It was found that the more likable the candidate was, the more they seemed to be compassionate and competent. Health ranked significantly higher than weight and attractiveness when asked what characteristics were most important in a presidential candidate. However, it was found that appearance significantly affects how a presidential candidate is perceived, and a single photo of a candidate can be manipulated to sway voters' opinions.

THE EFFECT OF NASAL BREATHING AND FOREHEAD COOLING ON THE INCIDENCE OF CONTAGIOUS YAWNING
Sarah N. Bui
Battlefield High School, Haymarket, VA

The purpose of my experiment was to investigate the function of yawning in relation to brain temperature. Since the only difference between contagious and spontaneous yawns is its triggers, I used a depicting people yawning because I used contagious yawns as a proxy for my experiment. The video was played for two minutes and thirty seconds while subjects manipulated their forehead temperatures with a warm, cool, and room temperature pack, or changing their breathing methods; nasally, orally, with a nose-plug, and normally. After testing 100 subjects in each scenario; one manipulating breathing methods and the other forehead temperature, I found that my hypothesis- if the temperature of the body (specifically the brain) increases, then the number of times a person yawns will also increase; was supported by my data. Since breathing through the nose and holding a cool pack to the forehead are the best ways to reduce brain temperature, the subjects did not have to yawn and was not affected by the contagious yawning in the video. The participants in the nasal breathing group had brain temperatures which were already in homeostasis and did not need to yawn. As the temperature of the brain decreased, so did the number of contagious yawns. Ninety-two percent of the subjects holding a warm pack to their foreheads yawned. This supports my assumption that yawning serves as a thermoregulatory function in order to maintain mental efficiency and the vigilance of an individual or of an entire group.

DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? SCHOOL PERFORMANCE, PERCEPTIONS, AND SPENDING SUPPORT
Katherine M. Fredieu
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

When social problems arise, citizens develop different attitudes towards supporting a government solution if they perceive a problem. Because citizens' opinions affect policy, it is important to understand (1) how they think, in this case regarding the accuracy of their perception of school performance, (2) how that affects their views on policy, particularly willingness to spend on education, and (3) how trust in government mediates this relationship. A data analysis was completed to study these questions and ideas relating to political trust. Independent variables were controlled for to permit me to understand the reasons a person might have had a certain attitude towards one of the main questions. Although these questions are applicable to other states, Louisiana is an ideal state to study, since school performance differs greatly from parish to parish and there are varying levels of trust for the government due to past corruption. Questions from the 2002 Louisiana Survey judge the citizens' perceptions of schools in their parish and policy views, and the state's LEAP test scores measure each parish's school performance.<br><br><br> I confirmed my research hypothesis that most citizens perceive school performance correctly and are more willing to spend on education as school performance worsens. A striking difference appeared between respondents who have low-trust and high-trust for the government along with other significant factors stated in the analysis. The framework of the analysis can be applied in other states and on other spending issues to understand the citizens' attitudes toward spending to solve policy problems.

SOUND DIRECTIONALITY
Julia Suzanna Schenk
Walter Payton College Prep High School, Chicago, IL

It is a well-known fact that people's ability to hear generally worsens as they age due to deteriorating anatomy. The purpose of this experiment, however, is to test people of varying ages to determine whether the ability to discern sound directionality is a function of frequency or age. Some background reading led me to believe that hearing a sound is not the same as interpreting it. For this reason, I hypothesized that the ability to detect directionality would be based on frequency, not age. <br><br> Using Adobe Audition 1.0, I created a CD with four separate tracks consisting of computer-generated tones. The tracks were at 75, 200, 800, and 1400 Hertz, repectively. The sound in both earbuds started at zero decibels. The left earbud's decibels decreased by a nonlinear increment while the right earbud's decibels remained at zero; the right earbud's decibels decreased by that same increment while the sound in the left earbud returned to zero decibels. This same progression of decreasing volume between earbuds occurred until the subject could determine sound directionality. Test subjects completed a consent form and survey, and then were tested individually in a quiet room. Results were drawn from a total of thirty-five people, ages twelve to seventy-five. <br><br> When plotted on graphs exhibiting age (x) and difference in volume (decibels, y), the data suggested that sound directionality is more dependent on frequency than age. The results support the conclusion that the ability to determine sound directionality improves with frequency, although there were sources of error.

BALLIN'!

For my project I tested to see if the hand and eye dominance of female basketball players has anything to do with their free-throw shooting percentage.<br><br> I decided to test our junior high and varsity girls' basketball teams. I figured if I did this I could not place them all together in the same group so I put them in different age categories: 12-14, 15-16, and 17-18. This seemed like an easier way to show my results and how my players should improve with age. This also seemed like the fairest way to do this rather than placing a seventh grader in the same category than a senior. I also looked at the previous free-throw shooting percentages from the 2007 basketball season and added them to my calculations also. <br><br> When I tested each subject, I first found out their eye dominance. I did this by having the subject extend their arms out in front of their face and make a triangle shape. I placed a basketball sticker on the wall and had them center the sticker between their hands. Once they had centered the sticker, I asked them to close their left eye. If the sticker was covered up by their hand it meant that they were right-eye dominant. I had them do the same with their right eye and if the sticker was covered by their hand that meant they were left-eye dominant. Next, I asked each subject for they hand that they shoot, write, eat, and throw etc. with. After I got this information, I had the subject shoot 15 free-throws. Then I figured out the percentage of their shots. Later on I also found their shooting percentage from 2007. Then, I added the percentages together to make and overall percentage of that subjects shooting. <br><br> My hypothesis was that crossed hand/eye dominance would be beneficial for the athlete. I thought this because when a basketball is being shot and the dominant eye and hand are on the same side, the dominant eye is covered.<br><br> I found that my hypothesis was not correct. Fortunately half of the subjects were right eye dominant and the other half were left eye dominant. I found that the subjects that were dominant with their right hand and left eye had better free-throw percentages in the 12-14, 15-16, and 17-18 age categories.

VIDEO GAMES: THE NEXT GENERATION'S ADDICTION
Ethan Garrett Guinn
Moore High School, Moore, OK

The purpose of the study is to determine if video game addiction is present within our society and to examine the effects it may have on participants. This was studied using a survey created to evaluate addiction level based on an American Medical Association recognized survey to asses gambling addiction. A numerical rubric was created to assess level of addiction. Personal information was also surveyed to examine the change in public opinion regarding gaming, find evidence of various affects of gaming within the participants’ lives, and to look for personal characteristics that might correlate to higher levels of addiction. Results showed that 69% of male participants and 44% of all female participants showed addiction ranging from borderline to severe. Evidence also indicates that the addiction level is higher at the junior high grade levels, implying that younger age groups are developing the addiction at a higher rate. A few of the negative effects observed included 24% of participants lying to others to play, 24% reported playing resulting in fights with friends and family, 31% reported a reduced productivity level in school, 27% reported choosing gaming over spending time with family or friends, and 47% reported poor eating habits during gaming. This study indicates an increasing level of addiction to games and negative effects as a result of gaming. This demonstrates that video game addiction is an increasing psychological disorder that should be recognized and addressed within our society.

IS THERE A GENE WHICH INFLUENCES BOTH IRIS MORPHOLOGY AND PERSONALITY-RELATED BRAIN DEVELOPMENT?
Cameron Hansen
Carbon High School, Price, UT

This project investigated whether there is a correlation between ocular iris morphology and personality characteristics.<br><br>Subjects completed the Keirsey Temperament Sorter-II personality inventory, and then their eyes were photographed. The photographs were categorized based on the presence or absence of iris Fuchs' crypts and the presence or absence of iris contraction furrows.<br><br>Subjects with four or more iris crypts were more likely to be classified as "introverted" and were more likely to be classified as "tough-minded" compared to people with fewer crypts. Subjects with zero to three iris crypts were more likely to be classified as "extroverted" and were more likely to be classified as "friendly" compared to people with four or more crypts. Subjects with contraction furrows longer than 1/4 of the iris circle were more likely to be classified as "observant" compared to people with smaller furrows. Subjects with furrows less than 1/4 of the iris circle were more likely to be classified "introspective" compared to people with longer furrows. These associations were found to be statistically significant at a p<0.05 using Chi-squared statistical analysis.<br><br>I conclude that statistically significant correlations exist between iris morphology and personality characteristics. It is possible that these correlations reflect genetic factors which influence the development of both the eye and the brain. Further research in this area may help us understand human neurodevelopment and psychological development.

ESSENCES OF INTELLIGENCES
Alisa Melekhina
Northeast High School, Philadelphia, PA

The purpose of this project was to determine which of the four current theories of intelligence in the field of cognitive psychology and psychometry —general intelligence factor (measured by IQ tests), Triarchic Theory of Successful Intelligence (emphasizes Analytic, Creative, and Practical intelligence), Multiple Intelligences (recognizes 8 intelligences: Linguistic, Mathematical, Musical, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Spatial, Naturalistic, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal) and Emotional Intelligence—has the largest positive correlation with students’ PSAT test scores and GPA. A fifth, novel theory of intelligence called Strategic and Tactical Perception based on the game of chess was also tested. <br><br> It was hypothesized that the simulated IQ test will have the largest correlation with PSAT test scores and GPA. Emotional Intelligence will have the lowest and most insignificant correlations with every test and variable. <br><br> The procedure included administering the five simulated intelligence tests to a class of 11th graders over a five-week period. <br><br> The results indicated that the most significant Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient established was 0.665682 between composite PSAT scores and Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test (STAT) scores. Emotional Intelligence did not correlate significantly at all with any test and even produced several negative correlations.<br><br> Major conclusions found include that the PSAT is most related in format to the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test, there is an alarming problem of “inflated” GPAs, introducing chess in the school curriculum would increase test scores and performance, and Emotional Intelligence correlates negatively with other tests because neurologically, it differs the most from all of the other intelligence theories: Advanced aptitude skills are controlled by the Neocortex, while emotional responses and comprehensions originate in the antiquated Limbic System and Reptilian Complex (R-Complex) of the human brain.

THE PROBLEM OF "REGIME OF ARTIFICIAL TIME" AND ITS INFLUENCE ON HUMAN HEALTH
Mikhail Yurievich Lobanov
Evening School, Polyarniy, Murmansk region, RUSSIA

The aim of this project is to define the connection between human daily biorhythms and his chronotype with his general state, his ability to work and the functioning of the systems of human organism of vital importance in the regime of «artificial time». The main tasks of project are - How does the regime of work and influence health? What is the meaning of human biorhythms and chronotype for his health? Does the regime of «artificial time» correspond to human biorhythms and his chronotype in modern conditions? Yow is it possible to bring daily human biorhythms and chronotype to the correspondence with his regime of work and rest? Methods and ways, which were used in project: theoretical analysis of literature; systematization and generalization; survey; practical experiment; observation. At the end of this research work we found that the regime of human work and rest existed in modern conditions (regime of “artificial” time) doesn’t correspond to human natural biorhythms and chronotype and this must be taken into consideration while planning the time for work (study) and for rest.

HOW WE THINK, WHO WE ARE: HOW WE LEARN?
Megan Danielle Johnson
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

Methods of learning are a prevalent topic in psychological research. The object of this study was to determine a method by which learning style can be predicted using the explanatory variables gender, handedness, age, family size, birth order, and cerebral dominance. The learning styles studied were visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic. The sample consisted of 432 students between the ages of 8 and 18 and all data were collected using a survey and series of questionnaires. Cerebral dominance was determined to be the only variable of statistical significance although gender did play a minor role in predicting learning style. Though the data were statistically significant, the regression model produced in the multi-variate analysis proved a poor fit for the data. However, there exists a positive correlation of visual and reading/writing learning with left brain dominance and a positive correlation of aural and kinesthetic learning with right brain dominance. Extensions for this project include replacement of the surveys with performance based assessments to test for strengths rather than preference, refinement of the sample, and incorporation of additional variables.

WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS ON RACIAL PROFILING?
Ariel Nicole Wiley
Basha High School, Chandler, AZ

Racial profiling is a major concern in American society, especially in areas such as law enforcement. Law enforcement programs emphasize eliminating racial profiling from their system. However relatively little is known as to which facial features are key to racial profiling, which brings about the question what is the impact of physical characteristics on racial profiling? A variety of people were selected in order to confirm or deny the hypothesis that, “There is a positive correlation between physical traits and racial classification.” High school and college students of both genders and varied ethnicities were used to explore the impact of facial features on racial bias. A survey containing 125 different facial pictures with ethnically specific features such as hair, eyes, eyebrows, lips, and noses were used to determine which features are associated with racial profiling. All pictures had the same skin color. The ethnic groups surveyed generally recognize features associated with their own ethnicity faster than features associated with the other ethnicities. The three most prominent defining features in profiling were hair, eyebrows, and lips. Many subjects were surprised to find, once the survey was over, that none of the faces had actual skin color, even though many subjects read different skin colors into the pictures. This information can help clarify which features are central to racial profiling. It is apparent racial profiling is not based on skin color alone. Future research is needed to more fully assess the impact of individual ethnic features.

A GAME OF THEORY, LEVEL II
Willie Tenell Reaves
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which consistency strategy of game theory, if any, most significantly affects the responses that high school students choose on multiple-choice exams. The eight-section survey contained all permutations of two colors (blue and green) and odd numbers in order to simulate a full range of survey options. After conducting data analysis, it was determined that many students do utilize a consistency method, and that the numerical method (i.e. choosing the same number throughout the survey) was the most common method, having amassed 37% of the overall selections. The Mixed Methods and No Obvious Pattern categories only received a combined 12 percent of survey responses. Various consistency methods displayed a considerably higher rate of use. <br><br>The surveys were administered to a random sample of one hundred Muskogee High School students. After locating a willing participant, the project and its associated Consent Form were explained to him/her, and his/her understanding of both were ascertained. The participant completed and returned the surveys and Consent Form, obtaining necessary parental/guardian permission. <br><br>The conclusion of this experiment was that there was sufficient evidence to support my null hypothesis that more than half of participants would utilize a consistency game theory strategy.

ANALYSIS OF VOCAL LEARNING IN FOXP2
Omar Waqqas Hussain
McArthur High School, Hollywood, FL

Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been necessary for the development of the human culture. Most vertebrates communicate acoustically, but a few among them such as humans, dolphins and whales, bats, and three orders of birds, use vocal learning as a means and method of communication. FOXP2 is the first gene linked to human speech and has been the target of specific study during recent primate evolution (Haesler, 2004). <br><br> <br><br>During this experimentation the researcher used a bioinformatics database to acquire nucleotide sequences for 22 organisms which would be divided into subclasses of vocal and non vocal organisms. From there 1452 microsatellites were determined to target di, tri, and tetra nucleotide sequences. Microsatellites are a good indicator of determining evolutionary links or kinship. Out of 42 different microsatellites approximately 62.6 percent of all microsatellites occurred in the vocal learners, while 37.4 occurred in non vocal learners, this shows us that they have in common many sequences like (GCA)3 and (CAG)3 but differ in the proportions of other nucleotide sequences such as the other di microsatellites, (AA)9.<br><br>Since ts = 0.755 is less than t05 = 2.021 do not reject the null.<br><br>This can be explained because organisms are more alike than they are different. The basic code is four nitrogenous bases, A,T,G and C. However, the small changes in a gene (mutation) can results in big changes to the organisms and potentially to each species.

A NOVEL LOW COST DESIGN OF TIC TAC TOE BOARDGAME FOR VISUALLY CHALLENGED
Vishakh Hegde
M.E.S Kishora Kendra High School, Bangalore, Karnataka, INDIA

I have created a low-cost, specially-designed version of Tic-Tac-Toe for the visually challenged. Apart from providing entertainment, the project also helps in observing changes in their behavior and mental ability. Instead of traditional X and O’s there are two types of pawns which they can touch, feel and identify. This game box consists of a simple circuit on the baseboard. It has some gaps in the circuit, which are bridged appropriately when the pawns are inserted. The circuit works purely electromechanically, there is no complex logic circuits/ICs etc. that are used, and can hence be made at very low cost. This is the main innovation of this project.<br><br>I recognized the disability of visually challenged to play normal Tic Tac Toe and have been experimenting with various designs. In the latest (6th version) prototype, the circuit is made on a Printed Circuit Board, an improvement from the other 5 designs which contain thin copper sheets as conductors. Unlike the other 5 prototypes, this circuit includes 4 buzzers (i.e. 2 buzzers to indicate win of 2 players, 1 to indicate drawn game and one when each player inserts a pawn). I have used a monostable circuit for the latter, to reduce the continuous buzzer sound into a beep. I have used stronger magnets for better contacts. I have made small notches around the central slot. It serves as a reference point for other slots. An instruction manual has been provided in Braille and English to enable them to play independently.<br><br>I tested the game box with the visually challenged students and gave them a questionnaire and obtained their feedback. I then left one of my prototypes at the school for their use, visited them a week later and again obtained their feedback. I noticed a lot of improvement in their confidence level and mental strength in matters of defense and approach. According to the teachers, it has improved their alertness, enthusiasm, memory, finger dexterity, eye-hand and ear-hand coordination. This is a low cost and portable game-box affordable to everyone. This gadget runs off standard low-voltage DC batteries and is completely safe and rugged. It has thus succeeded in converting the paper-pen format into board format and simultaneously has helped them to learn concepts of rows, columns and diagonals.

DIFFERENTIAL RECALL OF COLOR AND BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES
Anthony Richard Douglas
HomeLife Academy, Memphis, TN

The purpose of this study was to determine if color attributes help create stronger memory recall. Also, comparisons of gender, object type, and order of image presentation were compared to see if they had any effect on the short term ability to recall images. <br><br> Color images might increase attention, give more information about the object, and better link the image with memories already created in the brain. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a person who studies color illustrations would recall more of them than if that person studied either black and white illustrations or a page with both color and black and white illustrations.<br><br> Each subject was given one minute to study twenty illustrations and then asked to verbally recall as many as possible. The procedure was used for three types of illustration pages. The pages had 1) color illustrations, 2) black and white illustrations, and 3) color images alternating with black and white images. The sheets were presented in random order. Two sets of sheets were used, one with animal images and one with illustrations of household objects.<br><br> The order of the sheet presentation did not make a difference, nor did the use of animal images compared to the use of illustrations of household objects. Females recalled more images from the black and white sheet and the color sheets. On average, both genders recalled the most images from the sheet of color images, and fewer from the sheet of black and white images. The fewest images were recalled from the sheet of mixed illustrations.<br><br> These results supported the hypothesis that more images would be recalled from the sheet of color illustrations than from the sheet of black and white images or the sheet of mixed images.

COMPARING ATTITUDES TOWARD ADHD IN THE WORKPLACE
Janelle Christina Thixton
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects as many as eight million adults; because of its prevalence, this disorder has a profound affect on the workplace dynamic. It was hypothesized that knowledgeable nonprofessionals would perceive ADHD in the workplace the same as mental health professionals, and that this group would have a more realistic perception (as portrayed in the literature cited) than the general population. A ten statement Likert scale survey was created by the researcher. Surveys were distributed at the 2007 Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD) conference in Washington D.C. and outside the Clarksville, Indiana Wal-Mart. The surveys were separated into three groups: mental health professionals, non mental health professionals from the CHADD conference, and general population. Half of the statements on the survey were designed to receive a positive response and half were designed to receive a negative response. ANOVA and two-tailed Student’s t-Test were used to compare the responses to each statement. A total of 132 surveys were received. Fourteen surveys were excluded because they were missing answers to statements or background questions, leaving 118 that were used. Fifty-seven of these were from the general population, 15 were from non mental health professionals who attended the CHADD conference, and 46 were from mental health professionals. The difference between the general population and the more informed groups was significant at the .025 level overall. The data indicates that both the CHADD nonprofessionals and mental health professionals perceive ADHD more realistically than the general population, so the hypothesis was supported. There were no statistically significant differences between the responses given by different genders and age groups within each group.

SOCIODOMINANCE AND SEXUAL SELF-SCHEMA AS MODERATORS IN SEXIST REACTIONS TO FEMALE SUBTYPES
Alyssa Frielle Fowers
Maritime Science and Technology Senior High School, Key Biscayne, FL

Sexism both benevolent and hostile is detrimental to young people of both genders. Young women are forced into stereotypes, thereby limiting their social and academic potential. Young men are limited because their relationships with women are distorted by sexism. Sibley and Wilson (2004) studied men's benevolent and/or hostile sexist reactions in response to a "chaste" woman and a "promiscuous" woman. The "chaste" woman elicited strong benevolent sexist responses and weak hostile sexist responses, while the "promiscuous" woman elicited weak benevolent sexist responses and strong hostile sexist responses. In this study, the reactions of both men and women to one of two vignettes were gauged using the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and a similar expiremental method to Sibley and Wilson. In both vignettes, a female character, Kate, is described as either promiscuous or chaste before having a few drinks, dancing with an acquaintance, and then refusing an offer of casual sex. Sex of respondent, sociodominance, dispositional envy, and sexual self-schema were tested as moderators in this study. I predicted that both women and men wold have reactions that mirrored those in Sibley and Wilson. Additionally, I predicted that reactions would be moderated by sociodominance, dispositional envy, and sexual self-schema. The results of this study indicated that women reacted on average with lower hostile sexism and higher benevolent sexism than men, and the chaste character in the vignette was greeted with lower hostile sexism and higher benevolent sexism than the promiscuous character. Sociodominance and sexual self-schema moderated the levels of hostile and benevolent sexism.

A STUDY INTO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MUSICAL LITERACY AND LINGUISTIC ACUITY
Sarah Elisabeth Clayton
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, AL

This study offers an analysis of the idea of a direct correlation between music instruction and language development. The research presented involves study of the brain regions involved with both language processing and music instruction and the relationship between the two processes. Analysis extends primarily into phonemic awareness but also heavily emphasizes spatiotemporal awareness and the transfer theory of learning, as measured through high school and college students’ ACT scores in the areas of reading and English.<br><br> After the study was conducted, the data supported the hypothesis that musicians would have a greater aptitude for language. The conditional hypothesis, that men would be more affected than women, was also upheld. All tests of significance were conducted using right tailed t-sample tests at the 0.5% level of significance, showing that men were significantly affected but there was no significant change in the women’s scores.<br><br> The conclusion of this research implicates many other scientific questions, such as those related to the near-transfer hypothesis, and many political and social comments as well, especially those concerning arts funding in public schools.

WHAT'S STRESSIN' YOU OUT?
Amanda Michelle Rutland
Tipton-Rosemark Academy, Millington, TN

As teen stress is a very common issue, this project was performed to develop an overall stress level for high school students, discover which factors cause students the most stress, and to learn student’s opinions concerning the effect of sleep on their stress level. To find the answers to the above questions, one-hundred and twenty students were surveyed. Out of each high school grade level, fifteen males and fifteen females were surveyed. The results were compiled, compared, and posted. My hypothesis that females are more stressed than males was proven to be correct. The junior class was proven to have the highest overall stress level. School was proven to be the highest overall stress factor, while the war in Iraq and the presidential election were proven to cause students the least amount of stress. Concerning the effect of sleep on stress level, sixty-six percent of students believe that if they were to receive more sleep on a regular basis, their stress level would be reduced. This number was consistent between genders and grade levels. In conclusion, teen stress is a common issue which must be addressed by the individual. By receiving more sleep on a regular basis and possibly practicing better time-management techniques concerning schoolwork, teens have the power to potentially lower their overall stress level.

This research project (BExplorer) aims to find an alternative solution for traditional methods used for assisting the visually impaired people to move from one place to another safely and confidently. <br><br>Being visually impaired could, in many cases, restrict individuals' mobility. This limitation has a great negative impact, specifically on young visually challenged kids.<br><br>BExplorer is an electronic flexible device that uses set of well-coordinated ultrasound sensors controlled by electronic circuit to alert the visually impaired people (using different tones through headphone set) of the presence of any potentially dangerous obstacle. <br><br>The BExplorer device uses three ultrasound sensors. The first sensor aims to discover objects that are low (less than 30 cm high from the ground). The second sensor aims to discover low grounds and holes. The third sensor aims to discover low hanging objects or low ceilings. <br><br>After planning safe experiments and testing procedures, the BExplorer trials results showed that the device was preferred over traditional assisting methods and was accepted by wide range of ages of visually impaired individuals. <br><br>A major advantage of the BExplorer is its simple operating procedures and that it can be mounted on cloth and can be adjusted for different heights and ages. <br><br>In conclusion, BExplorer device was found to increase confidence and allow individuals to be more engaged in sports and social activities. In addition, BExplorer allows visually impaired kids to be more mobile and be able to interact more in a safe manner with their environment, increases their chance for learning and growing their personal experience.<br><br>

This research project studies the possibility of allowing individuals with complete paralysis disability to be able to control their movement using Artificial Intelligence (Robotics Technology) without needs for continuous assistance <br><br>Individuals with complete paralysis disabilities are deprived from their ability to control their movement and transportation as they are usually led by assistant due to their inability to move hand or foot muscles. This results in low self-esteem and low sense of confidence. Such problems could lead to long term psychological problems.<br><br>RoboMask research studies the applicability of using a mask (built using Lego NXT Smart Brick) that utilizes tongue muscles to operate touch-sensors and translate them to commands to control wheelchairs used by people with full paralysis disabilities.<br><br>A survey study was done on 5 individuals with paralysis disability who are currently using electronic wheelchair. RoboMask system was installed on the wheelchair and the system operated successfully. All individuals expressed satisfaction to the performance of the prototype device.<br><br> <br><br>RoboMask opens the door for young researchers to explore available robotics kits to help people with special needs. It also emphasizes how proper and intelligent utilization of one muscle (i.e. tongue) can help people with special needs go along way.

THE AMOUNT OF COMPUTER USAGE AFFECTS TEENAGE MALES' ACUITY MORE THAN FEMALES'
Josean Manuel Perez, Yevgeniy Kostenko, Faduma Ahmed-Ali
Westview High School, Portland, OR

A study of how vision is affected by both short-term and long-term computer use. A specific age group was selected to be tested, and it involved 13 to 18 year olds, composed almost evenly between males and females. Short-term was defined as 45 minutes of computer usage while long-term was defined as 2 hours. The subject's vision was tested prior to using the computer and after using the computer. The Snellen eye chart was used to test differences in acuity. The control data equates to acuity results prior to testing. This is compared to the acuity results after either short-term or long-term computer use. A trend found was that females started the test with a better acuity index on average than males. For short term, the negative impact of computer usage between males and females was only different by 4%, yet for long-term, there was 22% difference between males and females. The regression line before and after in females was positive, while for males, the slope of the regression line before is positive, while after it is negative. Females' vision does not appear to be as affected by computer usage as males'. A short survey was given after the tests to better understand the lifestyle of the test subjects in order to determine the results.

HITLER VS. KING
Griffin Carter Miller, Conrad Bandoroff, 
Sayre School, Lexington, KY

King vs. Hitler examines the impact of who makes a statement on our decision making. Are we inclined to agree with Martin Luther King Jr. and to disagree with Adolf Hitler simply because of whom they are? 84 people diversified evenly by race, faith, and education were asked if they Agreed or Disagreed with the same two statements, one attributed to King and the other to Hitler. 42 were inaccurately told the speaker of the statement and 42 were accurately told the speaker. 66% of the surveyed people Agreed when King was attributed as the speaker, even if Hitler actually was the speaker. 46% Agreed when Hitler was attributed as the speaker, even if King actually was the speaker. A person’s decision making process is significantly influenced by who makes a statement rather than by the statement’s contents. People are more inclined to Agree with King, a famous humanitarian and civil rights activist, and more inclined to Disagree with Hitler, infamous for his atrocities during WW II, simply by virtue of his name.

VISUALIZE AND MEMORIZE
Jesse Jon Davila, Mark Salas, 
Del Rio High School, Del Rio, TX

Our project began essentially to test the effectiveness of visual aids on memory retention. This project is comprised from eight basic tests. We randomly composed twenty-five color items for eight tests and then introduced different visual aids and organizational patterns to see how they helped or distracted the test subject. Upon administering the test, we gave the subject one minute to view the study sheet, and an additional minute to record as much of the information they could remember on a blank answer sheet. Our hypothesis was proven correct when the memory retention results show an increase over the results from the control group, which was a set of colors in black ink. The visual aids, which included color text, physical aids, and organizational patterns, raised the scores.

A DISCUSSION ABOUT EQUALITY: A GENDER STUDY IN THE CLASSROOM
Mary Alysandra Patzel, Jessica Cummins, 
West Salem High School, Salem, OR

Within societies, individuals often present rules and patterns of interaction. In typical Western society relationships, these patterns often follow behaviors that are based on gender. Through different discussion contexts, in a high school setting, we attempted see how the social network patterns and gender roles are influenced by discussion type. By videotaping a classroom's interactions in two different discussion formats, we evaluated the communications and behaviors between peers. Using social networking software, we were able to change complex human interactions into empirical data, and created maps of the interactions in the classroom. Analyzing the social network maps of the two separate discussions on the basis of gender, we worked to find out whether the physical format and framing of discussion affected gender roles and interactions in the classroom. We have shown that males dominate dialectic, polar discussions, while females are more outspoken in conversational, communal discussion types.

FROM AN ART TO A SCIENCE: IMPROVING THE SUBJECTIVE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCESS THROUGH AN ANALYTICAL METHOD TO OPTIMIZE DIVERSITY
Robert Weinstock Bamberger, Ari Sprung, 
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

One of the stated goals of colleges is to admit a highly diverse set of students based on criterion that go far beyond race and ethnicity. Colleges presently use a wide variety of techniques to select students for admission. These methods involve a degree of subjectivity. The purpose of the project was to create an analytical method, which would optimize diversity for a given set of eligible applicants. <br><br>An analytical method was developed and fifty trials were run. The analytical method went through a process in which it selected ten students from the hypothetical eligible set of thirty students. These results were compared against two control groups 1) a completely random selection and 2) a subjective selection process called the student test. The results were compared using two diversity measurements, Simpson’s Index of Diversity and the USA Today Method of Diversity. The analytical method was superior to the random control group using both measurements, and was superior to the student test using the USA Today’s Method of Diversity. However, a weakness to the analytical method was, although it generally improved diversity, it did so at the expense of maximizing student involvement. A second analytical method called the involvement method was then developed and tested to optimize diversity and involvement simultaneously. This method proved superior to both control groups in terms of diversity and the analytical method in consideration of student involvement.

ALCOHOL DISRUPTION: ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING PARADIGM AND DECISION MAKING TEST IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Hector E. Acaron, Juan R. Deliz, 
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, Miramar, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The Global Health Organization reported in 2002 that 69 percent of the global population consumes alcohol. In this study, the associative learning processes were defined by three stages: acquisition, integration, and retrieval. The British Journal of Addiction stated in 1990 that no study has demonstrated a relationship between conditioned responses and alcohol-related cues. This innovative empirical study used 1,420 Drosophila melanogaster as a model of human behavior to explain how ethanol interacts with the associative learning process. The fruit flies were introduced to determined ethanol concentrations along with an olfactory stimulus. They were submitted to a Pavlovian model of classical conditioning, where the flies made an association between the olfactory stimulus and a conditioned response. The flies were then transferred to a decision making test, in which observable behaviors identified perceptual responses. It was expected that this exposure during the training paradigm would limit consolidation and block memory access in the retrieval stage, suggesting possible learning relapse. T-tests were used to prove that ethanol did not affect the associative learning processes or decision making in low concentrations (0-3%). Nevertheless, high concentrations (3-6%) prolonged the physical recognition of the conditioned olfactory stimulus. Concentrations higher than 3.0% demonstrated a negative influence over the D. melanogaster’s behavior. There was no significant evidence that ethanol provoked learning relapse. Short-term exposure to ethanol places associative learning at risk of disruption. Ethanol exposure interrupted the first two stages of the associative learning process; nevertheless, once the olfactory information is integrated, its usage cannot be interrupted.

THE EFFECTS OF SSRI SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE FORMATION OF CONDITIONAL LONG TERM MEMORY IN DUNCE AND WILD TYPE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Peter Hans Massey, Claire Drago, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

The number of individuals diagnosed with memory disorders is doubling every five years (Neuro-Pro, 2005). Long term memory (LTM) is the retention of experience dependent internal representations over time (Kleinsmith et al., 95). Studies using various species have suggested that the formation of LTM reveals an increase in gene expression (Tully, 98). By testing activation of the CREB gene in flies the LTM process of the CREB switch was discovered (Tully, 98). Drosophila with higher levels of CREB need less training for efficient LTM formation (Tully, 83). The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of SSRI supplementation on the formation of LTM in Dunce and Wild Type Drosophila. The flies were subdivided into 4 groups, FLU supplemented Wild Type and Dunce, and two controls. Drosophila were olfactory trained with 3-Octanol using a protocol consisting of one minute 60V shock intervals with a ten minute rest. The standard interval consisted of 10 full trials however was shortened to 4 trials in prior experimentation. Drosophila were then tested for LTM four days post training using two scents the 3-octanol and 4-methylcyclohexanol, both found to be neutral in flies (Douglas and Tibaldi, 05). Data was recorded and placed in Excel. Statistical analysis by T-test (p<.05) was done to show significance between groups.

THE EFFECT OF VISUALLY ENHANCED MEDICINE LABELS ON RECALL ABILITY
Bradley Douglas Shields, Taylor McGraw, Reed Falkner
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Each year, thousands of people make mistakes when taking prescription medicine. This widespread problem prompted us to investigate the factors that lead to its prevalence. Research (as well as common sense) suggests that current medicine labels are not as conducive to accurate recall of instructions as they could be. In our study, we targeted this problem by seeking to improve existing medicine labels through the use of visual enhancements such as geometric figures and color symbols representing dosage instructions.<br><br>To test the effectiveness of these stimuli, we created three placebo pill bottles with the visually-enhanced labels and three with traditional text labels – both sets with comparable dosage instructions. We alternated which set we gave to the participants first. Participants were given a minute and a half to study the information on each label. After each study period, the participants recorded the instructions they remembered. We scored the tests based on the number of instructions recalled correctly. <br><br>We tested 30 people in all: 10 (18-24); 10 (45-55); 10 (65+) with an equal number of males and females in each group. On average, subjects recalled 68% of the instructions on the traditional text labels and 85% of the instructions on the visually-enhanced labels. The statistical increase was equally significant within each age group. As a general trend, younger subjects performed better on both tests. Statistical differences between males and females were not significant. <br><br>From our results, we have concluded that visual enhancements lead to more accurate recall of information on medicine labels.

THE EFFECT OF A SURPRISE ELEMENT IN A VIDEO ON THE HEART RATE OF ADOLESCENT HUMANS AND THE DIFFERENCE IN MALES AND FEMALES
Melissa Sandra Palmer, London Dewey, 
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of fear on the heart rate of adolescent humans using a startling image video.<br><br> First, 20 males and 20 females in high school were obtained and were given a survey to verify that they had a good heart condition. Then each subject was hooked up to the wireless heart rate monitor, and Logger Pro 4.3.6 software was used to measure their resting heart rate. Next, the subject watched the startling image video, and the peak heart rate from the LoggerPro software output was recorded. The average change in heart rate from resting to peak and the comparison between the average change of males and females using a t-test was found using Microsoft Excel. <br><br> The results were, indicated by a t-test, that there was a significant change on average of both genders' heart rates, but there was not a significant change when comparing males and females average heart rate.<br><br> It can be concluded that males and females are equally susceptible to an increased heart rate due to fear and have the same increase on average.

AN ANALYSIS OF REWARDS VS. PUNISHMENT SYSTEMS
Emily Jeanne Brinker, Rachel Kery, 
Northern High School, Owings, MD

In order to make students succeed in the classroom a number of classroom management strategies have been tried to increase student motivation and overall success. Of the myriad of methods tried, most rely on one of the three basic systems of operant conditioning: positive rewarding, negative rewarding, and punishment. In a positive rewards system, students are given the opportunity to win prizes (generally small trinkets or candy) in exchange for good behavior and academic success. In a negative rewards system, students are given the opportunity to “win” something negative taken away (i.e. a homework assignment, or a missed problem on a quiz), in exchange for academic success and general motivation. Finally in a punishment system the students are punished (with extra assignments, or harder quizzes) to prevent the repetition of the negative behavior. In this experiment, four high school U.S. history classes were assigned a system (positive, negative rewards, punishment, and control) and their overall academic success was surveyed over the course of several weeks. Our experiment found very little difference between the four methods (negative rewards, positive rewards, punishment, do nothing), and concludes that further research needs to be done to verify that any of these methods are the least bit effective in behavioral enhancement of high school students.

This is an exploratorian research in Victorino Simón neighbourhood in Concordia city, province of Entre Ríos, Argentina. It searches the social representation about maternity among women in poor areas, with “naturalized” and “fatalistic” character in relation to the attention to health they demand for the pregnancy, birth and puerperium stages and for the woman and child in general. Through it, we intend:<br><br>- To get to know the life conditions of low class people and the influence on their daily lives.<br><br>- To inquire into the social representations women have about maternity.<br><br>- To inquire into the type and frequency of the women’s visits to health centres.<br><br>We used as our method the interview in the depth to women with unsatisfied basic need and a semi-structures interview to women in the control group.<br><br>We conclude that this not-discerned maternity we had found along the investigation, we must recognize that poor women give, into their possibilities, medical attention to the pregnancy, birth and childhood.<br><br>The strength from a cultural command force women to have children and to be mothers. It’s an obligation the elements which have negative effects: a general disinformation, cultural distances from health professionals and economic obstacles, and administrative. On the contrary, in the control group belong to another social level, the maternity vision is not “naturalized” women demand and receives a more integral and coherent medical attention, according with her view.<br><br>We suggest overcoming strategies to problematic situation detects, suggesting an interdisciplinary work, from the resilience approach.

The effect of video games on the human brain has not been researched a considerable amount. Therefore, the purpose of our experiment was to determine out of two different types of video games, which one would most significantly effect short-term memory and visual comprehension of elderly and adolescent females.<br><br> Six elderly and adolescent females were chosen to participate in the experiment, females were chosen over males because women are less likely to be exposed to video games. The participants were tested with a block design, recommended by our school's Diagnostician. The participants played Halo (FPS) or Tetris (Puzzle). The time schedules are as follow: 1. Test Only (Control); 2. 25 minutes, 3 days/week; 3. 40 minutes, 3 days/week. Participants played for four full weeks, then took a final test.<br><br> The test was based on a 0 to 71 scoring system. Both groups' first test scores ranged from 26 to 56. Participants in both age groups have shown surprising results on their final tests. The scores have increased by up to 22 points on the First Person Shooter and Puzzle type video games. <br><br> From experimental results, both games have helped improve the participants' test scores, but in terms of which type of game increased their visual comprehension and short-term memory most significantly, the FPS had the most significant effect on their visual comprehension and short-term memory.

STEREOTYPES: AS SEEN ON TV
Veronika Nicole Biskis, Meghan Luther, 
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, HI

The purpose of this project was to determine whether common stereotypes are taken seriously and found offensive by high school students. The various gender and racial stereotypes differed in how they affected males and females. The clips used all came from a public site, and reflected the contemporary media. As such, many of the teenagers had been exposed to these particular clips or similar ones prior to experimentation.<br><br>The clips used respectively were as follows: a skit from the Dave Chappelle Show, a segment from Jay Leno's Tonight Show, an American Idol season III audition, a Mad TV sketch, two scenes from South Park, Miss Teen USA's response to a misunderstood question, the music video for "White and Nerdy" by Weird Al Yancovic, and a Fox News debate.<br><br>The survey distributed to students had two control questions for each clip. They were, "On a scale of one to ten," how funny and how offensive were the clips? Also, questions were formulated around the nature of each individual clip. For example, after showing the Dave Chappelle sketch, which depicted common stereotypes about Middle Easterners, African Americans, Caucasians and Native Americans, the question followed, "How accurately does the clip reflect modern day depiction of American society?"<br><br>Statistical analysis showed that in most cases there was a significant difference between male and female answers. Also, as seen in the charts, many questions veered toward a specific end of the spectrum, given as 1-4, 5-6 or 7-10. It was found that teenagers thought stereotypical and racial humor was not offensive, and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously.

DEPRESSION OR RECESSION? AN ANALYSIS OF PEOPLES' RESPONSES TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS
Kevin Michael Knight
Collegiate High School, Niceville, FL

103 people in Niceville, FL between the ages of 18 and 78 were surveyed about the economic crisis of 2008 during the course of my study. My hypotheses were that a majority of people would not feel well informed about the crisis, would feel the crisis was likely to directly impact them in the near future, and that they would have confidence in the government's ability to improve the economy. I also hypothesized that older subjects (age 40 and older) would feel more informed, have more concern about the crisis, and take more preventative measures in response to the crisis than younger individuals (aged 18-39).<br><br> My results indicate that 68% of subjects did not feel well informed about the crisis. 86% believed the crisis would impact them in the near future. 88% had confidence in the government's ability to improve the economy. 90% of individuals aged 18-39 did not feel well informed about the crisis, compared to 45% of subjects aged 40 and older. 71% of younger subjects showed concern about the crisis, compared to 91% of those aged 40 and older. 65% of subjects under 40 had taken at least two preventative measures in response to the crisis, compared to 72% of subjects over 40.<br><br> In conclusion, all my hypotheses were supported by the data collected.

THE EFFECTS OF TEXT FORMATTING ON COMPREHENSION LEVELS OF STRUGGLING AND ON-LEVEL READERS: A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Lindsey Brooke Saunders
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what effects formatted text and unformatted text have on comprehension levels of on-level readers and struggling readers. A test group of 120 students, 30 from each of grades 2 through 5, was used. From the 30 students in each grade, 15 were labeled struggling readers after scoring in the lower 25% of their grade level on the FCAT or SAT10 test. The remaining 15 were labeled on-level readers. Four grade level reading passages were used for each of the grade levels tested. Two of the passages were typed using a different format from the original. The formatted passages had sentences that were broken down into smaller segments of no more than 30 characters per line. Varied line indentions were used for the beginning of each line. The remaining two passages were retyped using justified margins and single line spacing. Eight comprehension questions were chosen for each passage. Each student silently read each passage and answered the questions that followed. The results showed that mean scores from all grade levels of on-level readers tested had a 9% increase by using formatted text passages. Struggling readers had a 14% increase using formatted text. From these results it can be concluded that using a formatted text pattern in reading passages increases reading comprehension of both on-level and struggling readers.

HOW SELF-ESTEEM MODERATES PERCEPTION OF INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM PERFORMANCE IN STUDENT ATHLETES AND MUSICIANS
Claire Elizabeth Yarnell Gamino
Temple High School, Temple, TX

In this study, 54 high school students involved in extra-curricular activities (i.e. marching band and varsity athletics) were interviewed in an attempt to discover if self-esteem moderates perception of both individual and team performance. It was predicted that the higher the individual’s self-esteem, the higher self-imposed expectations that would take greater effort to meet, causing the student to be less satisfied with a partially-successful performance than someone of a lower self-esteem. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient test (“Pearson R”) was run using the self-esteem and appraisal of team scores of musicians and yielded a mildly positive relationship that was not statistically significant, but merits further study. The Pearson R for athletes demonstrated an inverse relationship as predicted, but was not statistically significant. The Student’s “t” tests yielded no significant difference between the musicians and athletes either in self-esteem or perception of performance. The text data yielded a few interesting common themes. The musicians tended to feel the band was lazy and uncommitted, and the athletes felt the team’s chemistry was incompatible. Even though there was not a correlation between the self-esteem and team score, or a significant difference between the athletes’ and musicians’ self-esteem and perception, this test demonstrated the variability of people and their views of the same issues.

MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTING: A REVIEW OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT TEST-TAKING EFFECTIVENESS
Amanda Gabriela Barillas
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of the experiment was to test factors that are involved in multiple-choice tests. The first variable tested was "Comparing Test Media". 100 people were given one copy of each test: one on the computer and one traditional "bubble" exam. The second variable was "Strategy vs Nonstrategy". To test this, each person was given a twenty question exam: the first ten questions were to be answered without the strategy and the second ten were answered using the strategy provided (process of elimination). The third case was to test the "Discouraged Random Guessing" Method. Microsoft Excel randomly simulated 10,000 tests. The probability of getting an A, B, and C when eliminating none, one and two of the choices were calculated. The last variable tested was "Visual Bias due to Position". Using the method provided by "Deal or No Deal", 100 people were asked to pick one "case" out of six in a diagram (three different diagrams: linear, block and a circular clockwise). After the results were recorded, it was seen that there was a significant difference (9.6 >> 1.96) between scores on paper and computer. The strategy greatly aided the test taker, with a similar difference to that of the first case. Randomly guessing can render most likely a C when one eliminates two of the choices (5%). There was a particular bias towards the center of the layout, if there was one. This experiment could be improved with more people's results and more exams. The hypotheses were confirmed in all cases.

TOUCH – TECHNOLOGY OF MAKING TACTILE PICTURES AND AIDS FOR BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED PRESCHOOL CHILDREN
Natalia Butina
Municipal School # 44, Nizhny Novgorod, RUSSIA

Emotional and perceptible development of blind and partially unsighted preschool children finds difficulties due to an absence of books and aids assisting them to overcome this psychical lag. The comparison of existing technologies demonstrated that usually they acquaint child with contour of an object and its relief but provide a little perceptive characteristics. Young children perceive better the pictures with separate fragments of texture applique. <br><br> I decided to develop technology of making tactile pictures having both visual and tactile similarity with an object thus waking up senses and emotions. I made illustrations in the book where each image is completely made of materials with different textures. The selection of textures was made thoroughly with the aim to reproduce perceptive and tactile characteristics of image object. Various types of synthetic furs, textile, cardboard, paper, foil, natural materials etc. were used. It is also necessary to assure that object is perceived as an integral one, number of fine elements should not be very large.<br><br> The produced book was delivered to defectologists to study its recognizability. This study has demonstrated the advantage of technology of complete multitexture applique in making pictures for preschool children because such pictures are interesting and comprehensive; they are tactile-cognate and acquaint children with contour and shape of an object; it gives perceptive and emotional image; it also acquaints children with non-verbal communications. For children with residual sight picture can be also recognized by color because little details don’t merge with contour. Method allows blind and partially sighted preschool children overcoming psychical lag of and assisting in their perceptive and emotional development.

MUBSTAR PROGRAM TO COMMUNICATION FOR DEAF
Ahmad Rasmi Almubiden
Modern Systems Schools, Amman, JORDAN

There is in every society a special category requiring a special adaptation to the environment where they live are the deaf. Modern science has failed to make the deaf person part of the community, where there is no book in the world talking about the deaf, but we find the word "deaf community", the word with all the meanings of isolation experienced by the deaf.<br><br>On the basis of this problem the idea of the Mop Star was developed to make the deaf communicate where the program provides sufficient flexibility and capacity to make the deaf communicate across the world provided by the program is to enable deaf people to communicate across the world and this makes the deaf get out from the narrow range and go for the exchange of experiences and knowledge with the deaf in the world.<br><br>This program contains a very simple user interface that they can deal with it simply and with great flexibility since the program contains a graphical user interface to facilitate dealing with them.<br><br>The idea of how the program work is very simple that they can send and receive signals between the two parties and the process itself is the communication between the deaf.

ONLINE GAMES' IMPACT ON PERSONALITY OF SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Thao Ngoc Phan
Duc Trong High School, Duc Trong, Lam dong, VIETNAM

The research aims at understanding the impact of Online Games on high school students’s personality and their study results.<br><br>Research method: questionnaire , interview, observation, collecting data from recorder books.<br><br>Collected data: Regarding high-intensive players, the natural and social needs such as eating and sleeping remarkably reduce (38%)<br><br>Highlighting my self-centered tendencies, the need for being respected remarkably increases.<br><br>The interest of high intensive players in learning is much less than low intensive ones (31% reduced).<br><br>Computing skills are better and English knowledge is deeper <br><br>Regarding learning and other daily duties : the best effort rate for the work by students who spend much more time playing games is much lower than that by other (representing a decrease of 63%), the number of students who spend much more time playing games and tend to refuse or do not want to work is much higher than that of those spending less time playing (representing an increase of 31%).<br><br>Regarding the behaviour towards other people: Pay little care about other people, be more indifferent, irresponsible <br><br> Conclusion: The time students spend playing Online Games has a great effect on their personality and study results. If they spend 4 hours playing every day, they’ll lose their interest in study and become more inactive and bad tempered. Playing Online Games is not only money and time consuming but also makes student players neglect their study.

A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT: NATURE VERSUS NATURE IN CHESS
Ajit A. Vakharia
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

A Scientific American article in 2006 examined studies of chess grandmasters’ mental processes and concluded that experts were "made," not "born." The purpose of this project was to examine the relative contribution of intensive training ("nurture") and innate ability ("nature") on expertise development in chess and to explore how their impact differed. <br><br> Publicly available data for 174 expert chess players between ages 13 and 18 was collected. It included their current chess rating, starting rating, rating after first five tournaments, number of tournaments played, and years of tournament play. The dependent variable was rating change (current - starting rating); the independent variables included rating change after first five tournaments ("nature"), and number of tournaments played ("nurture"); while the control variable was years of tournament play. Correlation, regression, and curve-fitting methods were used for data analysis. <br><br> The results showed that nature and nurture contributed equally to expertise development in chess, although nature dominated when including the control variable. The impact of nurture on rating change was modeled as a concave function while the impact of nature was an S-shaped function. After grouping experts into those with higher versus lower innate ability, rating change was significantly higher for the former as compared to the latter when both played in a large number of tournaments. <br><br> This study concluded that in developing expertise nurture can, up to a point, counter the dominating influence of nature, and that for chess players with high innate ability, expertise was magnified when complemented with high levels of nurturing.

LEARNING STYLES: SUBSTANTIATING THE THEORY THAT LEARNING STYLES ENHANCE EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BY ANALYZING VAK SURVEYS AND INDIVIDUAL LEARNING STYLE ASSESSMENTS
Travis Coleman Sigafoos
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

My research project on learning styles is intended to help students understand how they learn best. Students usually learn according to how their teacher presents the information. However, not all students learn the same, and what works for one may not work for another. That is why educating individuals about learning styles can help students discover their best study methods, and can increase their school performance. I utilized a VAK survey to find student’s learning style preference. Then, I used individual learning styles assessments (ILSA), which showed the student’s application of each learning style. The learning styles used in this experiment are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. The goal was to measure the application of a student’s learning style by having them memorize as much of a poem as they can. Data analysis showed that seven t-tests had statistical confidence, ranging near (p=0.05)-(p=0.01) which shows that my tests were consistent. Also, 1/5 of students had a VAK survey to LSA relationship match, where the VAK surveys are in direct correlation to the LSA. Thus shows that (13/65) students use their complete learning style preference. This process is crucial because, some scholars disagree with learning styles. I found that learning styles are significant, and 1/5 of students use their entire preference. I have set a strong foundation for year one of my project, and I plan to do a continuation by having a class find their learning styles in class, and monitor their academic progress.

A DERMATOGLYPHIC CORRELATION TO WORK ETHIC
Louise Frances Johnson
Terrebonne High School, Houma, LA

The purpose of this project is to determine whether there is a correlation linking dermatoglyphics and work ethic. Fingerprints (dermatoglyphics) will be analogous in each category dealing with work ethic. To test whether this correlation exists or not, a random sampling of 122 students was taken. Before the sampling could begin, however, human subject forms needed o be distributed and collected. Then, a survey containing different questions concerning G.P.A and work ethic was administered. The subject then took their right thumb and rolled it into the ink pad provided for them. They then placed their thumb at the bottom of the survey to give their fingerprint. This was repeated until the print was clear enough to classify. Once the students were finished, the surveys with the fingerprints were collected and then analyzed for any possible correlation. Analysis of the results revealed that there is indeed a correlation linking dermatoglyphics and work ethic. People who have a loop pattern have a tendency to maintain an A average. They are most likely to be enrolled in regular classes, and their work ethic is directed toward extra-curricular activities. People who possess a whorl pattern have a tendency to have a C average. They are most likely to be enrolled in gifted classes, and their work ethic is directed toward work outside of school. People who have an arch pattern have a tendency to retain a B average. They are most likely to be enrolled in honors classes and their work ethic is directed toward school work.

FATAL DISTRACTION
Lauren Elizabeth Dearmond
H. L. Bourgeois High School, Gray, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to comparae the affects of talking to a passinger while driving to that of talking on a cell phone, I was hoping to be able to conclude whether talking to a passenger was more, less, or equally hindering to the driver's ability as talking on a cell phone while driving. My hypothesis was that the driver's driving ability would be affected even more when they talked on the cell phone.<br><br> To test my hypothesis I used a racing video game and a steering wheel controller. The test subjects drove three rounds while talking on a cell phone, three rouds while talking to a passenger, and three rounds with no distractions. I recorded each time the test subjects ran off the road and ran into another car.<br><br> A majority of the time, subjects drove better talking to the passenger than on a cell phone, with some exceptions. I observed that people who stated they talked on the cell phone while driving often were often less distracted by the cell phone than everyone else.<br><br> I concluded that a majority of the time driving with a cell phone is more hindering to the driver's abilities. However, drivers should be cautious when talking to a passenger because it can be equally hindering to the driver's ability, if not more, depending on the level of concentration demanded by the conversation

PREDICTING BIOBEHAVIORAL LINKS BETWEEN NURTURING AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH MODEL SPECIES, RATTUS NORVEGICUS
Ashlee Nicole Sharer
Wayne County High School, Jesup, GA

a) The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the lack of nurturing would impair intellectual development and problem solving skills of a model species, Rattus norvegicus. By studying model species, one can produce predictions of how similar behavior would be displaying in humans. <br><br>b) Construct a Morris Water Maze. Collect four specimens and subject them to the water maze to create a baseline. Collect two rats as control and two as tested; house in separate cages under controlled conditions. Phase A: The tested pair will be nurtured for two weeks, thirty minutes daily. At the end of two weeks, all four specimens are subject to maze testing pattern every other day. Phase B: At the end of week four, the two controls will receive nurturing sessions to view the potential “catch-up” factor of the hippocampus. Report results.<br><br>c) The average baseline time was 125.94 seconds. End Phase A: the control group displayed an average time of 114.53 seconds, and the nurtured a time of 78.15 seconds. End Phase B: the nurtured group showed an average final time of 39.3 seconds and the control an average of 80.12 seconds (comparable to Phase A of nurtured.)<br><br>d) In conclusion, my hypothesis stated that while I believed nurturing would have a significant effect on model species, the catch-up phenomenon would not be present in my testing. After completing experimentation, my hypothesis was correct for Phase A of experimentation, but incorrect for Phase B; Rattus norvegicus do show significant catch-up rates.

LEARNING, NATURALLY - DOES A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ENHANCE LEARNING?
Trevor Will van Voorthuijsen
Prospect Christian Homeschool, Lecanto, FL

The purpose of this study was to determine if students learn the Dolch Basic Sight Vocabulary Words more effectively when taught in a natural outdoor setting. Sixteen randomly chosen first grade students from two classes received identical tutoring of 25 Dolch words; eight students remained indoors while eight studied outdoors. Most tutoring sessions opened with an animal/plant encounter; the Dolch words were presented incorporating Gardner's Multiple Intelligences using various games and activities. The hypothesis of the study was that the subjects meeting outdoors would retain more sight words than those taught indoors.<br><br> A pre-test was administered to each child to determine known words, so the post-test would reflect words learned. Each tutoring session was 15 minutes long twice weekly for 10 weeks. Individual bi-weekly tests were given.<br><br> From Class A, the "inside" group learned 72% of the words taught, while the "outside" group gained 83%. Given those learned words, the inside subjects retained 78%; the outside set had a retention rate of 91%. Class B's inside students gained 61% of the tutored list, whereas the outside group recognized 71%. Upon testing for retention, the inside group scored 88%, and the outside group 93%.<br><br> According to this study, the subjects instructed in a natural environment retained more recognition of the sight words than those within the conventional classroom setting. It showed that a basic skill such as word recognition was enhanced by outdoor instruction. Current educational practices and theories may need to be re-examined to include natural settings for learning.

MULTITASKING: DOES CELL PHONE USE AFFECT PERFORMANCE?
Eric Bonnefil Van Dyk
Winston Churchill High School, San Antonio, TX

This experiment was inspired by media attention to multitasking and its effect on driving. It was designed to test whether a hands-free cell phone device would be distracting in a simulated driving situation. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) Subjects given a “distraction” on a simulated driving task have impaired performance; 2) Younger subjects are more distracted when using a hands-free cell phone device than older subjects because of a lack of driving experience; 3) Females perform better than males when distracted because “females are better at multitasking”. Each subject performed a computerized version of a cognitive task (Stroop task) and a simulated driving task with and without distraction. Reaction times were analyzed using 3-way ANOVA. Age and gender were compared for susceptibility to distraction. Results for the Stroop task provided validation of the hands-free cell phone distraction: all four groups (Younger Females, Younger Males, Older Females, Older Males) showed significantly impaired performance (p<0.0001). Older subjects were more distractible than younger subjects (p<0.0014). Results for the driving task indicated that females performed significantly slower than males overall (p<0.01). Significant impairment of “driving” performance due to hands-free cell phone distraction was observed in Older Females (p<0.0115). Younger Males and Older Males showed non-significant impaired performance during cell phone distraction. This experiment demonstrates that hands-free cell phone distraction does impair performance in both tasks. To see further significant effects in the driving task, a larger number of subjects may need to be tested and a longer “driving” time may be required.

ANALYSIS OF EYE CONTACT AND DRIVING TIME ON A SIMULATED DRIVING DEVICE: CRAZY TEXTING WHILE DRIVING
Chee Xiong
Como Park Senior High School, St. Paul, MN

TWD or texting while driving is a serious problem that has been increasingly growing worse. Billions of text messages and cell phone calls are sent in the United States each year and it seems that the amount of electronic distractors is growing. Many people drive while having cell phone conversations, text messaging, listening to an iPod, or entering address information into a global positioning device. Teen drivers are most prone to using these devices. Many feel they can successfully drive while doing so and are against any legislation opposing their use while driving. I surveyed 450 people twelve and older to assess where and how often they text, who they see texting while driving and attitudes about texting while driving, legal aspects and ability to text without looking. I found a relationship between age and three activities. For subjects I measured the amount of eye contact, driving time and maximum speed while operating a driving simulator under normal day time conditions and while texting. I found a negative linear relationship for texting while driving with age. With and without texting, I also found 48% difference in means in amount of eye contact and a 13% difference in means in the driving time. My observation results correlated positively with the literature review.

VIOLIN OR VOICE... BRAIN FOOD FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS?
Skye Nicole Singleton
Bartlesville Mid-High, Bartlesville, OK

This experiment aimed to discover if playing the violin increases Alzheimer’s patients’ appetites and overall happiness as much or more than singing. Research was done on Alzheimer’s disease, memory, music’s affect on memory, and the brain in order to understand key components of the experiment, as well as to enhance the experiment’s capacity to target the major complications that those with Alzheimer’s disease experience; complications include loss of memory and loss of ability to do simple, everyday tasks. With the permission of the local assisted living facility, the control group of sixteen patients, which was the same as the experimental group, was set up. The control group’s behavior and appetite was observed first for eight visits at their dinnertime from 5:00-5:30 using observation guidelines devised for this experiment. The guidelines consisted of positive/negative questions as well as a question on the percentage of meal eaten. This process was repeated with the experimental group except that six songs were played on the violin for half of the dinnertime. Then, questions from the observation guideline were separated into positive/negative categories and averaged accordingly. Their overall appetite increased by thirteen percent, which was the same result as with singing. This result is not significant, and it is not determinable as to which form of music increases appetite more. However, playing the violin increases their appetite by twenty-seven percent, which is thirteen percent more than singing did.

FUN & GAMES: A STUDY OF RATIONAL BEHAVIOR IN INDIVIDUALS THROUGH COGNITIVE REFLECTIONS TESTING AND PREDICTIONS OF NASH EQUILIBRIUM IN N-PERSON GAMES
Catherine Susan Haag
Beaumont School, Cleveland Heights, OH

This project determines if individuals with higher cognitive ability, a rational, reflective way of thinking, behave more closely to John Nash’s predictions of equilibrium in n-person games than individuals with less cognitive ability. Groups of participants were gathered in separate locations and given Dr. Shane Frederick’s three-question Cognitive Reflections Test as a measure of cognitive ability; all three questions have intuitive wrong answers and a right answer which requires more reflection. Those who answer two or three questions correctly have more cognitive ability than those who answer one or zero questions correctly. <br><br>Participants then guess a number from 0 to 100 in a five-trial game based on John Keynes’ Beauty Contest concept. Prior to the game they are told they will win if their guess equals two-thirds of the average of the group’s guesses. Rational thinkers would guess zero assuming their group contains other rational thinkers who would simultaneously guess zero. If every guess is zero, everyone wins and no player has incentive to change his strategy; Nash equilibrium forms.<br><br>The hypothesis was proven incorrect because those individuals who answered two or three questions correctly on the test did not always guess progressively lower numbers throughout the game’s five trials, and did not always get closer to guessing zero. This can be attributed to the inadequate sample size. The results of this experiment should encourage schools everywhere to focus on development of stronger cognitive ability in students.

THE EFFECTS OF EQUINE ASSOCIATION ON THE INITIAL BENEFICIARY AND BENEFACTOR
Katlin Jayne Hornig
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if horse and human association can aid in decreasing the negative effects of stress and anxiety, both mentally and physically. This will be done by analyzing the reaction of both horses and humans during three different thirty minute therapeutic sessions. Stress and anxiety levels will be evaluated for human and horse as well as vital counts. This research will include various types of individuals. Each individual will be paired with a horse of mild temperament. They will be required to participate in three sessions, each time practicing a different method of equine association. Prior to commencement and conclusion of their session, each individual will complete various questionnaires, read safety and procedural protocols, and have their vitals taken to determine the benefits or lack thereof. The horse will be evaluated in a similar manner. <br><br> After testing these horse/human pairs I found amazing results. Over 80% of all horses and humans involved in these sessions experienced a decrease or a regulation of his/her vitals. In general, I found that horses and humans both benefit mentally, emotionally, and physically from association. Aberrant and troubled individuals appear to have the greatest positive influence from their equine encounter. This research is already allowing horses to be implemented in police departments and correctional facilities for stress management and therapeutic/treatment programs. I am glad to see its current contribution and am working toward furthering its usage.

IS THE TASTE OF COLOURED FOOD DRINKS REAL OR IMAGINARY?
Mayokun Oluwagbenga Gogo
Homat Private Schools, Lagos, West Africa, NIGERIA

The present study was based upon the hypothesis that the taste of coloured food drinks may be more imaginary than real and that judgement regarding taste or flavour is at least partly influenced by colour. To test this hypothesis, twelve (12) food packs numbered 1 to 12 were each filled with 30g of sugar in 250ml of water. In addition, food colourings (Rose pink, Orange, Green and Chocolate) were added to packs 1 – 4, respectively. Packs 5 through 8 had colourings and food flavours mixed-up in them without matching the colours with flavours. Packs 9 - 12 contained flavours (Strawberry, Orange, Lemon and Chocolate) with their peculiar colours (as stated above). Ten students tasted the 12 samples. The volunteers ate crackers in between the samples to clear off previous flavours.<br><br>The results showed that food colour influenced perceived food flavour as 50% of students spontaneously assumed the flavours on the basis of colours. Only 30% could identify the flavours in different colours. However, 62.5% were able to identify the taste correctly when appropriate colours were matched with their characteristic flavours. It was also observed that green colouring and orange flavour combined to form a drink most preferred. <br><br>This suggests that young people just take any food coated with attractive colours and many times assume flavour on the basis of colour. The study further underscores the need for regulatory bodies to ensure that the content vis-à-vis colouring, flavour, other ingredients and their amounts are satisfactorily safe.

EFFICACY OF PEER-DELIEVERED SLEEP HYGIENE EDUCATION ON SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES, SLEEP QUALITY, AND MOOD IN EVENING-TYPE ADOLESCENTS
Elliot E.A. Prince
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, OR

Evening-type adolescents are at greatest risk for inadequate sleep hygiene and quality and for depressed mood. This study aims to determine relationships between sleep and mood, and to examine the effectiveness of sleep hygiene education in evening-type adolescents under two differing demand conditions. The hypotheses were: 1) If evening-type adolescents receive peer-delivered sleep hygiene education, then they will improve on measures of sleep hygiene, sleep quality, and mood under a condition of high demand (final exams); and 2) There will be a significant relationship between evening chronotype and mood. These hypotheses were tested in a sample of 24 subjects using a rigorously controlled block design (experimental group n=13; control group n=11) with two phases. The first condition (baseline) was low-demand which occurred during a school break (7 free days). The second condition (follow-up) was high-demand which occurred during school final exams (4 school days, 4 free days). The results supported part of the first hypthesis: the experimental group improved in sleep quality (p value less than .05). The second hupothesis was also supported as relationships between sleep hygiene and quality were established with mood (negative correlation, p value less than .05) and eveningness was associated with mood (negative correlation, p value less than .01). These data suggest that evening-type adolescents are optimal candidates for sleep hygiene education as a way to improve sleep and mood.

TWO UNIVERSAL LANGUAGES: MUSIC AND MATH
Mary Patricia Rougeau
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

The purpose of this science experiment is to see if there is any correlation between Algebra test scores and genres of music. Many colleges have done studies involving Education and Music and/or other factors. Such as the Hariot Watt University, who performed a test involving music affecting the taste of wine. It concluded that the genre of music played effected how the subjects taste toward the wine was. <br><br> To complete this experiment, Part One and Part Two of the exam both consisted of ten Algebra 1 questions and ten Algebra 2 questions. A survey was created with 9 questions about the exam and the music played. Three different genres were selected and three different CDs were made for each one. Subjects were given the exam and answer sheet and given instructions for both Parts. The music began playing, and the subjects had ten minuets for Part 1 after ten minutes, working on Part 1 closed, and then the ten minuets for Part 2 began. When the time for Part 2 ended, the subjects were given the survey to complete. <br><br> From taking the exams and finding the averages and matching those to the answers on the survey, many conclusions can be made. When comparing average scores to any genre, the scores while listening to music were higher than the average with out music; it occurred with every genre. Though many of the answers on the survey differed, the average score while listening to music was the higher than the average score with out music, for every question.

EXPRESSION PROJECT: YOUTH AND CULTURE INTEGRATED
Marina Matias Corte
Colegio Coracao de Maria, Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The young people are, every day, surrounded by information, motivation and influences. This project had two main objectives: check these influences, which often have been the base of the young taste for art in general, and bring the ways of cultural expression towards the young people of Esteio city. It was developed in the pilot school, with artistic programming: theatre presentation, film related to the national culture, and daily cultural expression of the young people that live in Esteio city. Following the methodology, it was selected a public school. Which served as a research field and actions. This choice was based on fact that this school has no cultural activities, as student’s theatre group, for example. In order to obtain percentage and more detailed information, questionnaires were applied to students of six schools in Esteio: five public schools and one private. School, so that more than one "tribe" of young people were integrated in the research. Workshops were established with students surveyed, with the goal of narrowing the huge gap that often exists between the young and art. The project aims, beyond analyzing the young and their relations with society, culture and the art, change the view that the youngster has about cultural expression, because the culture contributes to social relationships, the self-esteem, leisure, and the intellect of young people.

This project is the result of the perception made on the path taken by some pieces of knowledge as they become forgotten, and thus, can be classified as epistemic losses.<br><br>Our hypothesis that the technological development and the consequential paradigm shifts (Kuhn, 1970) were the only factors responsible for this phenomenon, was partially confirmed. <br><br>The bibliography review on the evolution of Physics allowed us to characterize the process of paradigm shift. And, through an analysis of a specific case of epistemic loss - the Brachistochrone – we could testify in which circumstances the discontinuation of a concept can be not only a conceptual problem, but also a practical problem. <br><br>Epistemic losses were also approached in another context. Technical and scientific knowledge is abandoned by the cultural domination of a nation upon another. <br><br>In mathematics, the kind of research which tries to find this type of knowledge forms an area called Ethnomathematics. We selected two examples of epistemic losses rescued by Ethnomathematics: the Angolan sand drawings, or sona, and the accounting system of the Incas, the khipus.<br><br>Our hypothesis was amplified with the incorporation of those culturally originated epistemic losses, and the analysis led us to two central ideas:<br><br>Despite the continuous development in scientific knowledge, mankind is systematically less practical and economic. Simple solutions are being replaced by complex and expensive ones.<br><br>We could also notice a contradiction between a world that is more and more crowded, but at the same time with fewer perspectives: a world of a unique paradigm.

DOES THE AGE AND GENDER AFFECT THE ABILITY TO REMEMBER INFORMATION? PHASE III: IMAGES VS. WORDS
Hans Christian Jetter
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this experiment was to determine, if words were recalled more than images. A sample of 100 human subjects divided into 5 groups of 20 people, 10 males and 10 females ages 10 to 59 years old divided in age groups covering a ten year span. Every human subject was tested using the same picture containing the 20 different words representing the objects of the two previous examinations. The subjects were exposed to the test for 30 seconds and then it was hid from them. They had one minute to write the items recalled. The results showed that females in the ages 30-39 years old were able to remember the highest amount of items (9.2 words average). Females were able to constantly remember more words than males. These results are consistent with previous examinations (color and black & white objects). Males remembered more items up to the age of 29 years (pinnacle 9.1 items in this age group). The variable of color and to have changed the objects for words has proven that these variables have an impact in the persons’ ability to remember information. The word recalled the most was the butterfly by 72% of the participants. The word written first the most was the butterfly, recalled by 35% of the participants. The words recalled the least were the guitar, telephone and plant, each recalled by 22% of the participants. The word written last the most was the chair, recalled by 10% of the participants.

HOW SCARY IS TOO SCARY? THE EFFECT OF FEAR APPEALS IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING
Geetika Rudra
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Research (Witte, 1992) has established, through the Extended Parallel Process Model, that fear appeals in health advertising typically need to create high levels of response efficacy, self-efficacy, and perceived threat to persuade an audience. However, although fear appeals are a popular strategy in political campaigns today, no studies were found that investigated how such variables collectively affect the success of political fear appeals. One hundred and ninety-two high school seniors were randomly assigned to read one of eight versions of a political fear appeal sponsored by a hypothetical presidential candidate. Participants were asked to rate the likelihood they would support the candidate, their perceived self-efficacy, their perceived response efficacy, and their perception of terrorism as a threat. Fear appeals with a high level of response efficacy resulted in a greater likelihood to support the candidate. Fear appeals with a high level of of threat led participants to rate terrorism as more of a threat and to express greater self efficacy in terms of believing their vote could help the candidate win the election. This study suggests that political candidates should employ fear appeals with high levels of response efficacy to convince people to vote for them and high levels of threat severity to mobilize the electorate and maximize message acceptance.

THE IMPACT OF GRADE-LEVEL AND GENDER ON HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS SELF-REGULATED LEARNING STRATEGIES
Nicole Traci Goldbaum
Plainview Old-Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

The social cognitive theory of Bandura has provided the theoretical basis for the development of a model of self-regulated academic learning in which personal, contextual, and behavioral factors interact in such a way to allow opportunity for students to exercise control over their own learning, while at the same time setting limits to self-direction. <br><br>The present three prong study first examines whether self regulated learning can be achieved in high school, and if so do older students make more use of self-regulated learning strategies than younger ones. The impact of gender and grade-point average will also be determined.<br><br>Ninth and twelfth grade students in an east coast, suburban, middle class high school completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), which was created by Pintrich in 1991. The MSLQ is a self-report instrument used to investigate student motivation and learning strategies. The MSLQ is scored with separate scales, each sensitive to different aspects of motivation and learning strategies. Statistical analysis, including t-tests and Pearson correlations, were performed on the data. Positive, significant correlations were found between GPA and the subscales of the MSLQ. These findings, confirming the literature, showed positive correlations between academic success and a student’s use of self-regulated learning strategies. Additionally, females surpassed the means of the males and the 12th graders surpassed the means of 9th graders on the subscales of the MSLQ. The differences between the means of these groups were found to be significant at the α = 0.05 level. These findings show that females are more self-regulated in their learning than males, and 12th graders are more self-regulated than 9th graders. Therefore, the data supported the theory of the evolution of self-regulated learning in adolescents through high school.

EXAMINING THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE RBANS FOR SPANISH SPEAKERS WITH EPILEPSY
Gabrielle Alexandra Young
Valley Stream South High School, Valley Stream, NY

Epilepsy is a neuronal condition in which there is a malfunction in the productivity of the electrical signaling within the brain. Many studies have suggested the use of neuropsychology in significantly aiding treatment. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a neuropsychological test given to diagnose patients who have neuropsychological disorders. This test is often used to diagnose problematic areas in the brains of epilepsy patients. However the clinical utility of the Spanish battery has been questioned as there has yet been a normative established. In this study the doctors at a comprehensive epilepsy center tested both 47 Spanish and 45 English speakers to collectively construct a normative. It was a blind data study and they received the complete RBANS consisting of 12 subtests. We then found that within the results there were statistical differences in the results of the subtests Language Index (F = 5.36), List Recall (F = 2.93), Picture Naming (F = 9.49), and Digit Span (F = 4.02). Each measured value had a p>.10, except for List Recall which had a p>.01. Possible reasons for these differences are factors such as difference in culture, word valence, and even the ability of adaptive reasoning skills. However there was also a presence of poor memory and naming skills, which is a trait consistent with people who have epilepsy. Although there were discrepancies within the results, the study proved that the Spanish RBANS can be utilized to help treatment of this population.

HOW HARRY POTTER CAN HELP YOU GET A HIGHER SAT SCORE: THE EFFECTS OF CONTEXT AND FAMILIARITY ON VOCABULARY RETENTION IN ADOLESCENTS
Trisha Paige Nussbaum
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

A great deal of educational research has focused on the effectiveness of different learning methods on improving standardized test scores in adolescents. “SAT Prep novels” have been developed as an attempt to utilize the positive effects of context on vocabulary retention. Two experiments were conducted to test the effect of context as well as familiarity on vocabulary learning and test performance in adolescents. The first experiment involved 129 eleventh grade students in a high school who were randomly assigned to learn common SAT vocabulary words in a list, in a narrative with an unfamiliar character, or in a narrative with a familiar character. The students were administered a sentence completion test in the same format as that found in the SAT examination which utilized the words they studied. An ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests demonstrated that those students who read a narrative about a familiar character scored better than either of the other two groups and that students who read a narrative scored better than students who studied from a list. The replication on 104 high school students in a college summer program also measured enjoyment of task and memory over time. An ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests demonstrated that students learned words present in context with a familiar character best, followed by unfamiliar character context and then by list format. Additionally, the second experiment demonstrated that the enhancement of vocabulary learning produced by familiar context persisted over a 5-day period. Interestingly, another ANOVA and set of post hoc tests showed that enjoyment did not have a significant impact on the relationship between study methods and test scores. These results not only confirm the generally accepted belief that vocabulary learning is enhanced if words are present in contextual format, but also that familiarity with the character in the context amplifies this effect.

NOT ALL WATER IS CREATED EQUAL: A CCOMPARISON OF BOTTLE VS. TAP.
Lissi Lizbet Welton
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Water directly effects how every human being lives their life. Where they live, what they eat, what clothes they wear. In essence, water is life. Unfortunately our water supplies are contaminated with chlorine, pesticides, arsenic, lead, and pharmaceuticals. Our current options are to find ultra purified waters. Reverse osmosis and vapor distillation are two purification systems that bottled water companies are currently using. The water coming from your tap is regulated by the EPA so that it is safe to consume. With so many bottled water companies using advertisements that promise “the best” water, how is one supposed to know what is best. This begs the question; can the human palate even discern between bottled and tap water? This is a comparative study of what the human palate chooses as their favorite and least favorite water type. Age, amount of water consumed in a day, typical type of water that is consumed (ie. bottled, tap, purified) and concern for contaminants are all compared to the general like and dislike of six different types of water. Three types of bottled water: Brand A from a spring, Brand B with electrolyte additives, and Brand C purified water from a municiple source, and three types of tap water; Hereford well, Sierra Vista and Tucson tap water. A survey and then a blind taste test of the six different waters were administered to sixty participants; twenty from each of three age groups: young adults, middle adults and older adults. It is hypothesized that the palates of the subjects will have the same ability to discern between water types, despite age difference. In theory all water should taste the same; therefore each sample group should show equal representation. After testing sixty participants it was found that there is a distinguishable difference in preference. While the favorite water varied, the clear least favorite was Tucson tap water. My research shows that the human palate can distinguish between different types of water. It is concluded, that not all water is created equal.

EXPLORING SCHIZOPHRENIC LOGIC WITH COMIC STRIPS
Shira Ahissar
Aharon Katzir High School, Rehovot, ISRAEL

Schizophrenia is thought to impair logical processes, but the nature of these impairments and whether there is any consistency across different individuals remain unresolved. To explore logical processes I created 4 comic strips, leaving the speech bubbles empty, and asked 19 schizophrenic patients and 11 normative subjects to fill the bubbles. I then asked each patient to grade each of the 19x4 filled comic strips according to how logical they are. In addition, I graded each filled comic strip according to 10 characteristic features. A cluster analysis of the combined data revealed 3 distinguished patient groups, showing different logical patterns. This grouping and several correlations between different characteristics of the filled comic strips indicated that schizophrenic logic may have its own rules. For example, the number of repetitions of "loneliness" words and the maximum number of pictures combined into one plot were significantly correlated. Indeed most breaks in the plots occurred at a dramatic event in the comic strip. Subsequent personal interviews revealed significant relationships between dramatic experiences the patients had and the characteristics of their filled comics. My findings indicate grouping of logical patterns among schizophrenics and suggest that schizophrenic logic deviates from the norm at events where that patient could not handle normative logic. These frequent breaks in plot may result from impaired connections between emotions, encoded in the limbic system, and memory for episodes, encoded in the hippocampus. This is consistent with impairments in frontal lobe control over limbic-hippocampus connections, which results in impaired emotional control of memory encoding.

GIRL`S CRUELTY
Evgeniya Mikhailovna Konovalova
Humanities-Pedagogical Liceym, Ukhta, Komi Republic, RUSSIA

The question of girl’s cruelty is one, which worries adults and teenagers. Girl’s aggression and cruelty increase in geometric progression. Experts think that it’s impossible to talk about spreading of feminism of teenager’s criminality. However the per cent of girl’s criminality increases every year and forms 8-10 % of total quantity of criminality.<br><br>Purposes of this work are: revealing factors, which help appearing and development of girl’s cruelty, learning reasons, which assist girl’s cruelty, finding differences between girl’s and boy’s cruelty.<br><br>Methods, which used in the work: learning scientific and publicistic articles, materials of Department of Home Affairs of Sosnogorsk in this problem, interviews with girls, holding psychological tests.<br><br>Teenager’s, in particular girl’s cruelty appears in the next transitional period in the life of society. People, who lose confidence on the future and who can’t feed their children, they neglect upbringing process.<br><br>At the present time a girl tries to self-affirm, so she looks like «a monster in skirt». In cartoons and films girls are able to fight, are master of art of fighting. Girls and women try to have the same rights as men, sometimes they want to manage them, so revaluation of values is happening. Now boys don’t try to get for girl’s attention, but girls fight for boy. Those girls create a family with difficulties in their future lives, they can’t be a woman-mother. Those girls aspire to individual leadership, don’t compromise.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF NATIVE LANGUAGE ON THE LEARNING STYLE OF NATIVE CHINESE AND NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS
Ling Chou
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Chinese was initially created based on the visual representation or pictographs of various objects and concepts while modern English was created by putting together phonic Western alphabets that do not contain any visual meaning. Languages can shape one’s thought process. If native Chinese speakers are more visual than native English speakers, then the P-value of Dimension Visual-Verbal should be significantly lower. Fifty four native English speakers, 18 bilingual students and 102 native Chinese speakers volunteered to complete the Index of Learning Styles based on the Felder-Silverman model, and an ANOVA test was then done to the raw data. The Index displayed learning style through four dimensions: Active-Reflective, Sensing-Intuitive, Visual-Verbal and Sequential-Global. The results showed that the P-values of each dimension were as follows: 0.000828, 0.147403, 1.94E-08 and 0.001658. In conclusion, significant differences in learning styles between Chinese, English and bilingual students were shown in VIS-VRB and SEQ-GLO. Chinese speakers were more visual and global. These findings may be applied in the education of foreign students; perhaps students with other visual native languages, such as Japanese, would show the similar results.

FACE RECOLLECTION: DEVELOPING A NOVEL TRAINING PROGRAM TO INCREASE RECOLLECTION RATES IN EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION
Lori Jeanine Schlatter
Camdenton High School, Camdenton, MO

Eyewitness misidentification of criminals is a very prevalent problem that needs to be solved. In researching this issue, many studies have found several trends in face recognition relating to eyewitness identification, including own-gender and own-race biases. <br><br>The purpose of this study was to create a novel computer program to train participants to recollect faces more accurately and consistently. 168 participants watched several original video clips with randomly generated faces superimposed over the actors’ faces. The participants were then asked to reconstruct two of the faces from four multiple choice feature questions. The experimental group was taught an original method of face recognition using the phrase “top-down, shape-width.” After the training portion, four more video clips were viewed followed by more reconstruction questions. Nine days later, the experimental group used a follow-up program with four more video clips to determine any long-term effects of training.<br><br>After examining the results of this study, it was concluded that this simple, novel training method is effective not only in short-term, but also long-term results, which is a potential breakthrough in eyewitness training. Though race and gender correlations were not significant, the overall scores significantly increased (P< .001) after training. The mean follow-up score was not significantly different from the post-training mean, demonstrating the long-term effectiveness of this training method. Considering the results of this study, it is plausible that use of this novel and systematic approach to increasing the accuracy of face recollection could be applied to reduce harmful errors in eyewitness identification.

WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON RACIAL PROFILING WHEN PRESENTING SUBLIMINAL IMAGES TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS.
Ariel Nicole Wiley
Basha High School, Chandler, AZ

Racial profiling is a major concern in American society, especially in areas such as law enforcement. However there is little information available on how to reduce racial profiling. Previous work has discovered that lips, hair, and eyebrows are most strongly linked to racial profiling. A simple random sample was used to select the candidate subjects for this study to test the hypothesis that, “Subliminal imaging can be used to reduce the frequency of racial profiling.” High School students of both genders and varied ethnicities were used to explore the impact of subliminal messaging on the conscious and subconscious mind. Faces that generated stereotypical responses were paired randomly with the same faces that had a change to their lips, hair or eyebrows. Subjects were initially shown a presentation where one facial characteristic was changed for a range of ethnic images. Subjects were then shown a four-minute presentation in which changes to those characteristics were flashed periodically for .01 seconds. They again responded to the initial survey to determine if subliminal imaging impacted their responses. The P value for a matched pairs T – Test was .000000000001850404 indicating that the subliminal messaging made a significant difference in the subjects’ tendencies to stereotype. This study indicates that subliminal messaging may be an effective tool in identifying and mitigating peoples’ tendencies to racially stereotype. Future research is needed to more fully assess the impact of subliminal messaging on racial profiling.

POSSIBLE VARIANCE IN SCORES ON THE MISSOURI ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (MAP) COMMUNICATION ARTS TEST BASED ON ENGLISH DIALECT SPOKEN
Daniel Alexander Duncan
St. Charles West High School, St. Charles, MO

The Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) standardized tests seek to quantify the ability of students across a wide geographical area. Students’ communication skills are tested on a Standard English that is assumed to be correct. Test questions often force decisions between the standard and other accepted informal usages. The problem is that there is no single English language—for example; several dialects of English are spoken in Missouri (North Midland, South Midland, Southern, St. Louis area, and African American Vernacular). These dialects vary mostly in pronunciation, but have some grammatical differences as well. They are also found in different regions across Missouri. Test scores may be different if the responses to questions from students across the state were based on their dialects. Along this reasoning, MAP Test scores from students across the state were grouped by dialect regions based on maps created by Labov et al. Scores (disaggregated by race) were downloaded from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website. Census data was added to the MAP data in order to account for socioeconomic status (SES), age, and populations not speaking English, groupings that had been previously found to affect test scores and/or dialect. Linear regression found that scores in each region decreased with SES, that mean scores had a slight, statistically significant variation by region when taken into account simultaneously with SES (p-values ranged from p=.014 to p=.033). With SES and race accounted for, it is proposed that this variation is due to dialect.

INVESTIGATIONS OF FAUNAL DIETS AT POKAGON VILLAGE SITE TO DETERMINE FARMING PRACTICES OF THE POKAGON BAND CIRCA AD 1830
Frieda Fein
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

This study compares isotope ratios of a variety of domesticated and wild animal bones to determine the animals’ diets and the extent to which they were domesticated by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Native Americans (circa A.D. 1830). During the Removal Period, A.D. 1795 until 1840, the American government forced most Midwestern Native Americans off their traditional lands and onto reservations in western United States. The Pokagon Band was one of the few groups to avoid removal, perhaps because of their willingness to adopt European-American farming lifestyles; raising crops and domestic animals. Though excavations of the Pokagon Village site revealed bones of traditionally domesticated animals (cows, pigs, turkeys, and chickens), there is a spectrum of domestication. The Pokagons’ animals may have been left to forage for themselves as though wild, and then hunted when needed.<br><br> This experiment compares the stable carbon isotope ratios of both wild and domesticated animal bones found at the Pokagon site to determine the amount of maize in the animals’ diets. More maize suggests domestication—humans feeding animals surplus crops. To determine isotopic ratios, samples of bone collagen from each animal bone were isolated using sequential HCl and NaOH treatments. Collagen was analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The results show that traditionally domesticated animals had diets high in corn, suggesting a high extent of domestication and that the Pokagon Band followed farming practices typical of European-American settlers. This study provides insight into strategies used by Potawatomi to resist removal from their traditional lands.

FACIAL EXPRESSION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO GESTURE IN WESTERN LOWLAND GORILLAS
Jennifer Lynn Draiss
Monroe-Woodbury High School, Central Valley, NY

Gorilla facial expression has been little studied, though gesture in the great apes has become an important topic in the study of primate cognition and the search for origins of language. Gesture and facial expression would seem closely tied as important elements of non-vocal communication, yet there has been no study of their relationship. One group of ten western lowland gorillas living at the Bronx Zoo was observed from June-August 2008. The goals of the study were to classify the facial expressions of the group, to examine the relationship between gestures and facial expressions, and to compare the facial expressions of two species of great apes: chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas. Facial expressions were performed a total of 370 times, gestures were performed 1,531 times, and both were performed simultaneously 229 times during the period of study. Thirty-nine unique gestures and 10 categories of facial expressions were observed. Gestures and facial expressions, when performed simultaneously, resulted in an immediate visible body movement from the receiver more frequently than either gesture alone or facial expression alone. Because this scenario has the greatest impact on the receiver, the relationship between voluntary and involuntary forms of communication in other species must be studied.

THE EFFECTS OF ACETYLCHOLINE ON MEMORY
Rebekah Lynn Inez Ivie
Trotwood Madison High School, Trotwood, OH

The experiment was conducted to test the effects of Acetylcholine on memory. The experiment should prove that the high amounts of Choline found in chicken liver will improve the memory of goldfish. The experiment was performed on six fancy fantail goldfish. The fish were placed in a thirty gallon aquarium and were separated into control and experimental groups. The control group was fed a constant diet of goldfish flakes, while the experimental group was fed a small amount of chicken liver, in addition to the goldfish flakes. The fish were tested everyday for two weeks in a simple water maze and timed to see if the diet would affect their times. At the end of the two weeks the times were compared to one another. The fish that received the chicken liver had shorter times indicating a better short term memory, supporting the original hypothesis. This research can be continued and possibly lead to a cure for Alzheimer's Disease.

DO YOU HAVE SYNESTHESIA? PHASE III APPLIED LEARNING THROUGH MINDMAPPING
Alexandra Christine Hummel
Florence High School #14-1, Florence, SD

The purpose of this project is to utilize the previously gathered information of Synesthesia and to apply this phenomenon into everyday learning, through the process of mindmapping. The hypothesis for this project is that through Synesthetic Mindmapping, results will illustrate the effectiveness of applied Synesthesia in learning, and subjects who are visual learners will be more likely to benefit.<br><br>The procedure consisted of two experimental and control groups. The subjects in the experimental group used the Synesthetic Mindmapping after going through a series of tests after studying with their Mindmaps. The control group was restricted to using traditional note taking techniques. During the testing period, the subjects were retested for more accurate results, while also looking for improvements.<br><br>The results showed that the subjects’ places in the two experimental groups exemplified improvement in all category areas such as: reading comprehension, problem solving, and memorization of the testing material. The control group however, remained somewhat similar, while varying little throughout each category. <br><br>In conclusion, the researcher’s hypothesis and application of Synesthetic Mindmapping in learning environments can be supported through this research. Although, the project would require further testing of all subjects to better analyze the effectiveness of this new way of learning. The results found in the project could demonstrate useful in future applications of learning methods in every classroom. Overall, the results found in the project strongly support the goal of the researcher and prove to be an exciting and possible new way of learning.

GENES OR GENIUS: A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENETICALLY ACQUIRED PHYSICAL TRAITS AND EQUINE INTELLIGENCE
Catherine Grace McVey
Graham High School, Graham, NC

In 1992, Lind Tellington-Jones published a book which described how to judge equine personalities by reading facial traits. This procedure, which was based on an ancient gypsy method, was proven through an extensive survey process which included over 1,500 horses from nine different countries. With the completion of the human genome project, there has recently been a major push to discover if genes are responsible for cognition. A number of such studies have been performed in hopes that the answer might lead to cures for genetic diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Autism.<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to prove a link between genes and intelligence by showing a correlation between genetically acquired facial traits and cognition. Each horse was first evaluated and scored for cognitive ability based on the Tellington-Jones Method. The horses were them mentally evaluated through tests based on the three types of learning: Trial and Error (time taken to open a container), Habituation (time to become accustomed to a sound), and Conditioning (repetitions required to learn a cue). The results were found by comparing the horses' experimental rank to their intelligence profile. The data proved to be widely varied, with three horses serving as significant outliers.<br><br> In conclusion, the data supported the hypothesis, which was: If a horse receives a higher facial score than another, them he will perform better on cognitive tests. After removing the three horses under the age of ten (arguably immature by some standards), there were distinct trends found among the remaining mature horses. The highest scoring horses performed the best, and the lowest scoring horses performed the worst, just as predicted.

“THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON HUMAN INTELLIGENCE”
Alyssa Erin Devine
Clinton Senior High School, Clinton, NY

My project “The Effect of Exercise on Human Intelligence” hypothesis was that aerobic exercise will increase human intelligence because exercise induces the creation of neurons, an increase in blood flow, and an increase in neurotransmitters which strengthen the prefrontal cortex, sections of the brain that controls memory and learning. The purpose of my experiment was to discover if aerobic exercise increased human intelligence by using memory tests. I randomly selected 40 participants, 20 would be in the sedentary group and 20 would be in the aerobic group. All participants had one minute to memorize 20 objects and record as many as they could recall. Then, the sedentary group sat for 10 minutes while the aerobic group ran for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minute period ended, the participants had one minute to memorize a new set of 20 objects and record as many as possible. After all tests were completed, I found my results were statistically significant by finding the significance of the difference between two means for correlated samples. The sedentary group did significantly worse on the second memory test, t (19) = -2.17, p<.05 while the aerobic group did significantly better on the second memory test, t (19) =5.58, p< .001. One possible explanation for the results is due to aerobic activity increasing brain volume in areas concerned with executive control and memory processes. In addition, exercise relieves stress and creates a calming effect that increases focus.

My objective was to determine if students’ processing styles (sequential versus spatial) influence their abilities to achieve high GPAs or to earn high PSAT scores.<br><br> Informed consent was obtained from 77 students who voluntarily participated in a validated survey to determine each subject’s neurological processing style. A school administrator collected the surveys, wrote each subject’s GPA and PSAT scores on an attached paper, and then removed the name of the student. These scores were used to determine any correlation between academic achievement and a subject’s processing style. <br><br> Primary results indicate that sequential processors score higher on PSATs and achieve higher cumulative GPAs, on average, than do all tested subjects. Spatial processors score lower on PSATs and achieve lower cumulative GPAs, on average, than do all tested subjects. This suggests that spatial processors are at a disadvantage in the current educational system as measured by criteria deemed important by schools and colleges (GPAs and PSAT scores). Furthermore, data indicate that highly sequential processors saturate their GPAs more so than predicted by a GPA/PSAT trend-line for all subjects, indicating that highly sequential processors are not challenged enough in the current educational system. <br><br> This year the National Academy set ‘individualized education’ as one of their top goals for the next decade. Because processing style does seem to influence academic success, the ability to individualize education based on each student’s processing style could be the key to enabling all students to excel at school.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF CLASSICAL AND ROCK MUSIC IN FACT RETENTION IN ADOLESCENTS 15 TO 17 YEARS OLD.
Selena Marie Rodriguez-Rivera
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The problem studied was: is there a difference between an environment of silence, listening to classical music or rock music in the retention of facts among adolescents 15-17 years of age. The hypothesis is that an environment of silence will permit a greater retention of facts than either listening to classical or rock music, given that it will allow complete concentration. A series of experiments were conducted with voluntary individuals who were asked to memorize a sequence of ten (10) colors in a time span of two (2) minutes. First in an environment of silence, then listening to classical music, followed by rock music. The classical music containing one song with lyrics and two without and within the rock music two songs with lyrics and one without. The experiment was repeated 3 times with the same individuals to take into consideration their mood and other factors. After tabulating the results it is observed that the hypothesis was accepted because in an environment of silence there was a greater retention of facts. It was also found that the use of lyrics affected the retention process in a negative way in both classical and rock music. If absolute silence is not possible (as it is the case in daily life) the use of an agent such as music, preferably classical music without lyrics would be useful to accompany the memorization/ studious process as a neutralizer to eliminate external noises.

THE FORMAL MUSICAL EDUCATION AND ITS RELATION WITH THE NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR OF THE ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN JALISCO, MEXICO.
Mariana Ramirez
Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, MEXICO

The main aim of this project was to prove if it exists a relation between the young people that have formal musical education and their behavior. From these results it was possible to design a strategy based in formal musical education as an alternative to foster the positive behavior in adolescents of Jalisco, Mexico.<br><br>Considering that formal musical education promotes the development of various abilities related with the emotional aspects, it could be possible to channel the impulses that provoke a negative behavior. <br><br>This research was composed by 2 phases. During Phase I, from April to October 2008, it was designed a measurement instrument questionnaire-type, based on 10 disorders of the adolescent behavior, applied to 208 young people; women and men, between 14 and 19 years old, with a medium socio-economic level, divided in 2 samples: Sample “A” was composed of subjects who had studied formal music education for at least 2 years, and sample “B” was composed of subjects who had not. <br><br>The reliability of the measurement instrument was 0.83 according to the Alpha’s Cronbach test. The Levene test and T-test were applied using the SPSS software to compare the means of each sample. Young people who had been exposed to formal musical education present less negative behavior that those who never had musical education. <br><br>During the Phase II, from December to April 2009, a strategy based in formal musical education was designed and structured to promote the positive behavior of adolescents in Jalisco through a longitudinal research.

A TEENAGE EPIDEMIC: A CORRELATION STUDY OF STRESS, SLEEP AND OBESITY IN ADOLESCENCE
Ashley Grace Larson
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

Obesity is the number one epidemic in adolescents. However, new studies reveal that obesity isn’t the only rising epidemic, sleep deprivation and stress also on the rise in today’s teens. The purpose of this study was to see if there is a correlation between sleep and obesity, stress and obesity, and sleep and stress. Three surveys were used to collect data; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a stress scale for youth, and a demographic survey. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Results showed that there is a significant correlation between stress level and hours of sleep. I also found that different people have different stress coping mechanisms. There was some association between sleep and BMI levels. When asked a likert question, “when I am stressed I…” a relationship between stress and eating versus stress and sleeping was found to be significant.

THE NUMBER CHART: THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE VISION SCREENING PROGRAM FOR PRE SCHOOL CHILDREN
Benedict Manuel Redublo Priela
Holy Infant Academy, Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, PHILIPPINES

Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision loss in children.(1,3)It can only be prevented and treated effectively before age 7,(5,12) otherwise the child could become handicapped all his life.(2,3)Visual acuity measurement is the only cost-effective screening test for Amblyopia.(16,32)This study therefore aims to develop an efficient vision screening program for preschool children for its early detection. This can be achieved with the development of a new vision screening device for the preschool age that is accurate, efficient and can be administered even by non-specialized personnel. The new chart utilized number optotypes that followed the standard Snellen progression. Visual acuity was measured monocularly in 90 children aged 4–6 years using both the Number and the Snellen charts from a distance of 20 feet. Results were compared for accuracy (Snellen vs. number), reproducibility (number chart read from right to left vs. left to right), efficiency and ease of use (time consumed to finish each test). There was high correlation of the measurements using the Snellen and Number Chart methods. Accuracy was 89.5% on the right eye and 88% on the left eye. Test time was 30-40% shorter when the Number Chart was used. Reproducibility of results was very high at 98.8%. Because visual acuity measurements using the Number Chart was fast, accurate, simple and easily administered even by non-specialized individuals, it can be used as an effective visual screening test for pre-school children especially those who could not yet recognize all the letters of the alphabet.

MUSICAL MICE.
Lori McClannahan
Alamogordo High School, Alamogordo, NM

I like to listen to heavy metal music. My thoughts on how mice perform after listening to different types of music is that those listening to what is considered heavy metal music would be more successful in maneuvering a maze than my other 2 groups. <br><br>To study this problem, I took 9 mice. I divided them into 3 groups of three mice each. My control group was subjected to the normal sounds in a day. The second group was subjected to what would be considered relaxing music. The 3rd group was played heavy metal music. Each group was placed in a different room.<br><br>At a various number of days, I placed them in a maze, one at a time. I used a stopwatch to time them getting through the maze. I used peanut butter to urge them through the maze. A veterinarian suggested that I use the peanut butter. <br><br>The results of my experiment supported my hypothesis: the mice listening to the heavy metal music had the fastest times through the maze. What surprised me was that the mice in the room with the quiet music became very aggressive. They also took the longest time to complete the maze.

THE EFFECT OF LEARNING MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN VARIOUS WAYS ON TRANSFER AND APPLICATION TO OTHER PROBLEMS.
Prachi Rajesh Agrawal
William L. Dickinson high school, Jersey City, NJ

Many students understand the concept of what they learn in class, but it becomes a difficult situation when they have to apply that knowledge to other problems. The purpose of this experiment was to test which way of learning mathematical principles is better to transfer and apply the knowledge to other problems. While many schools have incorporated traditional methods (concrete), the students haven’t shown a significant improvement in their ability at solving math problems in real life. Therefore learning the non–traditional way (combined / abstract) is expected to be the better learning strategy. <br><br>The experiment was conducted on 20 high school sophomores. They were given abstract, concrete, and abstract and concrete combined instruction lessons and asked to take a test of 20 questions that required them to use the recently acquired knowledge. The results were obtained from their test grades. The average score for the Abstract Way of learning was 65% while the average score for the Concrete Way of learning was 55%. But the average score for learning Abstract and Concrete combined was 80% which was the highest score. Abstract and Concrete learning combined produced the highest transfer of knowledge to the new learning situation than abstract and concrete learning alone. If abstract and concrete are considered alone, students were able to apply abstract learning better than concrete learning. High school math classes should incorporate more abstract examples in teaching math. Furthermore, a combination of both abstract and concrete would result in better learning.

SOCIOECONOMICS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION: AN EXAMINATION OF FACTORS AND POLICIES THAT NARROW THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP
Jonathan Dean Loucks
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

The institution of national education standards in 2001 through No Child Left Behind, has sparked great and ongoing controversy among many teachers and administrators. For opponents, the primary contention is that student achievement is unlikely, if at all possible, with students belonging to certain demographics. This investigation sought to challenge this idea, asserting that all students can become successful learners, regardless of their social classes. Research, like that conducted by Rothstein (2004), has revealed that many schools can overcome their low performance disposition if certain factors within the school, and even more importantly, within the community, are corrected or accommodated for. Studies have found that low-income, high performing schools often have exceptional community support programs, applicable professional development opportunities for staff, and outstanding, distinguishable leadership. This investigation has confirmed previous studies by finding that approximately 75% of the variation in the percentage of students meeting standards can be accounted for by quantitative values (i.e. demographics, salaries, budget distributions, etc.), leaving the other 25% to likely be accounted for by qualitative variables. These results can be used by administrators to evaluate applications to their current systems and programs potentially leading to an overall improvement in the public school system.

RECREATING THE ENGLISH ALPHABET AND STUDYING THE REPLICATION OF SYMBOLS
Paul Julius Martinez
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

My experiment was intended to see if I could recreate the English alphabet from the Phoenician alphabet. I wanted to find out why each letter was the shape that it was, i.e., why A=A, B=B, etc. To test this I had people copy the Phoenician alphabet. Each person would copy what the last person wrote, so any small mistakes would become permanent, simulating changes over long periods of time<br><br> My first trials were not very successful. Only a few symbols actually turned into English letters. Trying to understand what caused my experiment to not be a success, I planned a secondary experiment that would test two possible conditions which I believed could have hindered my original experiment. I wanted to test the influence of the complexity of the symbols, which I tested by using simple symbols such as circles or squares, and the influence of the level of familiarity between the subjects and the symbols, which I tested by using English letters.<br><br> After completing my second experiment, its results explained the unsuccessful results of my original experiment. Both the simple shapes and the English letters mostly stayed the same. The actual evolution of the alphabet took place with people who actually understood it, while my experiment used people who saw the symbols as completely foreign. In order to find a better answer to my original hypothesis, in a future experiment I would have to adjust the conditions to counteract the poor influences that I tested for in my second experiment.

BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR VAL66MET POLYMORPHISM DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTS REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW
Katherine Grace Nabel
National Cathedral School, Washington, DC

Hypothesis and Background. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant secreted protein in the central nervous system (CNS), influences neuronal growth, development, and neurogenesis. Substitution of Valine (Val) to Methionine (Met) in the BDNF gene at codon 66 is associated with increased anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders. We hypothesized that Met carriers, compared to the more common Val homozygotes, would show altered task-dependent neural activity in working memory and basal resting network using a non-invasive imaging technique. <br><br>Methods. 71 healthy age-matched Caucasians of known BDNF genotype were evaluated by PET scanning following IV bolus of H215O while engaged in memory or control tasks. Using special computer programs, I analyzed these images and defined statistically significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). <br><br>Results. Analysis of the working memory data showed increased rCBF for Met carriers in the right hippocampus (p < 0.001). During rest, they showed increased rCBF in bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal regions compared to Val homozygotes (p = 0.01). Thus, specific differences were observed in rCBF at rest and after 14 memory tasks depending on the BDNF variant.<br><br>Conclusions. BDNF genotype affects the distribution of blood flow to the brain, especially to the hippocampus and parahippocampus. The Met variant associated with neurological disorders showed heightened responses in association with a mental task and at rest. Our data suggests that BDNF may play a causal role in the development of psychiatric disorders, and the Met BDNF may also represent a target for therapeutic intervention.

DOES INDIVIUDALITY IN TEACHING STYLES POSTITIVELY AFFECT STUDENT CONCEPT MASTERY?
Cole Christopher Allick
Staint John Public High School, Saint John, ND

A. Are any two people in the world exactly the same? If that were the case, then wouldn't the world be a lot easier to work with? We could set standards that everyone would afree with because we would all be the same! Unfortunately, however, that is not how life works.<br><br>B. If no two people are the same, why do we use one standard teaching style for all students in a classroom? This practice has resulted in an education system that doesn't get as many students passing as there should be.<br><br>C. I took it upon myself to attempt to find a method of teaching that would be more beneficial to all students in a classroom. I produced a test that would determine an individual's learning style. After determning an individual's style, I incorporated their strongest style as I taught them a new concept. I quizzed them on the concept and compared the results to students who were taught by the standard method. <br><br>D. Seven out of nine students scored higher than the average score of an individual from the control group on their quiz. 100% of each learning style group's average score was higher than the control gorup's average on the quiz. <br><br>E. In conclusion, I determined that to be a successful teacher, one must ahve each tupe of style highlighted in their teaching practices. Also, a greater number of successful students can be graduated through our education program by individualizing our teaching methods.

GIVE US A SIGN

The project tested the ways in which an individual can live life proactively to prevent brain disorders of memory loss including Alzheimer’s and dementia. This experiment tested the hypothesis that if a person increases their daily brain stimulation and has the correct combination of specific lifestyle factors then his/her memory acuity would increase the best. This was prominently proven correct on many levels. This project tested the memory of forty-two senior citizens, living in the same senior-living community, which had not been diagnosed with any form of memory-loss. The participants were asked to attend a memory class once a week for eight weeks that taught the alphabet of Morse code and American Sign Language along with several other brain-stimulating activities including crossword puzzles, reading comprehension and music. At the end of each class, the participants took a Morse code test, an American Sign Language test, a visual test, and a number test to insure that all aspects of the brain's memory were being tested. The scores of the participants were then compared with different factors of the participants' lives as answered on a survey given at the beginning of the project. The resulting scores revealed that individuals that were female, read more, exercised more, slept 7-9 hours/night, had more than two parents, more siblings, more grandchildren, one spouse, played an instrument, worked in their lifetime, did not serve in the armed forces, and had the least severe medical history increased their memory acuity the best. All forty-two participants increased their memory level to some extent proving that mental stimulation as a vital and necessary factory in maintaining one's memory. The fact that the results exhibited that certain aspects of a person's life had a definite affect on memory proved that one can live proactively in preventing brain disorders involving memory that often plague mankind as the passing of time challenges us all.

VOTING SYSTEMS: AN OUTCOME ANALYSIS
Vikash Evans Hypio
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

Many aspects of voting systems have been examined. Plurality Method, the most commonly used voting system, has been shown to produce outcomes that are disputable and do not necessarily satisfy the voters’ choice. Plurality Method is primarily used because it is both easily understood by the public and easy to tabulate. There are other systems whose outcomes may offer more satisfaction to voters. Four systems were chosen for experimentation: Plurality Method (the status quo), Borda Count, Instant Runoff, and Sequential Pairs.<br><br> A simulated election was held using four soft drink preferences as candidates. Each voter’s choices were recorded on a single ballot and choices were run through each of the selected voting systems. Results were tabulated and the voting subjects were provided with the results. Voters were then given a survey to rank their satisfaction with the outcomes for each system. An average of satisfaction ratings was calculated, with Instant Runoff receiving the highest satisfaction. Results for the three alternative systems were also compared with Plurality Method using a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.

SECRET FACTORS AFFECTING THE DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IN EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTAL HOSPITALS
Gina Mamdouh Gayed
Dar El Tarbiah American School, Cairo, EGYPT

A cornerstone of good medical care is the relationship between the patient and his or her physician since the stress from a difficult encounter between the two parties can negatively affect the patient's health and possibly also the physician's, while efficient communication and interaction between the patient and the doctor can actually be therapeutic. However, there are patient-physician dyads in which the relationship might turn into a source of frustration for both the patient and the physician. Frequently, expectations held by both parties affect reaction to and satisfaction with the encounter. <br><br>So far, there have only been few empirical investigations of the doctor-patient relationship in Egyptian governmental hospitals, limiting the process of continuous professional development. The purpose of this project was to examine this yet unexplored relationship in order to help improve healthcare in Egypt. <br><br>A survey consisting of 24 five-level Likert items and 3 demographic questions was created to test the patients' views on their relationship to their doctors, and patients in different governmental hospitals in Cairo were asked to complete it. <br><br>Another survey composed of 12 five-level Likert items and 2 demographic questions was created to test the doctors' views on different patient behaviors that might cause doctors' frustration, and was given to doctors in the same hospitals. <br><br>Analysis of the results yielded implications for potential improvements in the doctor-patient relationship and provided a deeper insight into the underlying causes of subjects' responses.

AlDuffi High School, Jubail Industrial, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

Individuals with total paralysis disabilities are deprived from their ability to control their movement, transportation and performing simple daily tasks. Such individuals usually live with a permanent care taker. This could develop a low-self-esteem and low confidence levels in such individuals. <br><br>Total paralysis individuals are incapable of controlling most of their body muscles with the exception of some muscles such as tongues. This was a door opener for RoboCare.<br><br>The RoboCare research project studies the possibility of enabling individuals with total paralysis disability to move freely without need for continuous assistance using electronics & robotics technology and tongue muscles.<br><br>The device consists of a microcontroller (LEGO NXT Brick was used in the model), 4 switches (to serve as touch sensors) mounted on a flexible wire and an extension cord. Each switch is wired to the microcontroller which is programmed to control the movement of the wheel chair with a robotics arm that is mounted on top of the wheel chair joystick. The microcontroller is also programmed to switch on and off home appliances such as music stereos, lights, TV and heaters by double clicking on switches.<br><br>RoboCare provides people having total paralysis with a better way to live and interact with their world. Such individuals would be able to control their movement and their home appliances without a need for permanent care takers.<br><br>After several test of the RoboCare unit conducted by people having total paralysis under proper supervision of medical experts, RoboCare was found to be helpful in helping those individuals use the wheelchair independently, have a positive psychological impact and more social interaction.

This experiment will utilize various Stroop Tests to determine the effects of age and gender on the amount of interference experienced. I believe that the older the participant is, the easier it will be for them to ignore possible interference, and that female participants will hesitate less when faced with the Stroop Tests.<br><br>I will ask male and female participants, ages ranging from 5 years to 90 years, to state out loud numbers, shapes, or colors accordingly as fast as they can. I will time them, and every time they hesitate or say the wrong thing I will tally a miss. <br><br>There may be some difficulty with getting the times exactly right, and how I would group data together. <br><br>I believe the Stroop Tests, if expanded and enhanced a bit, can be used to detect possible illnesses or disorders such as Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, Anorexia, and Bulimia.

The main purpose of doing this project help the deaf people who cant hear and speak to communicate with their society without using deaf sign language.<br><br>System one helps the other people to speak to the deaf without using the sign language, so everyone can speak to the deaf easily. That is executed by translating the speech to pulses. Every letter has its own pulse and its own deaf sign language. This device contains a speech recognition circuit which takes the word by a microphone and recognizes it then it will send it by wires to the microcontroller board which receives that signal digital letters. The microcontroller board checks that word by using a digital dictionary system and separates the word to letters then the vibration sensors control every letter to give its own pulse on each finger.<br><br> <br><br>This device contains those sign language buttons on the gloves so the deaf types the letters of the word in the buttons. Then those button pulses are connected with the Microcontroller board which checks those digital letters and translates them, then sends them to speech chips which speak what he has typed by using the speakers. This feature helps to make a device communication between the deaf and the person who is using the microphone to communicate with him. Then the device translates speech into pulses. Then the deaf or dumb replies by pressing on letter's buttons then the person hears the answer.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: WHAT TRIGGERS OUR PERCEPTIONS?
Isaiah Martin Butler, Katherine Eva Joyce, 
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, MN

Everyday, people make perceptions about the people they meet. Social perceiving is the process of interpreting sensory information that has you draw conclusions about the individuals around you. This experiment was conducted in efforts to find what affects our perceptions, which, unfortunately, are usually based upon stereotypes, as well as neurological connections made within the brain, and also to make people aware of the their stereotypical nature. In order to discover any other affects on perceptions and what perceptions would be made about specific images, this project had participants draw conclusion in written form in addition to answering multiple choice questions about twenty pre-chosen pictures. They filled out a short questionnaire concerning their own personal characteristics, including gender, age, birth order, home location, and ethnicity. These were used, along with student research concerning stereotypes and brain functions about perceptions, to analyze the results and to recognize patterns and possible causes. <br><br> To interpret the results, we took each answer, recorded it, and then simplified it to a negative, positive, or neutral response. Then we compared that to the stereotypical first impression that we hypothesized that individuals would make about the picture, which we had previously designated negative, positive, or neutral. The results concluded that 63.7% of the time, subjects in this experiment had response that was stereotypical, and when asked to explain their answer the often used answers that relied on prejudices. These results concur with our hypothesis that a majority of will have a stereotypical conclusion about the pictures we exposed them to, because of the subjects’ exposure to society view and preexisting memories that cause them to associate and classify people into certain groups. This shows that perceptions are a combination of society’s installment of norms and memories from the hippocampus applied to social environments.

MIND GAMES: INNOVATION
Nolan Brent Timmons, Felix Plancarte, 
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

The Outcome of last year’s project, Mind Games, inspired a new idea in the further use of video games to increase mental performance. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to be able to determine if the violence and pace of a video game such as Gears of War 2 can help the test participants better retain both episodic and semantic memory. Episodic and Semantic are two types of declarative long-term memory located in the hippocampus of the brain. Semantic memory pertains to the facts and general knowledge, and episodic memory is related to personal experiences and events.<br><br> Eight female participants all over the age of thirty and under sixty-five were chosen to participate. The test used was the Paired Associate Learning Test from the Camden Memory Tests. The test was altered to better test long-term memory. All participants were asked to play for a minimum of thirty minutes a day, three times a week. Two participants acted as controls, and did not come into contact with the video games. The rest were split up into two groups: violence and nonviolence.<br><br> Though there was no statistical significance, visual test scores from the final test did approach significance as well as visual response time, which had a confidence level near 90%. Therefore, these results may warrant further investigation of this experimental procedure due to the majority of test subjects being visual learners, showing signs of significance on the second set of tests as compared to the baseline tests.

DEGREE OF LATERALIZATION AS A PREDICTOR OF PERFORMANCE
Joanne Chou, Andrea Clark, 
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

It was once believed that one hemisphere dominated in all specific areas of intellect. However, the human brain is separated by a longitudinal fissure, which creates two distinct cerebral hemispheres by the corpus callosum, each hemisphere specializing in their own function. The purpose of this study was to determine if a person’s specific lateralization affects how well they work in a team. It was hypothesized that highly lateralized teams would perform better than low lateralized teams. <br><br>College participants were tested through a lateralization screener, which asked to maximize the number of times they can tap a spacebar, a spatial task, and recite the phrase, “Cat, Dog, Horse”, a verbal task. Participants were then categorized according to their scores from the lateralization screener by their lateralization and grouped with same categorized participants for phase two. Phase two involved playing Schizoid, a highly cooperative game, which monitored their performance in their lateralized teams.<br><br>As a result, there was a slight increase in performance for the highly lateralized teams; however, it is not a great enough increase to indicate a statistically significant difference in team performance. Understanding the specific nature of how spatial abilities are lateralized in the brain is important for several reasons. Clinicians use this information to predict the outcomes of brain injury or surgery. Predicting the consequences of specific brain injuries in order to create interventions for these patients is vital to understand how they react to brain surgery.

PERSPECTIVE OF LIFE: PUERTO RICAN TEENAGERS QUALITY OF LIFE BASED ON HOME ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL LIFE, RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES
Frances Del Mar Bravo, Ghiara Lugo, 
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation is to describe and relate the quality of life and the perspective of life in observable conducts which can be related with their social life, home environment, physical activities and religious experience by gender. 150 subjects within the metropolitan area between the ages of 13-16 were submitted to the SRP-I profile (questionnaire designed by the principal investigator and revised by a psychiatrist.) The data was analyzed using Chi-Square p ≤ 0.05. There was a significant association between the quality of life and the perspective of life in Puerto Rican teenagers. The family’s profile was related to the social quality of life. Teenagers whose parents were not married tended to have greater encounters with their friends due to the fact that they are trying to fill an emotional vacancy. Religious and moral values are learned from mothers who acquire their core values within church. Teenagers tend to have a healthier life style due to the core values imposed by their mothers. The poor quality of life in females is because of the pressure imposed, especially when related to academic profile and a lack of physical activities. Males’ poor quality of life is associated to the pressure imposed by parents because they want their children not only to enroll in physical activities, but to also have a healthy academic profile. A positive perspective of life in teenagers is associated to a healthy quality of life in the home environment (family profile and parent pressure) and religious experience.

ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID: TOWARDS A NOVEL NEUROPROTECTIVE TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN A DROSOPHILA MODEL
Peter Hans Massey, Shaunak K. Bakshi, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative conditions, affecting over 5 million people in the U.S. alone. Recent studies have suggested a possible link between oxidative stress and the development of Alzheimer’s. alpha-Lipoic Acid has been characterized as an effective antioxidant in Drosophila melanogaster. The purpose of this study was to investigate alpha-Lipoic Acid as a possible treatment for Alzheimer’s by examining its effects on the development of Beta-amyloid plaques and learning behavior in UAS-APP (Alzheimer’s model) Drosophila. Flies were divided into six test groups and four controls - APP, stressed APP, normal Canton-S, and stressed Canton-S. Three normal APP and three stressed APP groups were each supplemented with 0.43, 1.08, and 2.15 mM of alpha-Lipoic Acid. Stress was induced through heat shock. Dissection and isolation of the brain proper were followed by Thioflavin-S staining and slide preparation. Plaque growth was quantified using fluorescence microscopy and analyzed via ImageJ software. Learning behavior was analyzed through olfactory associative conditioning protocol established by Tully followed by a performance index. The results demonstrate that alpha-Lipoic Acid has significant potential as a neuroprotective treatment for Alzheimer’s. While learning index of 10 day old flies was not significantly improved by alpha-Lipoic Acid treatment, the level of plaque build-up was significantly reduced in the later stages of life.

BULIMIA: THE EFFECTS OF GASTRIC ACID ON THE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES OF TOOTH ENAMEL
Jessica Lynn Jackson, Thao Ngo, Qianying Lin
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Over the past several decades, an increasing number of teenage girls have suffered from eating disorders such as bulimia. They make themselves vomit without realizing the harmful effects it can have on their teeth. This experiment tested the relationship between the frequency of exposure to gastric acid and the loss of tooth enamel. The hypothesis was that the repetitive exposure of gastric acid to enamel would lead to both a measurable and an observational loss of enamel.<br><br>In the experiment, teeth were attached to wires that were hung from clamps on ring stands. The teeth were then suspended over solutions of water ahd HCl correspondingly for exposures. There were two different sets of experiments: a five-minute exposure and a ten-minute exposure. An analytical scale was used to measure the difference between the initial and final weights of the teeth after each exposure. <br><br>The data and the analysis indicated that five out of six of the vaiable teeth lost greater mass than the controls. Also, the variables began to exhibit a coarse-like, chalky texture while the controls did not have any observational changes.<br><br>The experiment's results suggested that bulimia can cause severe damage to the tooth enamel. It causes the enamel to become coarse and fragile. However, this damage does not occur fast enough for the stomach acid to damage the teeth of a person who only vomits periodically due to illness. Still, a more frequent exposure to gastric acid will lead to tooth enamel damage.

ACTION AND AWARENESS: AN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION METHODOLOGY
Ana Claudia Cassanti, Ana Clara Cassanti, Felipe Seabra Fernandes
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

Public awareness about global warming is crucial to society. Actions are necessary to try to control climate change. Considering that amounts of knowledge is taught at school, we created a proposal of an environmental education methodology. <br><br>Our objective was to make students aware of the problems related to global warming by holding meetings to discuss theoretical approaches and creative practices. <br><br>Our hypothesis was that environmental education agents must be young students that act in the leadership, motivation and organization of activities conducted in social, economical and environmental lines.<br><br>The methodology embraces four modules: “deforesting”, “economy & development”, “agribusiness” and “energy”. The reason for this set is that they are connected with the major source of greenhouse gases’ emission in Brazil.<br><br>Each module contained a series of actions, with activities ranging from critical analyses (undergone by young “multipliers”) to the outline of creative measures. For this study, individuals (students) who took part in the activities were asked to fill in a questionnaire. By a qualitative approach, the research aimed at reaching an understanding of ecological-friendly behaviors shown after their involvement in the activities. <br><br>The findings showed the efficiency of our methodology as the majority of the individuals stressed the relevance of the methods used to become aware of environmental matters. <br><br>This research is liable to contribute with schools keen on promoting changes in students’ behavior regarding their ecological awareness, since it allows a well-structured approach towards a comprehensive environmental education.

MATERIALS USED IN DENTAL RESTORATION AND ITS EFFECTS IN HEALTH
Carlos Gabriel Alvarado-Melendez, Denisse Hernandez, 
Jose Gautier Benitez High School, Caguas, PUERTO RICO

Dental amalgam is a material that has been used for more than 150 years, but since its beginning, it has caused controversy because one of its principal components is the element mercury, that can result in serious risks to health. For this reason an investigation was carried out to determine how much knowledge the common citizen has about these components and if these affect their health. The hypothesis was that the common citizen doesn’t have any knowledge of the components of the material used in dental restoration and it is affecting their health.<br><br> To do this research, a questionnaire was designed and two hundred and sixty (260) human subjects answered it. People above 18 years old and from different social backgrounds were chosen at random.<br><br> After the information was analyzed it was possible to demonstrate that the hypothesis presented is correct; common citizens have no knowledge about the components used in dental restoration and its effects in health. Sixty seven percent (67%) answered that they haven’t received any kind of information related to dental amalgam, 63% answered that their dentists used dental amalgam and 43% indicated that many of the illnesses they suffer appeared after they received dental restoration with amalgam.<br><br> This research is addressed to pertinent institutions, so that they develop conscience and inform the citizens about the materials used in dental restoration and the possible effects in their health.

THE EFFECTS OF MULTI-TASKING ON SHORT-TERM MEMORY
Hayley Rose McCrae, Rosarin Bhutarak, 
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

This project tested the effects of multi-tasking on short-term memory. Specifically, the effect text messaging has on a teenager’s ability to memorize and recall words. Short-term memory is limited in its duration and capacity. If teenage participants’ short-term memory of a list of words is tested with interference, then they will recall fewer words than when tested without interference, because the conflicting interference caused the failure of the brain’s short-term memory to encode the new information. Participants were given two similar word lists to memorize and then recall, both with the same amount of words and same level of difficulty, as well as the same amount of time to memorize and recall them in. During the memorization of one of the word lists, participants received and had to respond to a text message every minute (the interference). Overall, almost all of the participant’s recall of the words after the test with interference was less than their test without any interference. Two participants recalled more words with the test that included interference than the test without. 61% of the participants recalled over 50% more words with the no interference test. Due to the results, it is concluded that interferences and multi-tasking worsen the brain’s ability to store and retain information in the short-term memory.

MAPPING VERBAL MEMORY FUNCTION FROM DIRECT BRAIN AND SCALP RECORDINGS FROM EPILEPSY SURGERY PATIENTS
Weili Zheng, Shravanthy Gumidyala, Jonathon Schwarzbauer
Illinois Math and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by chronic and unprompted seizures that originate in various areas of the brain, and affects approximately 2.5 million in the United States. Seizures that occur can potentially affect a patient’s auditory response. Our study’s purpose was to determine if latencies in scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) correspond, as well as if epilepsy affects the latency of the verbal memory potentials relating to the recollection of language in epilepsy patients. To observe these effects, subjects wore EEG scalp caps and underwent a verbal memory paradigm. Patients with epilepsy also had EEG recordings through intracranial grids. All patient interaction and data collection was performed by the study's principal investigator. The recorded EEG files were filtered through an analysis program and were used to create average power spectrums, using gamma frequency analysis. The latencies of the verbal memory potentials in the scalp data was then compared with the corresponding EEG of patients with epilepsy. Latencies in patients with epilepsy were compared with those that were non-afflicted. Patients with epilepsy did not exhibit a significantly higher latency than patients without epilepsy in the verbal memory potentials. However, results are inconclusive, and more testing is needed, as data from patients with epilepsy were scarce. Understanding exactly how much epilepsy affects auditory responses has many uses, including improving surgical proceedings in determining resection areas for patients with epilepsy. In addition, if scalp and intracranial EEG data correspond, methods could possibly be developed to eliminate the invasive intracranial grid insertion to observe patients with epilepsy.

St. James High School, St. James, LA

This experiment studies African American and Caucasian people while answering the following questions: Is there a relationship between personality type, race, and the use of body language? Is there a defined difference in the use of body language between each group? Which race performs more body language? Which personality type performs more body language? Which personality type occurs more often in each race? 200 human subjects will be chosen, 100 of which will be African American, of which 50 will be male and 50 will be female. The remaining 100 subjects will be Caucasian, 50 of which will be male and 50 will be female. These subjects will be complete strangers to the interviewers. These 200 people will be given an online survey. This survey is based on the internal external locus of control. People who receive higher scores will be considered more extroverted, while people who receive scores that are closer to 0 will be considered more introverted. Using these results, the subjects will be narrowed down to the most introverted and extroverted of the 200 subjects. 120 people will be chosen, 60 African American and 60 Caucasian (Both broken down into even number of gender and personality types as before.). Next, each subject will participate in a structured interview, which will ask seven questions that demand thorough explanation. The subject will be led to believe that his or her responses are being recorded; however, the interviewer will actually record the amount of hand and body gestures each subject performs. The questions will be asked by using a recording. To ensure that each person has the same amount of time, each interview will be limited to 10 minutes. A list of common hand and body gestures will be created and used to minimize recording time. A quiet, neutrally decorated area will be used to conduct all interviews to keep distractions to a minimum and to present a steady environment, which will minimize inaccurate times and data. All data recorded is then collected and compared.

A CLOSER LOOK AT SOCIAL TABOO: FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
Ahmed Safieldin Aboumandoor, Ahmed Shoieb, 
Futures International School, Cairo, EGYPT

Lots of issues are still out of touch taboos in our Eastern culture. We chose to discuss female genital mutilation (FMG), reported to be 97% prevalent in our country according to UNICEF reports. <br><br>FMG comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non- medical purposes. This practice dating since Pharaonic time has lots of side effects ranging from bleeding and frigidity to death as evidenced in many cases.<br><br>In this project, we are trying to investigate the factors that helped this tradition to prevail in spite of the advanced educational profile of the people in Egypt nowadays.<br><br>A survey was conducted covering all aspects of FGM. The population was divided into 3 groups: Urban, Rural and Bedouins. Participants were chosen from different genders, religious backgrounds, socio-economic levels, and educational backgrounds. Moreover, religious leaders, university professors and physicians were interviewed. According to the results, more than 50% of the participants in urban areas refuse FGM. Demographics were proved to play a great role in people's opinion whereas gender has no influence at all. It was also proved that this practice is deeply rooted and inherited in rural areas, which proves the psychological immaturity and resistance to change.

Dhahran Ahlyya School, Dhahran, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

Although the maximum weight carried by young students should not exceed 15% of their body weight, most students in lower elementary carry heavy school bags which could result in physical problems on them. <br><br>In an effort to overcome this, a survey was conducted to assess the level of parents' knowledge regarding the backpacks weight limit for thier children. <br><br>A sample of 53 randomly selected young students were selected to conduct the investigation.Each student's weight was measured in addition to the weight of the backpack they carried. It was found that 62.3% of the students carry bags that are overweight. Continuing at this rate, a large number of individuals would suffer from physical problems.<br><br>To prevent this, a "Friendly Bag" solution was introduced, provided with an electronic screen showing the reading from a light weight scale placed at the bottom of the bag. The "Friendly Bag" is a promising and practical solution which can prevent the development of physical problems for students. <br><br>The bag will be further modified to be fitted with an audible alarm which would sound when the weight of the bag exceeds a pre-set limit by parents. Also the application of the bag will be expanded to cover suitcases to warn travelers about potential excess weight.

Pain in the back and neck, sensation of persecution, labor absenteeism, and desire to commit suicide, these are some of the symptoms of a syndrome not very well-known in Argentina. It is called Burnout Syndrome and it is defined as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of successful achievement in one’s work with people.<br><br>This project focuses on teachers because of the negative impact it can have on the teachers themselves and especially on the pupils. As the above mentioned symptoms have been noticed daily in the schools of Concordia and teachers’ dissatisfaction is easily perceived, we realized this study was needed to establish the causes for them. <br><br>The main objective is to describe the grade of Burnout Syndrome present in the <br><br>Teachers of N° 51 “Felipe Gardel” High School and Comercio N° 2 “General Martín Miguel de Güemes” High School situated in Concordia city, province of Entre Ríos, Argentine Republic, where the result was LOW in both places.<br><br>Teacher Burnout was assessed using a work and socio-demographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory as well as “ C.O.P.E.” Carver’s Scale. Besides, conferences on the syndrome and its prevention through the development of a resilient personality were given at several schools of the city, delivering a brochure of our own.<br><br>This situation has different triggers, and serious consequences, and it is necessary to raise teachers’ awareness as it affects the base of our society: education.

RESPONSIBLY FULL SEXUALITY
Ana Laura Rodriguez, Barbara Rocio Caballero, 
Bernardino Rivadavia Technical School, La Banda, Santiago de Estero, ARGENTINA

The starting point of this research project was the raising of the following issue: “Which environment of daily interaction has been more influential in constructing knowledge and shaping behavior in 14- to 18-year-old-adolescents in the city of La Banda, Santiago del Estero, Argentina, and, was gender determination a binding factor regarding the development of a responsible sexuality?”<br><br>The following hypotheses have been considered:<br><br>- The family has lost their fundamental role as knowledge providers and consequently the school is nowadays taking on that responsability but not comprehensively.<br><br>- Family and school limited participation in building knowledge and developing behaviors regarding adolesecent´s sexuality boosts the increasingly relevant influential role of peer groups and the media, according to differences in gender.<br><br>The proposed design is descriptive and expository, while the research approach is quali-quantitative.<br><br>The sample was made up of 200 people who were randomly surveyed.<br><br>Once the research was completed, the hypothesis was validated, concluding that both family and school are growing weaker and weaker as supportive, formative and comprehensive frameworks. In such a context, peer groups as well as the media are becoming relevant as knowledge facilitators and behavior advisors for teenagers.

MUSIC THERAPY
Houa Xiong
John A. Johnson Senior High School, Saint Paul, MN

The objective of this experiment was to find out how people’s mood can be affected by music. My prediction was that music will have an effect on a person’s mood. The subjects went into a quiet room. They were asked what their mood was. A mood chart was shown to choose their mood from. Then the assigned songs were played according to that participant’s mood choice. After the songs were finished, they answered the rest of the survey questions. The control group sat in the room for three minutes without music or sounds. After the testing, these results demonstrated that there were mood changes in some people, but others were not affected. This indicated that music might be of some use for therapy. To refine my hypothesis, I will repeat the experiment using specific music on two racial types and reduce the number of mood choices.

THE EFFECTS OF BORDERLINE HYPOTHYROIDISM ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND DAYTIME DROWSINESS
Michael Andrew Fairchild Harding
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The experiment was designed to determine the effects of borderline hypothyroidism on quality of life and daytime sleepiness. This was achieved by first measuring the blood serum levels of Thyrotropin, the marker protein of thyroid activity. The patients were given the Epworth sleepiness scale and the HR Quality of Life Scale during routine visits with their health care providers. The results of the experiment did support the hypothesis; that if the blood serum concentration of biological marker of thyroid activity, Thyrotropin, is between half and a full standard deviation above the norm of the population of the population for an experimental group, then their quality of life shall be lower than and there daytime sleepiness shall be higher than that of the two control group of patients who either have been treated for thyroid deficiency or who have normal levels of Thyrotropin. The results of the experiment showed that the control group having the experimental mean of 2.91+/-3.83 HRQoL score points, 4.49+/-2.68 Epworth sleepiness score points, and 3.79+/-2.41 Harding Overall QoL score points. Contrastingly, the experimental group had the experimental mean of 7.20+/-6.53 HRQoL score points, 8.01+/-5.04 Epworth sleepiness score points, and 7.82+/-4.93 Harding Overall QoL score points. The null hypothesis of N0 treatment effect is supported because the P-Value of N1 is P≥7.84*10-5 for the Epworth sleepiness, P≥4.28*10-4 for the HRQoL score, and P≥1.01*10-6 for the combined Harding overall QoL score.

IMPROVING ADHD TREATMENT: A COMPARISON OF STIMULANT MEDICATION TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN WITH ADHD, COMPUTERIZED COGNITIVE TRAINING OF ATTENTION AND WORKING MEMORY, AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO
Kevin Michael Knight
Collegiate High School at Northwest Florida State College, Niceville, FL

This experiment was designed to test a new type of treatment for children with ADHD: Computerized cognitive training programs. Then, it was compared with a very common and widely used treatment method, stimulant medication. The purpose was, therefore, to determine if these programs were beneficial alone, and/or in addition to the medication. I hypothesized that the combination of medication and cognitive programs would produce the most improvement, whereas the games by themselves would produce the least improvement. I also hypothesized that, at pre-treatment, the the group on medication would have more severe ADHD symptoms on the Vanderbilt ADD Diagnostic Parent/Teacher Rating Scale (VADPRS/VADTRS).<br><br> My results indicate that, on the VADPRS, those in the medication group had more severe symptoms than those in the non-medication group. The medication group also had lower school performance scores, and lower relationship scores than then non-medication group. In the VADTRS, those in the medication group had lower symptom scores than those in the non-medication group. Those in the medication group still had lower school performance and relationship scores, however. In the online diagnostic assessments, which were used to track cognitive function improvement, those in non-medication group improved slightly more in attention and speed and flexibility and speed. Those in the medication group, however, showed more improvement across all the other tests, including working memory and processing speed. t-Tests were also conducted.<br><br> In conclusion, the data generally supports my hypothesis.

ABILITY TO SUPPRESS THE EXPRESSION OF DISTRESS IN HUMAN APOE MICE
Matthew Samuel Agam
Beaverton High School, Beaverton, OR

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops as a result of a traumatic experience, characterized by physical and emotional reactions brought on by related distressing memories. Common factors include car accidents and military deployment, which more recently have contributed to a spike in cases - 7.7 million Americans are currently affected. Other studies in humans have shown that there may be links between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and susceptibility to develop PTSD and other neuropsychiatric conditions (Freeman et al, 2005). The present study examined the effects of different ApoE genotypes on extinction, a mouse model of human PTSD. To test this effect, 46 male/female mice with genotypes ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 were exposed to a discomfort in a distinct context to generate a startle response, which was extinguished in that context in subsequent trials by reintroducing the animals into the same context without the discomfort. Measured through startled behavior (defined as the lack of all movement except respiration), video-tracking software showed that mice with genotypes ApoE3 and ApoE4 exhibited enhanced memory extinction compared to their ApoE2 counterparts. These results support a new concept of the relationship between ApoE genotype and learning and memory, since in previous research ApoE2 mice have been shown to have enhanced learning over those with ApoE3 and ApoE4 genotypes. My findings indicate that an ApoE2 genotype may be a risk factor for developing PTSD in humans.

THE IMPACT OF A SET OF TRAINING PROGRAMS ON THE SEROTONIN HORMONE IN A SAMPLE OF (8-9) YEAR-OLD STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND ITS CORRELATION TO THEIR ACHIEVEMENT AND BEHAVIOR (AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY)
Mohammad Mesbah Al-Refai
Modern Systems Schools, Amman, JORDAN

This study aims at discovering the impact of sports, dietary, and behavior training programs to improve the Serotonin hormone consumption, which is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain. The researcher has designed a set of sports, dietary, and behavior training programs, studied and moderated by a group of specialists to know their suitability to the subject of the study. The program lasted 8 successive weeks. It was conducted on the sample of (30) (8-9) year-old students with learning disabilities from different private schools. The sample was randomly divided into 2 equal groups: experimental and control groups. Each group was subject to a pre and a post measurement in Arabic Language and Mathematics in addition to the assessment of behavior and the level of the concentration of Serotonin hormone in the urine. <br><br>The results were statistically analyzed using the T test for both groups: independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test. The results have shown evident improvement in the experimental group's achievement level in Arabic language, with a percentage of (81.70%) and mathematics with (97.89%) due to implementing the training programs. It has also led to the increase of serotonin level with (29.54%) whereas the undesirable behavior has decreased with a percentage of (53.85%). However, no significant differences have been found between the pre and post measurement for the control group. <br><br>To sum up, the suggested training programs have not only improved the level of learning- disabled students' achievement and behavior, but also increased the level of Serotonin.

HARP THERAPY'S EFFECT ON THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA
Katherine Jane Steffl
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, MN

Music is an artistic form of communication incorporating instrumental and/or vocal tones in a structural manner. This experiment was designed to determine if Harp Therapy had a positive affect on the Medulla Oblongata of nursing home residents. The activity director of a Community Nursing Home was contacted. After receiving a list of eligible residents, subjects were met with once every week. Their emotional state, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after harp music was played for ten minutes. These steps were repeated for six weeks with every resident. <br><br> The data collected showed that there was a significant chance in the emotional state of the residents in a positive manner. The heart rate and blood pressure results were less noticeable although there was a positive difference for those variables. Nursing home residents do appreciate music in a powerful way. Music, especially the harp, raises their spirits and brings residents back to memorable times in their life. <br><br> This experiment was designed to determine if Harp Therapy had a positive affect on the Medulla Oblongata of nursing home residents. Due to the fact that nursing home residents respond well to music, harp therapy was a great tool in achieving positive changes in emotional state, heart rate, and blood pressure of the residents. <br><br> These results are applicable to nursing home residents because of their need for Music Therapy. Music with a different beat can gain the attention of nursing home residents when it is needed to calm their emotional state, heart rate, and blood pressure through therapeutic measures.

WHO AM I? THE ROLE SITUATIONAL FACTORS PLAY WHEN UNDERSTANDING THE SELF-CONCEPT
Jean Louise Leighton
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

How accurate are personality tests? Objectively, this experiment attempted to manipulate the outcomes of a personality test through prompting self-perceptions. These self-perceptions create frameworks through which one sees oneself in society. It was hypothesized that participants who reviewed Type Descriptions and predicted their resulting type before taking the test, would be influenced by the chosen identity. <br><br> The experimental group received the personality Type Descriptions and predicted which type reflected their individuality. Next, they completed the personality test. The control received the sections in reverse order, the test followed by the Type Descriptions. The four types include: Artisan, Guardian, Idealist, and Rational. Data analysis measured how close a group’s (experimental or control) results were to their chosen types.<br><br> The data showed significance (p=0.0831) at a significance level of 0.1, an acceptable level in Behavioral Sciences, between the experimental and control group’s discrepancies. The procedures were repeated with a second, more in-depth test. It was hypothesized that the same results would occur, but the second test had no significant difference (p=0.2362). <br><br> One can conclude that situational factors can affect how one analyzes their personality in a basic test, but not in a more in-depth test. Basic tests are poor indicators of our self-concept. This study is important to society because personality tests are similar to learning style tests used in the educational field. In the future, one could explore the perceived self as compared to the desired self.<br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF COMPREHENSION DIFFERENCES IN STRUGGLING READERS USING PHRASE AND CHARACTER SPACED MODELS, YEAR THREE
Lindsey Brooke Saunders
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

The purpose of this study was to investigate two text models designed for struggling readers and to determine their effects on comprehension levels. It was hypothesized that struggling readers would score higher on phrase-spaced passages as compared to character-spaced passages. To test this hypothesis, a test group of 180 students, 30 from each of grades 2,3,4,5,8 and 10 was used. Subjects who qualified for this study were those scoring in the lower 25% of their grade level on the FCAT or SAT10 test. Reading passages for each grade level were chosen from the Gates-MacGinitie reading test booklet. Passages were retyped using phrase and character-spaced formatting. The control passage for each level was unchanged. Each subject silently read a passage and answered six questions. The test was untimed. The questions were repeated without the original passage one week later for a test of memory. The tests were scored by identifying the number of correct explicit and implicit responses. Test scores were compared using paired t-tests and Pearson's Correlation Analysis. Both formatted conditions had a significant effect, p<0.05, when compared to the control condition, but phrase-spaced text was superior to character-spaced. Memory tests showed significant differences in test scores (p<0.05) using formatted passages but phrase-spaced text showed no significance over character spaced. These results support the researcher's hypothesis.

THE EFFECT OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME STUDENTS TEXT ON PHONES TO THE NUMBER OF MECHANICAL ERRORS IN A WRITING ASSIGNMENT
Sumer Ryan Doulk
Nature Coast Technical High School, Brooksville, FL

The purpose of this project was to determine if the amount of text time demonstrated by students will affect the amount of mechanical errors in their writing. Mechanical errors being shortening of words, improper use of capitalization, and lack of punctuation. The researcher’s hypothesis stated that if the amount of text time increases then so will the amount of mechanical errors in their writing. To determine this a survey was given to 6th and 8th graders asking them basic question on how much time they text, and basic texting habits. Students where then placed in levels based on their average amount of text time daily, and then the researcher received FCAT prompt essays written by these students. The researcher counted the mechanical errors in the essay, and then the data was compared by the level of texting time. The results indicated a consistent gain in mechanical areas from Level 1 (1-10 tests daily) to level 5 (200 or more text daily). The greatest comparison came between the level 5 students compared to the control group (students who do not text). In 8th grade the level 5 students showed a 4.75 % of errors per student compared to the control group with .25% of errors. In 6th grade level 5 indicated a 4.64% of errors per student compared to the control group with a .33% of errors per student.<br><br>In conclusion the data showed to be conclusive of the hypothesis. Students with the highest daily amount of text time often show the most mechanical errors.

GEMARA AND GEMATRIA: A CASE STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF THE USE OF SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXTUALIZING FOR THE LEARNING OF MATHEMATICS
Tamara Gedankien
Escola Brasileira Israelita Chaim Nachman Bialik, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

My research verified the educational impacts that result from the use of sociocultural contextualizing as teaching methodology. I worked with 87 students in a Jewish school, using elements of the Jewish culture to activate mathematical skills.<br><br>I used the Gematria, which is a system of notation of Hebrew letters, with 25 students in the 4th grade, and a chapter from the Gemara, which consists of rabbinical geometrical commentaries of Jewish oral traditions, with 19 students in the 8th grade. Each group went through a didactic sequence of four one-hour classes, including a slide show, two exercises forms, homework and a test. Control groups (4th grade, 24 students; 8th grade, 19 students) remained in regular math classes. The experimental classes showed a significant improvement in a post-trail test based on SARESP (Evaluation System of Educational Achievements of the State of Sao<br><br>Paulo), stressing the following aspects: SARESP 2008 results showed that only 35% of the 8th grade students in the State of São Paulo presented the ability to recognize geometric representations of the special binomial products. The percentage observed in the control class was 43%, and 74% in the experimental class. In the 4th grade, 69% of the experimental class showed the ability to perform calculations and operations, while the control group had 50%, and the State students verified 34%. The homework assignments for both experimental and control classes were categorized using a qualitative system, and by that, I could compare the homework production among them. Experimental classes also stood out.<br><br>The results indicate amazing learning impacts resulting from sociocultural contextualizing, what should encourage similar research in other cultures. I believe that adopting this methodology will lead to an epistemological plurality. I am currently working to implement this model in my school.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COGNITIVE DEMAND AND STRESS
Chase Tyler Huggins
Saint Charles West High School, Saint Charles, MO

The purpose of this study was to seek out whether stress affects cognitive performance. Cognitive demand is the measurement of how difficult a task becomes to an individual while attempting to solve a problem. Cognitive performance is the measurement of how well an individual completes a task. The participants were asked to complete multiple puzzles while under a time limit. The level of stress was manipulated by the absence (low stress) or presence (high stress) of a large clock placed strategically to ensure visibility. This manipulation of stress caused direct change in the performance of the participants in the high stress group.

LEARNING STYLES AND ADHD: THE UTILIZATION OF VAK METHODOLOGY AND DSM-IV CRITERIA TO ENHANCE EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TO FIND A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING STYLES AND ADHD
Travis Coleman Sigafoos
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects over 7% of school-aged children. ADHD students often have difficulty learning in an educational environment. ADHD prevalence is rapidly increasing and the student researcher wanted to discover a method that could help ADHD students reach their full potential. The student researcher investigated the relationship between ADHD and learning styles. In order to investigate this relationship, the researcher created and utilized VAK Methodology. The VAK Survey, vLSA, aLSA, kLSA, and iLSA were developed by the student researcher in collaboration with professional researchers. The VAK Methodology allowed the student researcher to find students’ learning style preferences and the application of the visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning styles. In order to find the sequence of each student’s inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity levels, the ADHD Self-Report Scale: Symptom Checklist was developed by the student researcher and based on DSM IV-TR (APA, 2000) criteria. The student researcher triangulated the learning style preferences, the v-kLSA sequences, and the ADHD sequences and found a significant relationship between learning styles and ADHD. Also, there is a significant increase in test performance when students understand their learning style preferences. The student researcher believes that educators need to help students understand their learning style preferences in order to help them manage their ADHD symptoms and learn to their best ability.

IT AIN'T OVER 'TIL THE KNOCKOUT MOUSE SINGS
Benjamin Rogers Bauchwitz
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

Fragile X mental retardation is a genetic disease that affects one in 4000 males and often produces a significant negative effect on their ability to speak. One third of people with Fragile X syndrome also have autism, which can lead to severe social disabilities. Fragile X syndrome results from the mutation of the Fmr1 gene, which in turn leads to inadequate Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein being produced. By blocking that same gene in mice, one can create a model of this disorder. My experiment focused on comparing the vocalizations of these knockout mice (ko) with those of normal wild-type mice (wt). These mice, which would normally produce Ultrasonic Vocalizations (USVs), were shown to be nearly silent when placed in social situations with other males. The wt mice, on the other hand, were generally quite vocal. The adult ko mouse results seemed to match what is seen in most people with Fragile X mental retardation, since they have serious problems in speaking, but more than two-thirds do not have autism and are quite social. Mice were also tested in their home cage with a single female who was proven to be silent. Because mice generally vocalize for sexual reasons, it would be quite strange if the ko mice did not vocalize. Mice with the human Fragile X transgene were also investigated because this could give a more direct comparison of mice to humans with Fragile X.

PERCEPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Kelly Elizabeth Liles
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS

This purpose of this study was to determine the effect environmental awareness has on environmental involvement of students ages of 14-18 at Oak Grove High School. A total of 200 participants were given a survey about environmental issues. Once all surveys were completed, it was found that there was a correlation between the perception of participants' environmental views and participants' involvement in activities that protect the environment. Further research should be done to a broader sample size and political views and religious views could be obtained to determine if there is a correlation to environmental issues or if it simply just a stereotype.

NUTRITION EDUCATION IN BRAZILIAN SCHOOLS: A NEW METHODOLOGY
Heitor Geraldo da Cruz Santos
Associacao Educacional e Cultural Arco-Iris, Recife, PE, BRASIL

In Brazil, lack of nutrition teaching methodologies is one of the main obstacles to working with nutrition education. The most deadly diseases in the world are related to poor eating. Adolescence is an important stage of life, formation of healthy eating habits will have repercussions throughout teenagers’ lives, I found it necessary to conduct a research and collect data on nutrient profiles for this age group. Then, I analyzed the data which contributed to the planning of intervention activities in nutrition education, based on specific features of the public. The 1st step of my research was to work on studies that focus on the analysis of dietary habits of teenagers. To do so, I used the 24-hour recall and anthropometric analysis. Thereafter, using the technique "Picture of the Diet" I examined the influence of the school in forming healthy eating habits. After collecting and analyzing information in the 1st step, I could go forward to the 2nd step: developing a methodology for intervention in nutritional education. The methodology is based on principles of social constructivist theory, for which knowledge is constructed recognizing the reality in a critical way, reflecting on it and acting on it. The methodology was tested through lectures in public and private schools and culminated in the development of an orientation booklet for teachers on working with nutritional education in schools. The booklet was submitted to a committee of specialists in the areas of education and nutrition. Their opinions together with the results of the lectures, indicate the efficiency of my methodology. Finally, I focused on social awareness on the need for investment in nutrition education in Brazil, by collecting signatures for a petition, and discussions with government officials.

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT
Alexis Amy Caletka
Holy Savior Menard Central High School, Alexandria, LA

At the core of scientific research are essential questions on the topic of the human personality… What makes us different from each other? Though scientists have been able to define personality—the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make a person unique—the ultimate puzzle lies within the question of what makes us different from one another. Research suggests that people respond to a particular pleasant something in many different ways due to differing personalities. The question arose, does personality type affect eating habits. Based on available research it was predicted that people with differing personality types would choose to eat an Oreo cookie in a different way. The experiment began by giving test subjects an Oreo and video-taping how they ate it. Subjects then took a personality test to see if there was any connection between how each person ate their cookie and their personality type. Each person’s result was then compared to that of the others. Both extroverts and introverts preferred to bite the cookie nearly 2:1 over splitting it. Intuitive personalities were evenly split between biting and splitting, but sensing personalities preferred biting to splitting. Thinking personalities preferred biting to splitting while feeling personalities were evenly split. Perceiving personalities also prefer biting to splitting, while judging personalities are almost evenly split. A specific trend did not appear in the more rare types of eating. The results of this experiment show that a connection does exist between various personality types and eating habits.

ACADEMIC DISHONESTY: FACTORS TO A STUDENT'S SUCCESS
Krupa H. Merchant
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

Purpose of the experiment: What is cheating? This simple question is often asked by many students, teachers, and parents. Why is this question so difficult to answer? Something that one person may consider cheating may not be cheating from another’s vantage point. This is one of the reasons why the academic dishonesty (cheating) occurs in schools. Although some students do not know all the types of cheating, many students continue to cheat even though they are fully aware that their actions are dishonest. This behavior strikes interest, and serves as the purpose of this research project. What influences academic honesty vs. dishonesty in high school students?<br><br>Procedure: Fifty-six high school students were chosen to participate in the survey, seven males and females from each grade 9-12. Once the data was gathered, the answers were disaggregated by gender and grade level. After the results were considered, noticeable differences were communicated in the forms of graphs.<br><br>Data: For those students who cheated most often, it was due to a lack of time. Their major reason was procrastination, while second came the concern for grades. When asked about their motivation for making good grades, a majority of the students claimed that they were intrinsically motivated. Others sited parental pressure followed by peer pressure. <br><br>Conclusions: The researcher believes that dishonesty arises when students realize the hardships of college or want to gain the “easy way out” of high school. This hypothesis was partially accepted and partially rejected. According to the data, only 6% of the students were concerned with college. On the other hand, 24% of the students resulted to cheating because of procrastination and a lack of time.

THE EFFECTS "CHAT" MAY HAVE IN THE WRITTEN COMPOSITION OF TEENAGERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS
Luis Alejandro Vazquez
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

Our society is constantly receiving the effects of technological advances. An example of this affirmation is the prolonged use of “Chat” by teenagers. Our teenagers have created a language that is short and simple. This situation brings controversy and is against the basic principles of the correct usage of grammar. This investigation is concerned with the study of the effect that the prolonged usage of “Chat” will have on written composition of teenagers between the ages of fourteen to sixteen years. A sample of one hundred and fifty teenagers were divided into two groups of seventy five (control and experimental groups respectively). Each group was subject to tests that determined how “Chat” affected their written composition. The experimental group was located in a computer laboratory and divided into three groups of twenty five students. The experimental group used the “Chat” method to write a paragraph which was dictated one sentence at a time. The same paragraph was dictated to the experimental group and written in a loose leaf paper. The purpose of this was to be able to observe and analyze the abbreviations used in “Chat” and how this affects their written composition. The control group was divided into three groups of twenty five students. The same paragraph was dictated to this group. The control group wrote the paragraph in a loose leaf paper. Both, control and experimental groups answered a questionnaire and the results were tabulated and analyzed.

ALGEBRA: NOT THE SAME OLD GAME - EDUCATIONAL GAMING FOR KNOWLEDGE RETENTION
Neil Martin Redfield
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Educational computer games have been around almost as long as the personal computer. However, there have been few long-term studies performed to evaluate their effectiveness. Previous work by the researcher has shown educational gaming to be effective alongside traditional classroom education. The goal of this research was to determine if educational gaming can be applied to promote knowledge retention over a prolonged academic break. It was hypothesized that educational gaming would cause full retention of knowledge, promote greater retention, and there would be a correlation between time played and level of retention.The educational game Math Blaster Algebra, comprehensive for Algebra 1, was evaluated using simple pre- and post-test procedures over the summer break of 2009. The pre-/post-test used consisted of multiple choice questions and was comprehensive for Algebra 1. Subjects (ninth grade Algebra 1 students) were divided into a game group (n=21) and a control group (n=57). Tests were administered before and after the summer break. Game group subjects reported the total time they spent playing Math Blaster Algebra.<br><br>Analysis indicated an increase in knowledge of the game group from pre-test to post-test. There was no correlation between time spent playing and retention level. The number of questions answered by the game group increased from the pre-test to the post-test, indicating increased familiarity with Algebra 1. Control group showed no significant change. In conclusion, since significance was not conclusively affirmed (p=0.050) further repetition is recommended to determine if educational gaming can be effectively applied to promote knowledge retention.

RISKY BUSINESS: WHAT COGNITIVE FACTORS INFLUENCE RISK TAKING IN THE ACADEMIC SETTING?
Joseph Hunter Yagoda
William A. Shine Great Neck South High School, Great Neck, NY

High schools that are developing policies to curb class cutting, cheating, plagiarism, and other risks face a limited amount of pertinent research. Current studies on teenage risk taking focus on health-related risks, often use self-report surveys, and are not commonly conducted in high school settings. This study took into account those limitations, examining risk taking in a high school setting using a behavioral measure as a way to differentiate between risk takers and non-risk takers. Specifically, the risk of class cutting was modeled by an innovative simulation mimicking a prototypical classroom. Following the risk scenario, subjects (n=60) were given cognitive measures, analyzing the perception of the risk’s benefits and harms, peer risk taking, and confidence in avoiding the risk’s harms. Additionally, the General Decision-Making Style (Scott & Bruce, 1995) was utilized to examine potential differences in cognitive styles. Results indicated statistically significant differences, with risk takers having greater perceptions of the risk’s benefit (p=.019), peer risk taking (p<.001), and confidence in avoiding the risk’s harms (p<.001). While the rational thinking style dominated both groups, non-risk takers exhibited more rational thinking (p=.050) as well as less intuitive (p=.016) and spontaneous thinking (p=.007). Results suggest that schools should increase the benefits of attending class, work to minimize the perception of peer risk taking, and have clear enforcement of consequences. Further research will examine the role risk taking plays in choice of profession and job training.

THE EFFECTS OF ISSUE-BASED AND CHARACTER-BASED ATTACK ADS ON INTENT TO VOTE AND PERCEPTIONS OF CANDIDATES
Aaron Michael Levine
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

While many studies have been conducted on how attack ads affect political candidates, this experiment is one of the first to test the comparative effects of character-based and issue-based ads. One hundred eighty-four voters at a school budget election were given a brief description of two candidates in a state senate race and randomly assigned to view a character-based ad, issue-based ad, or no ad at all. Participants then rated their intent to vote in the election and for each of the two candidates on a 6-item, 7-point Likert-type scale. Participants also reported their perceptions of the candidates on 2, 5-item, 7-point bipolar scales. One-way ANOVAS and Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests revealed that, contrary to the findings of previous studies, neither type of attack ad affected perceptions of the sponsor. However, participants who viewed the issue-based ad reported more negative perceptions of the targeted candidate than members of the control group, and people who viewed the character-based ad reported the most negative perceptions of all. Similarly, participants who viewed the character-based attack reported the greatest intent to vote for the sponsor over the target, followed by participants who saw the issue-based ad. Interestingly, both ads increased intent to vote in general with character-based ads again having a greater effect. The implications of these findings on future campaigns, the role of negative advertising, and the potential for reform of the system are discussed.

UNDERSTANDING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS RELATED TO LOW MAMMOGRAPHY ADHERENCE AMONGST LOW-INCOME, URBAN AFRICAN AMERICANS
Kevin Young Xu
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute suggest that women receive an annual mammogram after age 40. Unfortunately, researchers have estimated that up to 50% of low-income urban minorities are not adhering to the standards for mammography screening. The present study sought to examine factors related to low mammography adherence rates amongst low-income, African American women residing in Brooklyn, NY, which has one of the highest breast cancer mortality rates nationwide. In this study, participants (N=100) were surveyed about their knowledge of breast cancer, fatalism, spirituality, and participatory decision making. After a presentation on the importance of breast cancer early detection, participants were surveyed a second time. This study revealed that only 44% of participants were complying with the recommendations for annual mammography screening. Participants who reported receiving annual mammograms tended to have higher levels of breast cancer literacy (p<.01), lower levels of fatalism (p<.05), lower levels of spirituality (p<.01), and higher levels of participatory decision making (p<.05)than participants who did not adhere to the standards for mammography screening. Following the educational intervention, participants indicated significantly higher breast cancer literacy (p<.01). In addition, after intervention, more participants reported that they would obtain a mammogram in the upcoming year (90%) as opposed to before educational intervention (52%, p<.01). This finding highlights the potential of educational presentations to combat the low rates of mammography adherence amongst low-income, urban, African American populations.

THE EFFECT OF CONGRUENT AND INCONGRUENT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ON REMEMBERING THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS
Willa Grace Kerkhoff
Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, OH

People use many different levels of communication when remembering the emotions of others. Using an internet survey, I investigated how well a subject remembered another’s emotions when the facial expression was congruent or incongruent with the stated emotion. Subjects (N=96) viewed faces coupled with a statement made by the pictured person about how they felt. Afterwards, they answered questions about how the subject felt (recognition) and why the subject felt that way (recall). I recorded the scores for congruent and incongruent questions, and then compared those scores between men and women, and between different age groups. I found that, overall, subjects did slightly better on both recall (+0.17 on average out of 8) and recognition (+0.43) questions when the facial expression was congruent with the emotion expressed. Women had a higher average score (+0.8) than men, indicating that women may have greater sensitivity to the feelings of others than men. In older subjects, the average score went down for incongruent facial, but actually increased for congruent expressions. Perhaps as a person's memory becomes less reliable, they focus more on remembering faces than words. Human social interactions involve multiple levels of communication, and they depend on our ability to recall the thoughts and feelings of others. Thus, studying how these different levels of communication contribute to memory formation will help us to understand how our minds function in social evironments.

OBESITY AND DEPRESSION: DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
Sarah Averi Albala
John Jay Senior High School, Cross River, NY

Over 300 million people in the world are obese. It has been shown that obesity can significantly decrease quality of life through its impact on psychological factors including depression. By 2020 depression will become the third leading cause for disability. Previous literature has suggested that depression and obesity are directly related. However the studies that link depression and obesity have limitations. Unlike the simple conclusions drawn from past research, the links between depression and obesity are far more complex. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between obesity and depression in a multiethnic cohort with focus on inclusion of social variables in a series of regression models. This study utilized a cohort of 3,298 urban community residents. Using SAS version 9.2, the relationship between obesity and depression was examined adjusting for social variables including race-ethnicity, stress, gender, and social networks. Race-ethnicity was coded in three different ways to analyze the overall impact of race, and the specific impact that race has on depression and obesity, as well as doing direct comparisons between race-ethnic groups. A multivariable model with obesity as the dependent variable found no significant relationship between obesity and depression. Gender was found to be a strong predictor of both depression and obesity. There were differential findings for the importance of social networks on obesity and depression. These models suggest that race-ethnicity and gender are critical influences on stress as mediators for depression or obesity.

DO PEOPLE READ FASTER AND COMPREHEND BETTER WHEN THEY READ ON PAPER OR ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN?
Lucy Ann Kunzler
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

Electronic media are displacing paper media, particularly with teenagers and young adults. My question is: Do people read faster and comprehend better when they read on paper or on the computer screen? My hypothesis is that those who read from the computer screen will read faster and comprehend better than those who read from paper. I tested 146 people from the ages of twelve to fifteen years old at my school, Orion Jr. High. I performed the actual testing in a computer classroom at the school; the testing went on in six different class periods in the same classroom. Seventy-three students read a passage from paper while being timed. Another seventy-three students read the same passage, on the computer screen, while being timed, and then took the same comprehension test. The average time to complete reading the selected passage for the person using the computer screen was one minute and thirty-three seconds. The average time to complete reading the selected passage for the person using the paper was one minute and fifty-four seconds. The average comprehension score for the students using the computer was 7.8, while the average score for students using paper was 6.8. In conclusion, my hypothesis was supported by my data; people ages twelve to fifteen, do read faster and comprehend better when they read on the computer than when they read on paper.

THE INVESTIGATION OF LATIN AMERICANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES: AN INTERRACIAL SOCIALIZATION STUDY OF AMERICAN AND BRAZILIAN PRE-ADOLESCENTS
Camila Sorese Linneman
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

The changing demography of the United States and census estimations that minorities will become the majority by 2050 raises the question of how our nation’s race relations will change along with it. One hypothesized outcome is termed Latin Americanization, which suggests that the United States will move from a bi-racial system (identifying people as either black or white) to a multi-racial system characteristic of some Latin American countries, such as Brazil. This study aimed to identify if Latin Americanization is occurring in the United States by determining the racial groups pre-adolescents in the U.S. identify, and the effect this has on the willingness to interact with said racial groups (social distance.) Both American and Brazilian pre-adolescents, aged 8-12, were given 20 pictures of a boy and girl, whose only difference was skin color (shades 1-10, taken from the NIS Skin Color Scale.) Participants were asked to divide the pictures into groups by race and to identify which racial group they belonged in. Subjects then completed the adapted Bogardus Social Distance Scale for each group they created, quantifying how socially close they felt to each group. There was no significant difference between the number of racial groups identified by American (M= 3.35) and Brazilian subjects (M=3.56) (t=-.831, p=.407). However, American subjects reported a higher social distance to other racial groups than Brazilian subjects did, despite the similar identification of racial groups (f=.4089, p=.029). These results support a shift toward the multi-racial system characteristic of Latin Americanization.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, DIETARY HABITS, AND HEALTH
Christian Durango
Times Squared Academy, Providence, RI

A first rate society must be conscious of its citizens’ well-being despite socioeconomic status, something as delicate as the health of its members is no exception and must be accounted for. The aim of this exploration was to gauge how large the disparities were between people of different socioeconomic classes, by examining the relationship between socioeconomic status, dietary habits and health. <br><br>The methodology for the investigation required an anonymous survey given to participants who verbally consented. To obtain answers from varying socioeconomic classes surveying was conducted outside of two different businesses, one whose client demographics are significantly more affluent than the other. The survey questioned each participant’s income, eating habits, nutrition awareness, personal and family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity. <br><br>The trends and correlations the results illustrated were evident. Drastic increases in the number of cases of any ailment occurred as the income of the participants decreased. A lack of nutritional awareness was prevalent in those of lower socioeconomic status, while the opposite was true for those of higher socioeconomic status. <br><br>This project brings to light the fact that people of higher socioeconomic status have more nutritional awareness thus enabling them to lead healthier lives than those of lower socioeconomic status. This must be addressed by some form of government intervention in order to adequately take care of all members of society.

Abdulaziz Khalid Alghunaim
Asrary School, RIYADH, central, SAUDI ARABIA

As technology becomes more integrated into our daily life, its role in early education is<br><br>becoming especially important. most educators agree that skills can be divided into three,<br><br>one of the most important is ICT-enhanced (Information and Communication Technology)<br><br>skills. Technology can be used to track development of students skills. Technology is unique<br><br>in that it can provide an interactive and dynamic environment in which students can learn<br><br>and be tested. Specifically technology can be used to evaluate soft skills, which include<br><br>problem solving, teamwork and presentation ability, that despite essential relevance remain<br><br>unevaluated.<br><br>This research aimed to develop a game platform that can measure the ICT-enhanced<br><br>(Information and Communication Technology) skills and soft skills such as problem solving<br><br>for children between 8 and 14 years of age. We use a simple game platform that is developed<br><br>in Scratch R?. Educators can use this tool to measure the improvement of students . This<br><br>simple platform provides a fun way to evaluate students without using regular multiplechoice<br><br>tests.<br><br>This research proved the efficiency of this game. By comparing it to an accurate paperbased<br><br>measurement tool. We chose two groups and applied both the game and the paper<br><br>test to them. We found a correlation of 0.74 between the scores. We found that the test is<br><br>as accurate as the paper-based test. We handed them surveys that measures the students<br><br>tendencies towards both tests. We conducted a t-test which proved that students tend to<br><br>play the computer game rather than taking the paper test.

THE HEARING GLASSES
Mahmoud Motaz Ghulman
Dar Althikr Schools, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

A large number of people worldwide suffer from hearing loss problems. This effects negatively on their communication with the society and their ability to learn. This encouraged the researcher to find a visual alternative to the sense of hearing (The Hearing Glasses). It is supposed to make them able to identify the audio material and improve their interactive communication skills and ability to learn. To prepare to test this purpose, the Researcher began to identify the community of the study and chose the study sample and then worked on preparing the study materials (the “Hearing Glasses”, the demonstrated text, survey, and the test). After that he applied a pilot study on 30 samples and demonstrated his materials to judging from a couple of specialists to ensure the veracity of the materials and their persistence. Finally after applying his experiments on the study sample (120 samples) he analyzed the results of the study descriptively(mean, median,…) and statistically (T-Test and 2-way ANOVA). The results were statistically relevant in regards to the positive feedback from the survey participants and high-test scores. It has been concluded that the "Hearing Glasses" solution are capable of enabling the deaf person a better communication with the surroundings and the ability to identify heard material using the "Hearing Glasses" solution. This solution can benefit the deaf community in the world and help them communicate in a higher method. The researcher is now<br><br>working on finding ways to develop the research material (Deaf Glasses) into a commercial product.

WORKING MEMORY SPAN AND ITS CORRELATION TO GENDER, GPA, SLEEP AND OTHER FACTORS
Kathryn Rose McClintic
Cedarcrest High School, Duvall, WA

This study explores the correlation between working memory span and differences in gender, sleep, hemispheric dominance, and ability to multi-task. It also investigates whether working memory is predictive of academic proficiency. It was hypothesized that working memory span would not vary with gender, but that more sleep and increased ability to multi-task would improve working memory span. It was hypothesized that working memory could be a predictor of academic proficiency and GPA. Nineteen males and twenty one females between ages of 14 and 17 completed two working memory tasks, the Backward Digit Span Task and the Matrices Memory Task. Subjects also completed a demographics survey and a hemispheric dominance survey. The backward digit span and matrices memory span were recorded. The hypothesis regarding gender was supported as gender did not affect performance on working memory tasks. It was also found that individuals who receive 7 to 8 hours of sleep/night perform 15% better on working memory tasks than those who did not. The hypotheses regarding multi-tasking and hemispheric dominance were not supported as there were no correlations identified. In regards to academic proficiency, no correlations were found between working memory span and proficiency in science and GPA. Additionally, working memory span was not found to be significant predictor of proficiency in math and reading. Future research could include a focused examination of the effects of sleep deprivation on working memory task performance in a more controlled environment.

YOU CATCH MORE FLIES WITH HONEY!
James Michael Kobylanski
Rome Catholic High School, Rome, NY

Overall, the purpose of "You Catch More Flies With Honey!" was to prioritize potential cyber security threats at Rome Catholic School, according to critical infrastructure information. This was done in order to illuminate the areas that require more security protocols; security protocols in the form of intrusion detection systems, or "Honey Pots." The main procedure of the experiment included collecting, interpreting, and graphing data harvested from every student at Rome Catholic School in grades seven through twelve. The students selected one of five desirably titled folders that represented actual "High Risk Potential" areas. They include:<br><br>1.) Student Grades<br><br>2.) Wi-Fi Passwords<br><br>3.) Student Disciplinary Records<br><br>4.) Lunch Account Codes<br><br>5.) School Finances<br><br>According to procedure, the subjects then followed directions on a Microsoft Word document contained inside. The directions instructed them to list their gender, age, and grade, as well as to provide a brief explanation that would allow insight to their specific folder selection. The data was sorted and organized into a plethora of groups, including, but not limited to: Gender, Age, Grade, Folder Preference, or any combination of the previous. The experiment concluded after graphing and interpreting the data. Succeeding in the original purpose by locating the areas of Rome Catholic cyber infrastructure that required more security, it was found that "Student Grades" and "School Finances" would benefit in the greatest from added security measures.

THE YOULLA EFFECT: ORIGINAL RESEARCH ON HUMAN FACIAL RECOGNITION BY THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
Grant Perry Samms
Olathe North High School, Olathe, KS

This study was concerned with whether or not subjects would anonymously agree that out of three options, one face looked the most like three givens. Subjects were given thirty seconds to study the facial structure of three given facial photographs. They were then shown three more faces and asked to select which one they felt most “looked like” the three givens. This test was preformed with a set of male faces and with a female set for each subject. After participation by 62 subjects (Set A), the choice photos were shifted one to the right and 18 more subjects (Set B) were tested. Analysis of Set A showed that subjects agreed on the male face 59.68% of the time and agreed on the female face 61.29% of the time. These statistics were found to have less then a .05% chance of being coincidental after analysis by a Chi Squared Test of Goodness of Fit. When separated by gender, the data showed that men agreed on the male face 55.88% of the time, but agreed on the female face 64.71% of the time. Women agreed on the male face 64.29% of the time, but agreed 57.14% of the time on the female face. After the shift, subjects agreed on the same male face from Set A 50% of the time and on the same female face from Set A 61.11% of the time. These changes were not significant enough to indicate position of the picture as a factor in the choice.

PHARMACEUTICAL SAFETY: RISK PERCEPTION AND DRUG ADHERENCE
Michael Joseph Vredenburgh
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, CA

In 1996, Congress passed a law stating that medications must be accompanied by “meaningful” written information. Patients’ perception of a drug’s risk can determine whether or not they read the form, or how much of it they choose to read. There is strong evidence supporting the importance of expectations on warning efficacy. Specifically, warning effectiveness tends to increase as a function of perceived hazardousness and likelihood of injury. One of the most dangerous commonly prescribed medications is Warfarin, which has a low, or narrow, therapeutic index. This means that even a small excess of two to two and a half times normal can be fatal in 50% of the population. A primary aim of this study was to evaluate how the format of information sheets influences risk perception and drug adherence. I created an experimental information sheet for Warfarin for this study by reformatting existing sheets to comply with results of my prior science fair research and compared it to 2 existing sheets (one commonly used by pharmacy chains and one by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) using a comprehension test that I developed for the study. I used 2 Likert-type scales to evaluate risk perception, and likelihood of injury. I compared the 2 existing sheets to my experimental sheet using a repeated measures ANCOVA (using age as a covariate). I found that as the perception of risk increased, performance on a test increased when the information sheet was difficult to use. Results indicate that participants underestimated risk for all formats, which could potentially result in serious injury or death. Since seniors use significantly more drugs, and the more drugs taken the greater risk of injury, it is critical that these sheets are redesigned to accurately convey risk to seniors and all population groups.

THE PREDICTABILITY AND ABSTRACTNESS OF LANGUAGE: A STUDY IN UNDERSTANDING AND USAGE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THROUGH PROBABILISTIC MODELING AND FREQUENCY
Revanth Kosaraju
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

Theories of language acquisition differ significantly in their treatment of the extent of abstractness versus predictability in language. This experiment seeks to clarify the issue by studying an important related topic: quantitatively determining frequency of occurrence of a word or phrase in the English language. Four probabilistic models for frequency were studied. Three widely used models (Markov, general construction, and independent probability) represented abstract learning. A new chunk model which determines frequency based on the occurrence of entire sequences of words was developed by the researcher and was used to represent prediction-and-error learning. To compare the theoretical predictions of each model with real-life language processes, 31 children between the ages of 3 and 4 were tested for proficiency of repetition and comprehension using 28 pairs of high and low frequency expressions. The repetition/comprehension accuracies and delay times were recorded. This data was analyzed for statistical significance and was subsequently compared with each of the four probabilistic models individually. A standard t-test determined that repetition accuracy for the chunk model was the sole significant measure (t-stat=2.18, p<0.05). Essentially, proficiency of repetition was greater for high-frequency expressions than for their lower frequency counterparts, but comprehension was not affected by frequency. Through a formula of correspondence established by the researcher, the chunk model was deemed 73.5% correspondent with the data from the child study and supported the hypothesis that language is not entirely abstract but contains prediction-and-error processes. The chunk model can be used to identify lower-frequency phrases that children have trouble learning.

EFFECTS OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM ABOUT MELALEUCA QUINQUENERVIA IN THE ATTITUDE OF COMMUNITIES' STUDENTS LIVING ADJACENT TO TORTUGUERO LAGOON
Elias K Pabon
Lino Padron Rivera, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

Tortuguero Lagoon is an important ecosystem for migratory birds and there are 23 native species living there. During recent years the invasive species Melaleuca quinquenervia is a threat to the wetlands ecosystem. The Puerto Rico Natural Resources Department works to eliminate the species from the lagoon, but in nearby communities the species is growing without control. Communities around the ecosystem do not have knowledge about the problem. That is why an Educational Program is necessary to change people’s attitude towards this invasive species. The hypothesis is that the change of attitude among communities’ students is proportional to the type of educational program offered. <br><br> This investigation developed an Educational Program to change the student’s attitude towards the species. Attitude included 3 components: cognitive, affective and behavior. The study included students living in adjacent communities of Tortuguero Lagoon. A pretest was used to evaluate the attitude before treatment. To determine the effect of the Educational Program the sample was divided into 3 groups: control, which did not receive treatment; experimental 1, which received a conference about the problem, and experimental 2, which received a conference about the problem and an excursion to the lagoon. A posttest was given after treatment to determine changes in attitude.<br><br>Change in attitude was significant among experimental groups. They shifted to a positive attitude, rising from 29% to 76% in experimental 1 and from 38% to 85% in experimental 2. It is concluded that the treatment modified the attitude towards the plant in a positive way.

THE ONE DOLLAR AUCTION
Alec Burton Howard
Deer Valley High School, Antioch, CA

A one-dollar auction is a “game” in which a group of about 5 people bid on one dollar. However, there is a catch: both the highest and second highest bidder have to pay. It was hypothesized that teenagers would bid higher than adults because they are impulsive. This is a reasonable hypothesis since it is generally accepted that most teenagers are known to be less deliberate with their actions than adults. All volunteers were made to believe that real money was at stake. Once the experiment was finished and the results recorded, a t-test was performed based on the results. The t-test showed that the probability of difference between the two demographics was due to chance is .445, or 44.5%. This means that there is a high chance that if the test was conducted again, the same results would appear. Likely not based on coincidence, one noticeable difference between the two genders is the fact that male and female bidders were the first and second highest bidders, respectively, among the adult population. However, much more testing is needed to determine whether this is just random chance or something much greater. The resulting average highest bid for teenagers and adults, respectively, was $2.12 and $1.41 while the average second highest bid for teenagers and adults, respectively, was $1.84 and $1.25. Therefore, since the difference wasn’t very significant, one can infer that teenagers and adults are, for the most part, similar in their impulsiveness.

HOLLAND CODE QUIZ AND PERSONAL CHOICES
Bayan H. Abdallat
Dove Science Academy, Oklahoma City, OK

Many kids get asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” However, as the child does grow and becomes a teenager, their thoughts about jobs might change. Then, as the teenager grows older and goes to college, they might want to become something different. The Holland Code quiz was given to students to check the relation between their personal career choices and the results of the quiz.<br><br>Students took the test voluntarily, and the data was analyzed. <br><br>After analyzing the results, the hypothesis was proven to be correct. The 12th graders, the highest grade surveyed, had the most students with compatible results. The grade that had the least compatible results was 9th grade. The 12th grade had the highest degree of compatibility most likely because the seniors are getting prepared for college and choosing their majors. The 9th grade likely had the least compatibility due to the fact that they had just entered high school and their ideas about jobs may still be forming because they now have to become more realistic about their choices. Once the analysis of the graphs was complete, the Social personality career prevailed throughout all the grades. In conclusion, the higher the grade, the more compatible the results became.<br><br>

The purpose of this project is to investigate correlations between recreational activities (RA) and general knowledge level (GKL), the study considered types of (RA) and its specific effect on GKL as well. <br><br> Existence of directly proportional relationship between GKL and variation of RA was hypothesized. In addition, RA which have the highest efficiency on GKL are not the most widely practiced among university students.<br><br>Our study has been accomplished on two phases. Firstly, a pilot study using a survey designed by the researcher was conducted randomly in different universities on (200) university students in Alexandria city to measure the impact of other variables (Age, gender, Grade, working status, University, Faculty, financial status, Parent’s educational qualifications, area of living) on GKL. Secondly, and with respect to the first phase results, the same survey was achieved on random sample of 500 university student to determine their RA and test their GKL. <br><br>Pearson correlation coefficient where applied and results assured the hypothesis. Further analysis, using One Way ANOVA identified that the best GKL is obtained while reading along with reciting Quran and doing researches.<br><br>Watching television is the most widely practiced recreational activity among university students. As (88%) of the sample, with (37.19%) considers it their most practiced RA.

SLOW IT DOWN TO SPEED IT UP: BREAKING THROUGH THE WINDOW OF AUTISM
Adelina Corina Cozma
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, Ontario, CANADA

Recent magnetoencephalographic studies suggest that auditory processing deficits are key in the communication and socialization problems observed in autism. The present research investigates whether artificially modified speech, using the latest digital audio-video technology, can improve the temporal processing deficit that occurs in autistic children. Thirteen high-functioning autistic children and thirteen age-matched controls completed emotional and non-emotional auditory processing tasks incorporated in three innovatively developed software program games. The accuracy and response times of the two groups were compared when consonant-vowel syllable pairs were slowed down or sped up. Time-stretching of syllables improved processing of auditory information in all participants, especially in the autistic volunteers. The autistic children demonstrated a left ear preference and right brain hemispheric lateralization tendency for non-emotional auditory processing, which is a reversed ear preference and hemispheric dominance in comparison with the controls. Both groups processed emotional approach-related stimuli better than withdrawal-related stimuli. This finding indicates a left brain lateralization tendency for emotional auditory processing in both autistic and typically developing children. Establishing each subject’s optimal artificially time-stretched speech rate of auditory processing led to the development of an innovative educational system, personalized for each individual’s specific needs, based on a world-class real-time and file-based media encoding system. Time-stretching technology can not only improve the lives of people with autism and other learning disabilities, but also those of typically developing individuals and foreign language learners.

SOCIAL EXPERIENCE MODULATES DROSOPHILA AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR
Andrew Wooyoung Kim
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

Social experience is a natural occurrence in organisms and significantly impacts the creation of feelings, behavior, and overall, actions pursued. This joint interaction is shown to have drastic effects on two major neuropsychological functions: aggression and learning. In humans, learning triggers brain growth caused by distinct habitualizations of synaptic connections. However in fruit flies, learning from olfactory receptors stimulates mushroom body growth. In contrast, social limitation decreases mushroom body size, leading to an increase in aggression. Previous studies have shown that socially inexperienced flies express more aggressive behavior and possess smaller mushroom bodies compared to socially experienced flies. The purpose of my project is to determine the effect of social experience on synaptic protein expression in Drosophila. Individuals have various experiences during their lifetime that impact subsequent behaviors. I hypothesize that social experience influences aggressive behavior and gene expression in the brain. <br><br> The amount of social experience was limited through isolation at the egg, larva, and adult stage. Adult flies were observed for aggression, and dissected for brain observation under a confocal microscope. Protein expression and brain size were measured. Brains were also used for Western blotting analysis.<br><br> My data shows that social experience significantly affects Drosophila aggressive behavior and synaptic protein expression of Bruchpilot in the brain. More experienced flies have bigger mushroom bodies, and a higher expression of Bruchpilot, but do not display aggression. Therefore, the synaptic brain protein, Bruchpilot, can be used as a potential indicator of gene expression in the brain associated with aggressive behavior.

VOTING SYSTEMS: AN OUTCOME ANALYSIS, PHASE TWO
Vikash Evans Hypio
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

Phase I, last years project, tested different voting systems to see if they produced different outcomes; Phase II of the project focuses on applying some of those same voting systems to a practical application, that of predicting the amount for a school bond issue that would be agreeable to most voters. It was hypothesized that an analysis of the voting results would be useful in predicting passability.<br><br> Five hundred registered voters were random sampled and mailed surveys. The survey was designed to assess the amount of money that the community would support for a bond issue. Five voting systems were used to tally the votes, including a method based on the “many wrongs” theory.<br><br> The $10 million issue won in three of four voting systems, and $14.4 million was the mean of the “many wrongs” system. In a follow-up survey 53% of the voters supported the $14.4 million bond, showing it to be the upper limit. 78% of the voters passed the $10 million bond, indicating an amount highly likely to pass.

ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVEL PATTERNS IN RESPONSE TO HORMONAL FLUCTUATION ACROSS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE
Carolina Jaramillo
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

This study intended to assess anxiety and depression patterns in correlation to follicle-stimulating, luteinizing, estrogen and progesterone level fluctuations. Comprehensive in its ethnic diversity and consideration of change over time, this study recorded the anxiety and depression patterns of 38 teenaged female students using retrospective surveying adapted from the BAI/BDI at four one-week intervals. This study amassed data yielding the following pattern: both depression and anxiety scores showed gradual decline, especially in the follicular phase where the average anxiety score decline was about 47% and depression score decline was about 45%. The most severe score average was observed in Week 1 retrospection which assessed the pre-menstrual stage, consistent with the drop in progesterone and estrogen and faint increase of FSH. The results partially supported the hypothesis because the most severe anxiety and depression scores were indeed observed at the drop of estrogen and progesterone, but they did not coincide with the peak of FSH, but a faint increase in FSH. Week 3 and 4 retrospection demonstrated the lowest anxiety and depression scores as estrogen and progesterone peaked and FSH and LH cruised low. The study concluded that the severest anxiety and depression symptoms do occur in the week prior to menstruation (PMS); however, the severity does not disappear after menstruation. Instead, severity gradually declines in Week 2, and drops consistently through Week 3 and Week 4, indicating that the absence of estrogen and progesterone indirectly leads to an increase in anxiety/depression symptoms.

DETERMINING THE EFFICACY OF BRAIN SYNCHRONIZATION TRAINING ON SUBJECTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS
Danielle Nicole Scheer
Pine Crest School, Fort Lauderdale, FL

Brain Synchronization Training (BST) is a combination of spectrally altered music stimulation combined with physical and mental activities. The training is designed to increase stimulation to sensory and motor areas within and between the two cerebral hemispheres in a time locked manner, with the intention of enhancing distributed neural networks for improved information processing. In order to have better signal processing at the cortex, it is believed that there must first be improved transmission of neural impulses through the brainstem. This research utilized the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) as a physiological marker pre and post BST to evaluate changes in neural synchrony at the brainstem level with a sound stimulus. ABR absolute and interpeak latencies were examined for each ear using click stimulus rates of 19.1 and 59.1 clicks/second; Wave V latency and amplitude values were analyzed to examine binaural summation pre and post BST. All subjects in the developmentally delayed subject group showed a positive increase in wave V amplitude, which is interpreted as an increase in neural synchrony.

PREDICTABILITY: UNDERSTANDING HOW AND WHY WE DEVELOP FIRST IMPRESSIONS AND HOW PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS RELATE TO HAVING PREDICTABLE RESPONSES TO IMAGE AND SOUND
Megan Elizabeth Gilliland, Isaiah Butler, Boston Portner
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, MN

From eyes, to attire, to voice clarity, every characteristic of a person is used to create lasting first impressions. Though these assumptions are intrinsic to social interaction, they are one-dimensional in understanding and accuracy. This project is aimed at establishing how simplistic and shallow first impressions are by quantitatively demonstrating how often perceptions can be predicted.<br><br> The first impressions were drawn out through open-ended responses, multiple choice questions, and comparisons of pictures. The 300 subjects gave their first impressions of 24 pre-chosen pictures and five audio phrases of unknown people. Data was analyzed by comparing the responses to predicted connotations and exactly worded predicted answers, as well as finding patterns using demographic traits of the subjects. <br><br> The results showed that, of first impressions, 54.91% were exactly predicted and 69.31% were of the predicted connotation. These results support the theory, that at least 50% of the participants’ first impressions could be predicted word for word and a significant amount of the first impressions’ connotations would be predictable. Ideas that support our theory include: the use of schemas; which are the mental maps we create of our experiences, the fundamental attribution error theory; which states that humans assume that a person has a consistent personality based solely on one action or trait, and the implicit personality trait theory; which states that people assume a person has a certain disposition at all times after only seeing them once. <br><br> Results of the test were distributed to the community, and hopefully, this experiment will deter relying on first impressions by showing the predictability of responses.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AND TEST SCORES IN WISCONSIN
Jamie Lea Ginther, Tyler Tullius, 
Cochrane-Fountain City High School, Fountain City, WI

The ACT test, or American College Testing program, has been a standard college-entrance and high school achievement exam since 1959. The ACT is taken more than the SAT exam in every state but the East and West coast states of the U.S. The WKCE test is a mandatory test taken by 10th grade students in Wisconsin. This research seeks to find a correlation between ACT test scores and WKCE test scores and socio-economic factors in the state of Wisconsin, by analyzing sets of data available to the public via the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Public Instruction. Data on population, population density, median household income, poverty level, and percent of white persons for each county in Wisconsin was taken from the United States Census Bureau. The data for ACT composite scores and WKCE proficiency scores for each school district in Wisconsin were taken from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. The data was recorded to an Excel spreadsheet, and then analyzed to find Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients, as well as P-Values. A regression analysis was conducted as well. These tests were created for many combinations of test scores versus socio-economic factors. The results of the experiment found a correlation between these sets of data, the strongest correlation being between Poverty Level and the test scores. A majority of the analysis done in the experiment had supported the hypothesis, concluding that there is a relationship between the variables tested.

CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION OF AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE ATTITUDES OF PARENTS OF TEENAGERS TOWARD REGGAETON
Isamar Mayol-Calderon, Coral M. Reyes-Ortiz, 
Episcopal Cathedral School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Reggaeton has become a very popular genre among children and adolescents. Allegedly, too much exposure to it may lead to three fundamentals problems: uncontrolled sexuality, violence and drugs. Many times, this situation causes clashes in the relationships between parents and teenagers and between generations. The purpose of this project was to construct and validate an instrument to meassure parents of teenagers attitudes toward reggaeton, to facilitate future investigation in this area. This goal was fully achieved. A pool of 64 items, where validated. The instrument was then constituted by 47 items which were administered to 100 parents of teenagers. After administering the sample,the discriminatory capacity of the items was evaluated through the Biserial Correlation index. The new version of the instrument was composed of 32 items. The final form of the instrument otained an internal consistency coefficient Alpha of Cronbach of .93. This is considered a good reliability index. The discriminatory power of the questionnarie was assessed by the Delta of Ferguson Formula, were a coefficient of .98 was obtained. This means that the instrument discriminates well between different levels in the attitudes measured. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores for mothers and fathers. There was no significant difference in their attitudes toward reggaeton. We concluded that the instrument demonstrated a high level of reliability, validity and discriminatory power, providing a solid base for futures studies.

THE STUDY OF THE PLACEBO EFFECT IN RELATION TO PROBIOTIC YOGURT
Kaystin Lynn Weisenberger, Lydia Harvengt,

A placebo is any product that is able to induce effects beyond that of its pharmacological benefits. Typically, a placebo effect is generated by a combination of expectancy, motivation, and conditioning. This study identified a placebo in a popular probiotic yogurt which uses advertising to claim regulation of the digestive system. To test this yogurt as a placebo, researchers provided thirty middle-aged women with probiotic yogurt, looking to identify if advertising inspired claims of greater improvement. The hypothesis is that the advertising techniques used by the probiotic yogurt generate a placebo in consumers. Through self-reporting, women rated their digestive health before and after eating the probiotic yogurt. They also rated the effect they believed the yogurt to have. The two ratings were then statistically compared between groups who received different exposure to the probiotic yogurt's advertising. The data shows that the probiotic yogurt induces a placebo effect through its advertising that renders benefits beyond the expected pharmacological effects.

It is known that among the several global environmental problems, the solid waste is a concerning factor that is related to us. It is still a challenge deal with the problem of production and disposal of waste in the educational process, because the environmental education is still handled in a theoretical and punctual way. This project aims to develop environmental education practices which focus on a solid waste management, involving the community in order to influence it and make it aware that local actions bring global consequences. We divide the actions in workshops: waste collection, recycling and paper production of biodegradable inks. Each workshop consists of a cluster of initiatives that involve theoretical and environmental, social, educational and scientific practical activities. The workshops showed significant results at world level, addressing issues such as water, energy expenditure and release of CO2. We highlight the following results: the water can be reused in the process of recycling paper avoiding its waste, in relation to the energy wasted can be seen that for three hundred sheets of paper from virgin fiber is consumed power 22.8 kW / h while for the manufacture of recycled papers will be spent 2.4 kW / h of energy. The process of recycling paper also contributes to reducing the release of CO2 (gas causing the greenhouse effect) that is a global problem. These results reveal a working foundation with the principles of sustainability, in other words, economically viable, ecologically correct and socially just.

MYSTERIES OF AUTISM
Nupur Manoj Shambharkar, Jessica Rice, 
Winston Churchill High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether different teaching methods would enhance the cognitive ability and communication skills of an autistic student. A compare and contrast study was conducted of the "teacher directed" versus the "student directed" teaching styles. A developmental and behavioral health professional supervised the project. The experiment consisted of eight trials in which two teaching methods were utilized. Lessons in basic math, reading/writing, and communications skills were conducted on a weekly basis for three months. The student's progress was observed and recorded after each trial. Baseline data on the subject's performance with the "teacher lead method" was provided by a Autistic treatment facility. The data of the "student directed method" was compared to the "teacher directed method." <br><br>The cognitive level of an Autistic subject was enhanced, and a positive outcome was noted by utilizing different methods of “student directed” teaching. In conclusion, the "student directed method" significantly improved the subject's communication and cognitive skills, when compared to the "teacher directed method."

ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION ON LEARNING BEHAVIOR AND COGNITIVE DEFICIT IN A DROSOPHILA MODEL: A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY
Shaunak Krishan Bakshi, Peter Hans Massey, 
Manhasset Senior High School, Manhasset, NY

Chronic Sleep insufficiency, or deprivation, affects around 70 million Americans, yet it is under recognized as a public health problem. Approximately 29 % of adults in the U.S. report sleeping fewer than 7 hours per night. Previous studies have suggested that there is a link between sleep and memory, and that deprivation may affect learning ability. In this study, the effects of Sleep Deprivation on learning behavior were examined over time, in the form of classical conditioning responses, in Canton-S (Wild-Type) and UAS-APP (Alzheimer’s Model) Drosophila. Each line was bred and divided into four groups – one control, and three variables that were deprived of sleep for varying periods of time. Olfactory Associative Learning ability was tested in the Drosophila using Shock-Avoidance Pavlovian Conditioning. In the training procedure, Drosophila were exposed to an odor, paired with application of electric shock in interval sessions. Testing was performed four days-post training - avoidance of the shock-associated odor signified long-term memory formation. The effects of sleep deprivation on learning were tested at different stages in the fly life span. Data were collected through calculation of performance indices, and were then statistically analyzed. Sleep Deprivation significantly decreased learning ability in Canton-S flies, and worsened memory deficit in UAS-APP Drosophila. The results suggest that sleep deprivation may impact subsequent learning and memory and may also play a role in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s.

GAINING INSIGHT INTO THE LIVES OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE A CHILD WITH "SPECIAL NEEDS": A NATIONWIDE STUDY OF "TYPICALLY DEVELOPING" SIBLINGS
Tyler Hayden Lipperman, Elyse Blueglass, Morgan Blueglass
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Countless therapies and efforts are dedicated to help children with “special needs”; however, very few therapies and efforts are dedicated to helping their “typically developing” siblings. A survey was created measuring the behaviors, attitudes, and views of “typically developing” children towards their sibling with “special needs.” Over 1,300 surveys were sent to members of sibling support/special needs groups in 40 states across the nation. Some of the most significant findings are as follows. If children considered themselves educated on their siblings disability, they were more likely to report “understanding” of the limitations their sibling has a result of their disability (r = .374, p < .01). If children are asked to share the responsibility of taking care of their sibling with “special needs”, they reported (far more often) that they feel "loving" and "understanding" towards their sibling with “special needs” (r = .35, p < .01). Those children whose parents did not have a discussion with them regarding who will be the primary guardian of the sibling with “special needs” in the future, often reported themselves as afraid about the situation more than those who did have a conversation about it (r = -.274, p < .01). These findings will hopefully give parents a better understanding of how siblings of a child with “special needs” may feel and the dynamics involved in those feelings. Future research will focus on adults who grew up with a sibling with “special needs” to study what changes and/or similarities are reported by adults in comparison with the findings of this study.

EXAMINING TOP-DOWN CONTROL IN COGNITION AND PERCEPTION
Alina Lesnovskaya, Charlotte Kleiman, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Top-down methods of control are involved in various regions of the brain, including networks involved in the fundamental functions of cognition and perception. The ability to reduce conflict during a Stroop task is known to be modulated by a preceding trial’s congruency type, characteristic of a cognitive mechanism known as conflict adaptation, in which conflict is detected and subsequently control processes involved in conflict reduction are implemented. It is unknown how this reduction of conflict is affected by the length of time between the provoking and present stimuli. Research previously published by others concerning perceptual networks has also shown that when viewing ambiguous figures, perceptual switches occur due to competition among opposing interpretations. It has recently been observed that there is a dominant interpretation of the stimulus, known as the “default perception”. The underlying neural mechanisms of the default network and perceptual switching remain poorly understood. We determined the duration of time the conflict reduction effect lasts for and how image priming affects the malleability of a default network. Our behavioral results suggest conflict reduction is consistently prevalent in all inter-trial interval durations (mean current trial- previous trial reaction time across all intervals = -.028 ms), predicting a neurocircuitry responsible for this persistent modulation of control. Results also suggest that the default perceptions of a bilateral, ambiguous figure were manipulated by image priming for approximately 48% of trials, emphasizing the malleability of the complex but easily influenced visual processing system. Further research may continue to investigate the anatomic aspects of these results using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

THE EFFECTS OF AN ACTION VIDEO GAME ON REDUCING THE GENDER GAP IN GEOMETRY SCORES
Angela Lee, Klaudia Kluzinski, 
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills, NY

According to PISA, the Program for International Student Assessment, the gender gap in math is present at the age of fifteen in 49 of the 57 participating countries. It is believed that geometry skills can be improved by increasing spatial ability. It has been found that playing action video games showed improvement in spatial ability. In this experiment, Descent 2, a 3-dimensional video game, was used to determine whether playing action video games might help increase students’ spatial ability and improve geometry scores. Scores from two groups of high school students (control and experimental) were compared using a SAT based geometry pre- and post-test. We hypothesized that female students would score lower than males in the pre-test but would score the same or higher in the post-test. We found that the experimental group increased their score by 8 points over the control group, suggesting that playing Descent 2 helped improve geometry scores. Both male and female students in the experimental group were found to increase their scores by 15 points; however, little or no difference in scores was found between male and female students. These findings suggest that video games requiring students to improve their spatial ability may improve geometry scores.

HOW MUCH DOES TEXTING AFFECT THE HUMAN REACTION TIME?
Jacob Raymond Tschetter, Chris Aslesen, 
Florence High School, Florence, SD

The student researchers proposed to determine how texting affected human reaction time.<br><br> The student researchers hypothesized that texting would slow the human reaction time by a dramatic amount, affecting a person’s reaction time. <br><br> The researchers performed two different tests on 30 people. The first test was an audio test where the subjects had to listen to an article while texting a pre-made message. Every time a key word was said, the subject rang a bell to acknowledge that they heard the word. The reaction time was the difference between when the word was said and when the subject rang the bell. This test was repeated by the subject listening to the article without texting to time the difference in the subject’s reaction time. <br><br> The student researchers used the Top End Sports website for a visual reaction program as their second -visual- test. The subject read a text message that the researchers wrote while following the program’s instructions. <br><br> This test was repeated by having the subject follow the computer program’s instructions again, only without texting of any kind. Each test from the website gave the student researchers accurate computer-generated time intervals of how long it took the subject to react, and were recorded accordingly.<br><br> The results of the auditory test of 30 subjects show an increase in reaction time of 55.6% when texting versus non-texting. The visual test resulted in an increased reaction time of 59.5% texting versus non-texting.<br><br> The students concluded that the tests supported their original hypothesis.

AN EXPERIMENT INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF COGNITIVE SCAFFOLDING ON MATH TEST PERFORMANCE
Sterling Ripley-Phipps, Jameson Schwab, 
Yosemite High School, Oakhurst, CA

This is an experiment designed to investigate the effects of cognitive scaffolding on math test performance as measured by the mean score received on a standardized math test where test questions are ordered from easy-to-hard (ETH/ scaffolding) or hard-to-easy (HTE/ no scaffolding). Scaffolding, in education, is the concept of disassembling, arranging, and teaching complex concepts in an easy-to-hard order. The experimental group (n=27; 15 Females and 12 Males) and the control group (n=30; 12 Females and 18 Males) consisted of an opportunity sample of 16-18 year olds from two Advanced Placement Environmental Science classes. The participants were predominately Caucasian students from a rural high school in Central California. The experiment was carried out during two class periods with two separate math tests composed of the same ten problems selected from the standardized Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). In the first test, the questions presented were ordered from HTE. In the second test, the question order was exactly reversed; the questions were ordered from ETH. The independent variable was the order of the questions based upon difficulty, and the dependent variable was the score received on the math test. A one-tailed t-test demonstrated that there was significance at the p < .005 level, showing that test scores were positively influenced by the presence of cognitive scaffolding at the 99.5 % level of confidence. This implies that cognitive scaffolding helps to reaffirm the basic principles necessary for complex problem solving and suggests that test scores can be improved by ordering test difficulty progression from easy to difficult. Teachers should be mindful of the order in which they test concepts.

A FUNCTIONAL MRI STUDY OF BRAIN ACTIVATION DURING THE READING OF MUSIC
Cara Marie Borelli, Qiuzi Zhu, Timothy Alexander Ochsner
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The goal of this project was to determine if musicians undergo the same process as those established by studies in language comprehension, which explore subjects’ responses to their own language versus a language they do not speak. This study was designed to investigate the areas of the brain activated by reading sheet music, focusing specifically on the motor cortexes. This could indicate muscle memory due to musicians recalling subconscious brain processes. A specialized type of MRI scan called functional MRI was used, which shows the regions of the brain that are activated through the analysis of blood-oxygen levels. Eight subjects were tested: four musicians and four non-musicians (as the control). Three paradigms were developed. For the first, subjects first tapped their fingers to help reveal their motor cortexes. For the second, they read sheet music they were familiar with, and for the third paradigm, they read a series of notes without a staff in order to locate the regions of the brain activated by eye movement and eliminate brain activity unrelated to the comprehension of music. The results of this study showed that the musicians showed activity in the pre-motor and motor cortexes while reading music, as opposed to the non-musicians who showed no activity in the motor areas. This study helps further the understanding of the regions of the brain and their associated functions, and has potential medical relevance. Reading music is a possible method for aiding patients who have been paralyzed by a stroke to build new motor connections in the brain.

This study attempts to investigate the economic and environment impacts of the development of that so called Tanjung Api-Api port, which is located in South Sumatera province, Indonesia. <br><br>To generate the data needed, both primary and secondary data, the study has applied a series of method, namely: literature review, observation, distributing questionnaire to the community along the road (20 persons), and conducting interview with more-less 10 selected key informants.<br><br>Our research findings suggest that, the development of the Tanjung Api-Api port has resulted in two conflicting impacts. On one side, the construction of main road to Tanjung Api-Api port has an impact on increasing economic opportunities to the community along the road, such as: a) the opening opportunity for the people to run new small business; b) the opening opportunity to become employees in the new established industries along the road side. On the other side, the development of Tanjung Api-Api port also has an impact on the ecosystem deterioration, both along the road and around the port, such as: the destruction of animal's habitat, forest preservation and mangrove forest, as well as water pollution.<br><br>Based on the above research findings, this study suggests: a) government should re-arrange or to re-settle the community's houses and the stalls along the road side to the Tanjung Api-Api port; b) government should do re-forestation around the port; c) the community and government should work together to run waste disposal treatment; d) government and non-government organization should do more environment counseling to the community.

PERSPECTIVE REGARDING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN PUERTO RICO'S AGRICULTURE
Rafael Rodriguez, Kiara Rivera, 
High School Juana Colon, Comerio, PUERTO RICO

This research was to investigate the Puerto Rican rural and urban population’s knowledge about the use and management of biotechnology in agriculture, also known as green biotechnology. The hypothesis was that the perspective of people from the rural zone regarding the use and management of biotechnology in agriculture will be despective, in comparison whith people from the urban zone, due to the lack of knowledge about biotechnology. <br><br>Fifty persons from the rural zone and fifty persons from the urban zone were selected to participate in the investigation. The investigation was divided into two stages. The instrument used in each stage was a questionnaire. The first questionnaire was given to identify the participant’s prior knowledge about biotechnology. The second questionnaire was given to the participants after receiving a brief orientation about agricultural biotechnology. In many cases, there was a negative feedback identified through the questionnaires. There were some subjects that expressed their support to biotechnology but presented resistance in some areas. Some subjects did not agree with biotechnology due to their religious beliefs. There were many persons who did not agree with food manipulation by biotechnology. In conclusion, it can be stated that the majority of the persons in the investigation did not know that some foods are manipulate and modified genetically and that they might be consuming. Since biotechnology is used daily in Puerto Rico it should be included in the school curriculum to educate people about it. Consumers have the right know what kind of food they are consuming.

BANJO PICKIN' MUSIC: GOOD FOR THE MIND? THE EFFECT OF BLUEGRASS MUSIC ON 11TH GRADE GRAMMAR TEST SCORES
Meredith Claire Brick, Bailey Keith, 
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, MO

<br><br>This project was to discover if listening to bluegrass music while studying affects grammar test scores of 11th grade students. We predicted grammar scores would improve after students listened to music while studying the daily grammar lesson and taking the test. <br><br>We discussed human risk of the tested subjects with our counselor and principals who approved replacing student names with ID numbers to provide anonymous test scores. We made a schedule that split classes into three groups, dependent on their class size and cumulative class GPA. We carried out three trials and set three cycles for each group; cycle one was control with no music, cycle two was music played while studying and during the test, and cycle three was music played only during the test. We used the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to determine if there were statistically significant results between the average test scores in each group.<br><br>Our results showed that out of nine cycles, six cycles had little or no significant evidence supporting our hypothesis. Two cycles showed suggestive significant evidence and one cycle showed moderate significant evidence. <br><br>We conclude bluegrass music doesn’t help or hurt the average student with grammar lessons, although some students did benefit from studying with the music and enjoyed the music. If we continue research, we would allow students to choose preferred genre. We would also want to introduce studying with music to 9th grade students to develop healthy study habits with music.<br><br><br><br>

ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS
Emily Leona Welch
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the relationships between broad domains of health behaviors and a wide range of types of psychological distress. It was hypothesized that there would be a statistically-significant correlation between overall self-reported positive health behaviors and levels of overall psychological distress. 1,000 college students were recruited to participate in this online study. They were asked to complete a self-report measure consisting of four scales: the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the Health Behaviors Checklist (HBC), the Infrequency Scale, and the Abbreviated Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. A Pearson correlation was performed on the global score from the BSI and each subcategory of the HBC. The correlation coefficient between the global BSI score and the total HBC score was was found to be -.18. The hypothesis was accepted because the p-value (p<.001) shows the model is statistically significant. Several stepwise regressions were performed to investigate which dimension of the BSI had the most effect on each subcategory of the HBC. Hostility was the most dominant of the nine BSI dimensions, appearing in all models but the Accident Control model. Estimates suggest that as many as 50% of all U.S. deaths are attributable to preventable poor health behaviors. Further investigation on this relationship could help people with several types of self-reported psychological distress take preventative steps to avoid negative health behaviors and their potentially deadly side effects, such as cancer, hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes.

DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF DISTRACTIONS BEHIND THE WHEEL ON TEENAGERS THROUGH THE USE OF DRIVING SIMULATION
Callie Marie Johnson
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this project was to determine which distraction behind the wheel has the most negative effect on a teenager’s driving performance. A driving simulator was used for this project to test each participant. He or she took five tests – a test without distractions, while talking, while eating, while tuning an iPod, and while texting. Each time a test was taken the number of collisions, speed limit violations, seconds without turn signal, qualitative ranking, brake reaction time, and total time taken was recorded. Once the results were recorded and the averages compared, it was clear that texting and tuning had the most negative effects, while the control caused the least negative effects. To test whether the results of this project would most likely occur with all teenagers, an anova was performed on each data set. Three of the data sets, total time taken, number of seconds without turn signal, and brake reaction time, were not statistically significant. Data sets that were statistically significant, proven by the anova, included number of collisions, number of seconds speeding, and qualitative data. Then, for each of these, t-tests were performed comparing texting to each of the variables. Although the results were scattered and not definitive, tuning appeared to have the most negative effect most often as shown by the t-tests within the data sets that were proven statistically significant. Despite the results, the project proved the point that any distraction behind the wheel is harmful to teenagers.

THE BEST LESSON YOU'VE EVER HAD: COMPARING TEACHING METHODS
Danielle Celeste Barillas
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The intention of this research was to compare the effectiveness of two different teaching methods. The research stage included a fourteen-item survey conducted with one-hundred randomly selected people of various ages. The objective of the survey was to identify the main factors that determined the “best lesson” each respondent had experienced. Results of this research survey were used to test one of four hypotheses. <br><br> Three basic concepts were selected for presentation to two sets of volunteers. The presentation topics ranged from right-brain to left-brain concepts. The concepts were presented to three sets of volunteers using a traditional lecture-style teaching method and then to three other sets of volunteers using a whole-brain teaching method. Evaluations were conducted to quantify the level of volunteer satisfaction after each presentation. Volunteer short-term assimilation and long-term retention of the concepts were evaluated through two simple tests. The first test was administered immediately after the presentation and the second test was administered after approximately twenty-one days. An opinion survey after each presentation was used to ascertain the volunteers’ level of satisfaction with the lesson and the amount of understanding they believed they achieved in the class. <br><br> Data analysis, including the use of the Z-Test, indicated trends and statistically relevant differences in some teaching method comparisons in the four hypotheses. In future projections, a larger sample of people would be used.

ANALYZING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE PROJECTIVE INKBLOT AND MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES CORRELATION
Katlyn Marie Firkus
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of age, ethnicity, and gender on the correlation between a projective inkblot (P.I.) test and the Multiple Intelligences Test (M.I.). The rationale behind this experiment was to aid in the pursuit of creating standards to the projective inkblot tests, eliminating the controversy over their analysis methods. The hypothesis was that an individual’s demographic background would have no significant effect on the correlation between the two tests. The specific aim was to show that there would be no statistical significance among the mentioned demographic variables.<br><br>In order to obtain the M.I. expressions and P.I. responses of each participant, an online survey was created via Quia software, composing the two tests. This survey consisted of a series of “Yes and No” questions regarding the intelligence categories and three projective inkblots accompanied by questions regarding what the participant viewed. <br><br>Once completed, the responses were exported and analyzed for M.I. expression and respective corollaries. These results were divided into demographic groups and the descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. <br><br>The ANOVA and T-tests run on the number of corollaries found in each age group (F=.54, df= 6, p=.778), gender (df= 128, p=.791193), and ethnic group (F=.40, df= 4, p=.806), proved the variances to be insignificant. This, the desired outcome, supports the hypothesis and the belief that the M.I. may hold the key to viable standards for P.I. tests.

THE EFFECTS OF ATTENDING FAITH-BASED MEETINGS ON PERFORMANCE ANXIETY
Jack Everett Rhoades
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron, TX

Many scientists in the past have studied extensively the effects of anxiety on performance. However, there has been much less research on ways to lower the anxiety of the performers. There has been even less research examining spiritual strategies to combat the anxiety felt by the performers.<br><br> This study investigated the effects of attending faith-based meetings on performance anxiety levels. The hypothesis states that attending faith-based events does not affect performance anxiety.<br><br> First, informed consent forms were distributed to all of the potential subjects, explaining how confidentiality would be protected. Next, students who returned the informed consent form from our local Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) chapter and one of our health classes were surveyed about their performance anxiety levels. The study tested three types of anxiety: somatic, concentration disruption, and worry items. These results were documented, and then speakers were invited to speak at the local FCA meetings regarding anxiety in performance and life. After that, two weeks of attendance was recorded at the FCA chapter, and both groups were resurveyed. After recording all of the data, the data were entered into multiple data analyzing programs for analysis.<br><br> There were no significant p-values from the pre-treatment tests to the post-treatment tests to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, if a person attends faith-based meetings, then his or her performance anxiety levels will not be affected. The study could be repeated in the future with a much larger test group to revisit the hypothesis.

THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENT MEDIA ON AGGRESSION LEVELS IN TEENAGE BOYS
Nicolas William Johnston
Sydney Church of England Grammar School, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA

Growing concern about exposure to violent media has not reduced widespread involvement in this form of entertainment. Many studies have been conducted to explore the possible effects, but results have been inconclusive. Some studies have suggested that aggression levels increase after exposure and may result in increases in violent activity. Other studies suggest that playing violent video games is related to aggressive behaviours and physiological stimulation. In contrast, a recent review of the scientific literature suggested that most studies overestimated and overinterpreted the influence of violent video games on aggression.<br><br>This study used a psychological questionnaire to analyse the effects of violent computer games on the aggression levels of a group of teenage boys. Results showed that playing M rated games for three hours did not increase self-reported aggression levels in the group. A follow up study was undertaken to assess the effect of playing M rated games on a range of physiological markers of aggression. In the participant with the greatest increase in self-reported aggression levels, systolic blood pressure increased while watching a humorous television show while diastolic was unchanged. In contrast, during the video game’s “assault” phase, diastolic blood pressure also increased dramatically indicating anger and aggression. No changes were observed in two participants whose self-reported aggression levels were relatively unchanged.<br><br>This study showed that violent video games caused no significant effect on the self-reported aggression levels of a group of teenage boys. However, some players can experience quite large changes in physiological markers of aggression when playing these games and these effects should be considered in future research.

IMPROVING ADHD TREATMENT, YEAR TWO: OBSERVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPUTERIZED COGNITIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS ON CHILDREN WITH ADHD, AND STRUGGLING STUDENTS IN A STRUCTURED SCHOOL SETTING
Kevin Michael Knight
Northwest Florida State College Collegiate High School, Niceville, FL

This experiment is a continuation of a previous study in which a new type of treatment method for ADHD was tested: computerized cognitive training programs. This year, in addition to observing the effectiveness of the program on a group of diagnosed ADD children using both stimulant medication and the program, and the program alone, a group of students from a nearby elementary school that are struggling with their coursework have also been added to the study. The purpose of this experiment is to test a new treatment method for both ADHD, and other cognitive disorders. <br><br> I created three hypotheses: 1) The Lumosity cognitive training programs will continue to be an effective treatment method for children with ADHD. The overall mean improvement (µi) will be greater than zero. 2) Children using the Lumosity programs in addition to stimulant medication will continue to yield the most improvement over those using the programs without medication. The mean improvement of the medication group (µm) will be greater than the mean improvement of the non-medication group (µnm). 3) Students using the Lumosity programs at school will yield greater improvement over the students in the control group. The mean improvement of the student group (µs) will be greater than the mean improvement of the control group (µc).<br><br>In conclusion, the data supports hypotheses 1 and 2, but the lack of a control group at this point in the study makes it impossible to prove my third hypothesis.

THE INFLUENCE OF PHRASE-SPACED TEXT ON READING COMPREHENSION OF STROKE PATIENTS
Lindsey Brooke Saunders
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

Stroke affects more than 700,000 people each year in the United States alone. As a result of a stroke, many survivors need rehabilitation to help regain skills that were lost. One such skill is reading comprehension.<br><br> The purpose of this study was to design a text format that would provide the initial organization needed to comprehend reading material more effectively. This format was tested using adult stroke patients to determine its influence on the comprehension abilities of the group. A typical adult group with no brain injuries was also tested. It was hypothesized that both the stroke and typical adults would score higher on phrase-spaced passages as compared to neutral passages.<br><br> To test this hypothesis, a test group of 20 stroke patients in nursing homes and 20 typical adults with no brain injuries was used. All subjects were required to have a minimum of a high school diploma or its equivalent. Twelve reading passages were chosen from Gates-MacGinitie reading test booklets, levels 5-8. Three passages were chosen from each level. Each passage was reformatted using phrase-spaced text and cascading starting points. The neutral passages would remain in their original format. Each subject silently read a phrase-spaced passage and a neutral passage and answered four questions. This was repeated for a total of six test sessions. <br><br> Test scores were compared using Paired t-Tests and Pearson's Correlation Analysis. Subjects in both test groups had higher comprehension scores after reading passages in the phrase-spaced format. There was a significant interaction, p<0.05, between stroke adults and phrase-spaced formats. The typical adult group did not show significant interaction, p=0.2778. These results reflect the expected hypothesis.

AN ANALYSIS OF LISTENER PERCEPTION AND VISUAL REPLICATION OF SONIFICATIONS: A THIRD YEAR STUDY
Neel Sanjay Patel
Oviedo High School, Oviedo, FL

To address the limitations of human-computer interfaces (HCIs) that rely purely on visual means of information communication, it is necessary to expand information communication to non-visual modalities. This project examines the viability of using sonification, or non-speech audio, and the parameters of pitch, intensity, and tempo, as part of non-visual HCIs by assessing the accuracy of listener comprehension of sonifications.<br><br> Specifically, this study explores the both accuracy with which a listener can visually replicate an auditory pattern and the cognitive context of this audio-to-visual translation. It was hypothesized that an untrained listener presented with a sonification would be able to create a corresponding visual representation with a high degree of accuracy (μ>50%), and that certain characteristics of the visual graph (i.e. the presentation of axes) would affect the nature and accuracy of this replication. A group of 50 subjects spanning demographic categories was given a set of 12 sonifications and asked to create corresponding visual representations. The control group was given only blank space to create the graph on, while the experimental group was given blank space, axes, and grid points, each for 4 trials.<br><br> The results indicate a 76% accuracy rate in users visually replicating an auditory pattern, showing evidence that users can extract and comprehend the patterns in a sonification. The analysis shows slight differences in accuracy levels between the experimental and control groups with significant differences by key demographic factors.<br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported by the data, showing the viability of sonification for information communication.

A CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) AND SLEEP/WAKE DISORDERS
Travis Coleman Sigafoos
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is becoming a widespread epidemic, in which both the diagnosis and understanding of the etiology is quite limited. The relationship between ADHD and sleep/wake disorders is emerging but the results are limited as well. This epidemiological investigation will examine the role of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, sleep/wake disorders, medical history, and social factors in relation with the core ADHD symptoms. The methodology utilizes 9 instruments; (1) Greeting and Consent Form, (2) Identification and Subject Information Form, (3) Simple Medical History Form, (4) NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scale, (5) QoSS Sleep Log, (6) Circadian Rhythm Test, (7) Sleep/Wake Self-Assessment, (8) ADHD Self-Report Scale: Symptom Checklist, and (9) Sleep Deprivation Survey. Through the compilation of the data and extensive analysis, several significant relationships were found. A significant relationship was found between the Sleep Deprivation composite score and the diagnostic score for the ADHD Self-Report Scale: Symptom Checklist (r = 0.5943, 95% confidence interval of 0.4320 to 0.7193; p=3.31E-33 ). Also, a significant relationship was found between ADHD symptoms and sleep/wake disorders (r = 0.5887, 95% confidence interval of 0.4250 to 0.7152; p < 0.0001). This research is very significant because it acts as a comprehensive introductory study in which new factors such as sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm deficiencies, and sleep/wake disorders should be assessed in ADHD diagnostics, along with other significant factors to create an accurate diagnosis.

HOW DO THE VARIABLES AGE, GENDER, AND YEARS OF MUSICAL TRAINING AFFECT PERCEPTION OF MUSICAL INTERVALS?
Samantha Arden Morrison
Classen School of Advanced Studies, Oklahoma City, OK

The purpose of this project was to see if differing age, gender, and years of musical training affected the perception of intervals in the musical scale. After doing a literature review it was found that some pitches and intervals are said to have certain qualities about them regardless of previous conception of those pitches.<br><br> Before experimenting it was thought that a subject would find the minor second, major seventh, and augmented fourth the most unpleasant because they are the smallest and largest intervals and because it spans exactly half of the musical scale. To begin experimentation, the eleven intervals in the musical scale were randomly recorded. A survey was made asking a subjects age, gender, years of musical training, and their response to each interval. Subjects would listen to the recording and rate each interval’s pleasantness (-5 to 5) on the survey. This procedure was repeated 28 times with different subjects.<br><br> After experimentation it was found that the hypothesis was correct, the most unpleasant intervals were the major seventh and minor second. The most pleasant intervals were considered to be the Perfect fourth and Major third; Children under the age of twelve considered everything more pleasantly; Teenagers (age 15-16), especially girls, rated intervals strongly; The people with the most musical training usually rated the intervals more unpleasantly. If this project were to be repeated, it would be important to pay more attention to the noise level surrounding the subject to prevent variation in the subject’s response.

EFFECTS OF THE FULL MOON ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Dominique Helen Tlomak
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

The moon has always been mysterious to people. There has been a persistent myth throughout the years that the full moon affects and alters human behavior, resulting in more aggression and violence. I formulated the hypothesis so that the full moon affects human behavior and it is associated with a significantly larger number of violent deaths including homicides, suicides and accidents on the full moon days in Milwaukee County. Homicidal, Accidental and Suicidal Deaths by Year and Cause Reports from 2001 to 2010 were received from Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The list of phases of the Moon from 2001 to 2010 Central Standard Time was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website. I compared the number of homicides, suicides, and accidents on the full moon days and new moon days. I calculated the mean and standard deviations for the full moon and new moon for homicides, suicides and accidents. I used a two-sample-t-test to show a significant statistical difference. I found a p value of .628 for homicides, a p value of .422 for suicides, and a p value of .333 for accidents. Despite the persistence of the lunar myth throughout time, my study provides no support for such a phenomenon. Since the p values were high, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The results show that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of homicides, suicides and accidents on the full moon days in Milwaukee County between 2001 and 2010.

THE TECHNOLOGIES AS A RESOURCE FOR THE EFFECTIVE LEARNING OF THE ADOLESCENTS AND BEARERS OF ADHD (ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER)
Matheus Manuppella
Colegio Hebraico Brasileiro Renascenca, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Electronic games have potential to develop logical learning, scientific reasoning and the cognitive areas of the brain, as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In my research, I used this claim as a starting point to adopt games as stimulus for the concentration, memorization and self-control of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whose brain dysfunction lies in the previously mentioned prefrontal cortex. Playing games releases neurotransmitters that suffer a higher reuptake in the brains of ADHD patients.<br><br> If such games show potential for bearers of special needs, they could also present potential for the educational methodology of all adolescent students, who belong to Generation Z, immersed in a highly technological environment. <br><br> To achieve my goals, I submitted adolescents with ADHD to concentration, memorization and self-control tests. After these activities, they came into contact with a series of electronic games and remade the tests. So, I was able to analyze how such games stimulate them. I also elaborated a game as an exercise to be incorporated to the teaching method. I aimed showing how these three aspects can be stimulated to obtain better school results. This game works with text interpretation; geography, history and newsreel questions, and it were applied to ADHD bearers and adolescent students.<br><br> With those results, I conclude that electronic games can stimulate several brain functions; therefore, they can be used to develop and improve the performance of people in certain activities, such as learning. Further, this can happen to people with certain neurobiological problems.

PROBLEMATIZING PEDAGOGY AS A NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION STRATEGY: A SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH
Heitor Geraldo da Cruz Santos
Colegio GGE, Recife, Pernambuco, BRASIL

The diseases that kill the most people in the world arise directly from poor eating habits. In addition to this, current nutritional education in schools has a major obstacle, which is the lack of methodologies. My research is a case study on the effectiveness of a nutritional education methodology that problematizes the learning process and considers aspects of social constructivism in the process of eating behavior change. I worked with 78 students, with whom I performed two analyses. In the first group, comprised of 40 teenagers from the 8th and 9th grades, I analyzed the impact of a one-hour lecture in the improvement of students’ eating behavior. In the second analysis, I verified the effectiveness of a more continuous and interdisciplinary work – I developed and applied two didactic sequences, which consist of seven one-hour classes each, with 20 students in 6th grade and 18 in 7th grade. The themes that motivated the discussions in each didactic sequence were: eating habits over time, in the 6th grade, and the influences of food marketing in teenagers’ eating habits, in 7th grade. In both analyses, participants’ eating behavior was evaluated before, and over a period of 6 months after the intervention. Best results were found in the second analysis: the percentage of inappropriate diets decreased from 47.37% to 23.68% and the number of appropriate diets increased from 53.63% to 76.32%. Students' opinions about the methodology were also verified. The collected data demonstrated astonishing impacts resulting from the use of the proposed methodology. To achieve the scientific community, I published pedagogical articles. I believe that the development and dissemination of this innovative methodology provides teachers a feasible and efficient pedagogical strategy.

The purpose of my experiment was to test the Mozart Effect using classic rock, classical, and country music as auditory stimuli. The expected hypothesis was that students would perform better on tests after having studied while listening to music. The project focused on which music genre effected performance the most. Each genre of music was tested against the control for the Mozart Effect. Eight students studied the required material while a certain genre played in the background. During study sessions and tests, the students were observed for unique behaviors and the results were documented. After studying, they were asked questions, including how confident they felt about the forthcoming test and whether or not they liked the music. After responding to these questions, the students were given a written test. Over the course of eight days, each student took four history tests and four science tests. After each test, the students were quizzed on the difficulty of the test and how they felt they performed. The students test results supported the null hypothesis for the tested sample size. The data was analyzed for statistical significance and no significance was found. More test subjects and repeated experiments are needed to find the significance of the effect of each music genre on each student’s testing performance.

WHO PAYS MORE FOR NATIONALLY BRANDED PRODUCTS--EDUCATED OR LESS ENLIGHTENED, OLD OR YOUNG?
Sara Elisabeth Miller
Nicolet High School, Gendale, WI

Have you ever wondered why consumers buy private-label products over nationally branded products? There are many factors that influence consumers’ choices, including perceived product quality, price, and demographics. Depending on the specific product and many demographic factors, consumers are willing to pay varying brand premiums. Brand premiums can be defined as the percentage that consumers are willing to pay for national brands over their private-label equivalent. This study focuses on whether age, education, or other demographic data affects brand premiums that consumers are willing to pay. Using surveymonkey.com, an online survey tool, 123 consumers were asked questions regarding the prices that they were willing to pay for 12 nationally branded products versus their private-label alternatives. The survey contained four sections. First were questions regarding brand premiums. Second were a series of distracter questions such as “do you read the newspaper daily.” Third were questions pertaining to brand loyalty. And last was a section on demographics. Using IBM SPSS Statistics (SPSS), it was determined that both older and more educated consumers were willing to pay lower premiums for nationally branded products compared to their private-label alternatives. This study demonstrates that more knowledgeable consumers (as represented by age, education, and other factors) are willing to pay lower brand premiums than younger, less educated consumers.

THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION STYLE ON LATERAL EYE MOVEMENT WHEN ASKED A KINESTHETIC QUESTION
Elizabeth Marie Hargis
Central Virginia Governor's School, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine if communication style has an effect on lateral eye movement when asked a kinesthetic question. This study was conducted during the fall of 2010 at a local high school. Participants were tested to find communication style using an online assessment. They were then asked a series of four kinesthetic questions; after each question, the initial lateral eye movement was recorded. Using a chi-squared test for independence, the researcher obtained a p-value of 2.06x10-12; since the alpha value was set at 0.05, it was found that communication style has a significant effect on lateral eye movement. The overall hypothesis, that if a person had a digital communication style, then their eyes would move in the directions depicted in an “Eye Accessing Cues” chart, while those with an auditory, visual, or kinesthetic communication style would tend to move towards those respective regions, was not supported. Although the results were found to be statistically significant, they did not follow the predictions in the “Eye Accessing Cues” chart. In conclusion, communication style does have an effect on lateral eye movement, but the eye movement does not follow the predicted patterns.

IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ME: AN INVESTIGATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN POPULAR SONGS
Annelise Cummings
Cleveland High School, Portland, OR

Music is everywhere, and according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2008), music videos and lyrics are a growing part of both children’s and adolescents’ social life and identity. Is there a correlation between lyrics used in popular music and personality?<br><br> Several studies were designed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; Pennebaker, 2001) to analyze lyrical content and its’ correlation to a particular personality construct, narcissism (Twenge, et. al., 2008). The first and second studies sampled 1,500 song titles and 150 song lyrics for the years of 1992-2006. A third study was designed to assess the latest popular media by comparing song lyrics from 2009, 2010, and songs popularized by the musical comedy, Glee.<br><br> These studies imply a relation between music lyrics and self-reported narcissism. Consistent with an exposure model, the changes in negative affect in song titles preceded increases in narcissism. The implications and limitations of these studies are discussed in the context of a dynamic model of personality considering selection and exposure of music.

DESIGNING A GLASS SYSTEM TO CONTROL THE LIGHT INTENSITY AND ROOM TEMPERATURE
Sanad Nidal Abu-Haikal
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Due to the importance of colors in our life, by giving beauty to things and effecting on human’s mood, I was interested to carry out my research in a field that contain using colors in a way to be creative. And before doing any step, I found statistical data in the school’s magazine that included 84 people indicating the effect of colors on their moods. The data were: 1) 67 people answered that colors have a great effect on them, and that they are able to change their moods. 2) While the other 17 people were distributed either they don’t see them as good effecter on their mood, or they don’t care for such things. Moreover, as we all know that some colors have a great effect on the growth of plants such as (Blue and Red).<br><br>In Addition, due to the unstable weather state in our country and even in most of the countries over the world, light intensity and heat inside rooms changes frequently during the day. So, I decided to carry out my research in this field; to control the light intensity in a way that suits students, sick people, business men and plants. Also, my glass system should also provide the user with the color that suits his situation and the plants with color the increase its growth.<br><br>To achieve my above mentioned goals, I’ve did number of experiments on polarizers, shaded glass and colored glass, to study their effect on the light intensity and temperature. The results of the experiments were studied, to come out with a unique design of the glass system. <br><br>My glass system consist of a fixed polarizer and in front of it a rotatable one, which will rotate as a result of being connected to a pulley and a complete electrical system. Between the 2 polarizers, colored sheets will be sliding to the system to apply their effect on it. Moreover, the system was tested, and amazing results were gathered.

PAPER VERSUS SCREEN & MEMORIZATION EFFECTS
Allison Kay Herrera
John B Alexander High School, Laredo, TX

This study tests the correlation between a high school student’s ability to memorize and the medium of the reading material. The mediums are specifically hardcopy and softcopy, the difference between the two being hardcopy is physical, like paper, while softcopy is digital, like a projected image.<br><br> There were 100 subjects invited to participate, but only 62 subjects complied and consented. All the subjects were seniors attending J.B. Alexander High School during the Fall semester of 2010. The students were asked to read 30 random words on paper for 90 seconds, then attempt to recall and write as many as possible afterwards. Afterwards, students were asked to read 30 random words on a projected screen under the same circumstances.<br><br> Overall, the hardcopy reading material had a higher accuracy rate than the softcopy reading material. On average female subjects did better than male subjects, likewise 18 year olds did better than 17 year olds. The accumulation of ideas gained from this study leans towards the concept that hardcopy reading material should be used in lieu of softcopy because there is more to be gained in recall ability.

A STUDY OF THE COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE OF ARITHMETIC COMBINATORIAL PROCESSING USING MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG)
Liza Joely Strauss
Mamaroneck High School, Mamaroneck, NY

Few neurolinguistic studies have investigated our brain’s basic ability to combine simple units to make meaning out of complex constructions. Recent methodological advances in the study of linguistics have been leveraged in the study of arithmetic combinatorial processing. In this work, we have used list and addition calculation tasks to investigate the domain generality or specificity of brain regions of interest. Using Magnetoencephalography (MEG), we have examined areas of the brain that underlie our ability to interpret numerical quantity and perform calculations. Subjects were asked to match single-digit numbers to a corresponding array of dots in the list task and perform simple calculations in the addition task. Results showed that the Interparietal Sulcus is crucial in processing numerical magnitude. While activation in the Ventro-medial Prefrontal Cortex is associated with creating a linguistic phrase, it was inactive when creating an arithmetic composition, suggesting that this area operates differently in different domains. Unexpectedly, Broca’s area was more active in the addition task than in the list task, contradicting widely held theories about this area’s association with memory. Anterior Temporal Lobe activation in the addition task proves that this region plays the same role it does in mathematical processing as it does in language processing.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT MORAL DECISION-MAKING
Katherine Michelle Mangialardi
Ossining High School, Ossining

The decision between right and wrong plays an integral role in human life; and it is crucial to determine how the context of a situation can alter such decisions. The present study attempted to determine the point at which selfish desire overtakes altruism through the variance of circumstantial factors surrounding a moral dilemma. Stimuli were presented via the Psychtoolbox application of Matlab, a technical computing software. Subjects were presented with variations of a simple moral dilemma, in which they were asked to choose whether to “keep” or “turn in” a found wallet. Dilemmas were varied based on social (the wallet’s owner), economic (monetary amount contained in the wallet), and consequential (probability of getting caught for keeping the wallet) factors. Subjects completed 30 distinct trials, each in which subjects’ decisions and reaction times were recorded. Subjects’ decisions were analyzed as functions of probability of getting caught, contained monetary amount, wallet’s owner, and reaction time in multiple arrangements. Data was also segregated by gender. It was determined that overall, female subjects acted more altruistically than males, choosing to turn in the wallet more often (p<0.05). However, when a degree of social connectedness existed between the owner of the wallet and the subject, males opted to turn in the wallet more often than females. As consequence and monetary value were increased, the number of subjects choosing to keep the wallet decreased. Future research may continue to investigate the role of different neural systems for varying circumstances surrounding moral decision-making using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

ACADEMIC DISHONESTY: FACTORS TO A STUDENT'S SUCCESS, YEAR TWO
Krupa Merchant
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

Education is one of the biggest concerns facing America today. It is important that education take place with the utmost academic integrity and academic dishonesty be condemned. The purpose of this research study is first to discover which consequence is most commonly given to students who partake in academic dishonesty. Then, it is to see how effective that consequence is in deterring future acts of academic dishonesty. A 10-question teacher survey and a 23-question student survey were created. The teacher surveys were given to all 80 teachers of Dutchtown High School. In order to recruit subjects for the student survey, a random number table was used to generate 120 random numbers corresponding to a roster of 11th and 12th graders. This random sample was used as subjects for research. Once data was collected, it was disaggregated according to gender and grade level (for students) and according to common answers (for teachers). When teachers were asked to rank consequences according to how often they would give them, 100% of them attested to giving a grade of zero to students who cheat, while 84% of them claimed to give an adminstrative referral. When the students were asked what consequences they believed were most effective in preventing cheating, the majority (49%) answered a grade of zero. It was hypothesized that a grade of zero and/or an adminstrative referral were the two consequences given most often to students. This was accepted, as 100% of the teachers claimed to give a grade of zero and 84% an administrative referral. It was also hypothesized that a grade of zero would be the most effective deterrent to cheating, as it drastically harms a student's GPA. This was also accepted, as 49% of the students stated that it was the most effective deterrent.

CHEMICAL MIND BEND
Ricardo Alejandro Perez
Joseph W. Nixon High School, Laredo, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to view the effects of elevating the levels of various easily-manipulated chemicals on the human mind set and common sense capacity. The overall mission was to advise others on how to easily promote mental sharpness. These chemicals were testosterone, which is released immediately after exercise, endorphins, which are produced by the body ten minutes after exercise, melatonin, which is produced when one is tired or placed in a dark area, serotonin and interleukins, which are produced when one laughs, and dietary sugar. After running a control test, every chemical was individually elevated and a common sense test was administered and scored. This process was followed by the appropriate waiting period to allow the chemical to return to normal levels. The only chemicals which provided a consistently positive effect in comparison to the control group were the endorphins. The other chemicals, melatonin, serotonin and interleukins, testosterone, and sugar, respectively, according to increasing severity, created an inconsistently negative effect on the human mindset. The overall data, however, was extremely varied. In conclusion, no chemical but endorphins had a definitely measurable effect, while the others displayed hazy negative trends.

WOULD YOU DO IT FOR THE KIDS? FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE PREDICTION OF INTERGENERATIONAL PREFERENCES
Sarah Susie Pak
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Individuals must frequently decide whether or not to make sacrifices for the benefit of future generations. Such decisions are referred to as intergenerational dilemmas. For example, when nations enact policies to curb greenhouse gases, they incur large, immediate costs. However, such choices suggest that policymakers believe the short-term costs are worth the long-term benefits. Previous research on intergenerational dilemmas has shown that extended time delay between actions and consequences and reduced affinity to future others cause decision-makers to discount the future more heavily. However, it is unclear how these factors interact to produce intergenerational preference profiles. In this study, participants completed decision-related individual difference measures. The social and intertemporal discounting measures were multiplied to create an interaction term. These measures were entered into a multiple regression model, which showed that all three were significant predictors of intergenerational preferences. The study suggests that impatience and generosity, the theoretical components of intertemporal and social discounting, together account for a unique portion of the variance previously unrecognized by existing intergenerational literature. Future work should explore what other factors can predict intergenerational preferences.

STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND NEURO-TYPICAL INDIVIDUALS TO DETERMINE EMOTION IN FACES
Samantha Michelle Phillips
William A. Shine Great Neck South High School, Great Neck, NY

People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) determine emotions differently than neuro-typical (NT) individuals do. It has been suggested that people with ASD use “rule-based” strategies, meaning they judge the emotion of a face based on a rule they’ve been taught, over “template-based” strategies, meaning they judge the emotion of a face by comparing it to an internal image of what a face with that emotion should look like. Happy and sad faces were placed on a PowerPoint given to 12 ASD and 29 NT subjects. On each slide was a pair of faces; subjects were instructed to “select which face looks the most REALISTICALLY like you would look if you were (ex.) happy” (NT) or to “choose happy” (ASD). The target emotion switched from happy to sad as the faces switched from happy to sad. Faces were designed to show whether subjects favored moderate or exaggerated depictions (to test the use of a rule/template based strategy) and whether they relied more on emotion in the top or bottom half of the face. Subjects with ASD favored exaggerated levels of emotion in the mouth whereas NT’s favored moderate. Subjects with ASD always favored emotion in the mouth over emotion in eyes while NT subjects, for sad faces, favored emotion in eyes. Reliance on faces with the most emotion in the mouth suggests the use of a “rule-based” strategy.

ASSESSING THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF FALSE MEMORIES ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THROUGH DEVELOPING CRIMINALS
Sara Mohamed Samir Mohamed
El Raml Secondary School for Girls, Alexandria, EGYPT

There are three methods that humans apply for remembering; oral, written and multiple choice descriptions. The purpose of this project is to find out which of these three methods may lead to create false memory possibilities. The results could be used to avoid using such method when eyewitnesses are being questioned in courts. Two experiments were carried out; the first involved giving representative sample of volunteers a memory test to estimate the actual performance of their memory. They were then introduced to the above methods to enhance their performance, and then given another memory test to observe how far they have improved. This experiment proved that memory, when not frequently used, became weak through time and the reverse is true, where it gets better gradually, if it is effectively used. The second experiment involved determining which one of the three methods of remembering events lead to increased false memory. This was carried out through dividing the same volunteers into three groups: A, B and C and each group were introduced to four situations, two were watched by them and the other two were read by them. Group A orally described the four situations, Group B described the same situations through writing, and Group C did the same through multiple-choice. The results of the second experiment indicated that group A had the most false memory. It is therefore recommended that questioning eyewitnesses by written or multiple choice methods in court should be considered to avoid false memory possibilities as much as possible.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTICIPATING IN MUSIC LESSONS AND A STUDENT'S ACHIEVEMENT IN MATH
Marianne Virginia Konikoff
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of studying the relationship between playing a musical instrument and students achieving high grades in math is to investigate the suggestion that participating in music positively affects brain development. The hypothesis suggests middle school students participating in music instruction outside the school environment would earn better grades in math courses than their peers who did not participate in music. Middle school students completed a survey regarding participation in music lessons. The school provided each student’s final math grade. Of the 115 middle school students, 18 played an instrument, and their average math grade was 3.94 (sd=0.57) when using the standard four point GPA system. The remaining students averaged 3.39 (sd=0.67). An independent-sample t-test revealed students who played musical instruments earned higher math grades, t(115)=2.6764, p=0.0085. There was no statistically significant gender difference. These statistics led to rejecting the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a positive relationship between playing a musical instrument and students earning high grades in their math classes. This could signify that playing musical instruments positively affects brain development, most likely because when a student plays a musical instrument, almost the entire cerebral cortex is used, resulting in stronger connections between neurons (Weinberger, 1998).

A COMPARISON OF FORGETTING CURVES IN HUMANS AND RATS
Chad Deniz Erturk
Spartanburg Day School, Spartanburg, SC

Behavioral similarities between humans and animals have been a point of research for the experimental psychologist for the last several decades. I investigated the similarities between the forgetting patterns of rats and humans. I trained 8 female Wistar rats in a Skinner Box to respond to a stimulus (light) and measured their forgetting over a 60 second period. Then I used the data to create a curve to show the relationship between retention and time. I later used a well known Forgetting Curve created by Hermann Ebbinghaus to regenerate a human Forgetting Curve to be compared with the rat Forgetting Curve. My results showed that even though significant scale difference in forgetting of humans and rats, the basic principles of forgetting is very similar in these two species.

DAMAGING EFFECTS TO COGNITIVE ABILITY DUE TO LONG-TERM TREATMENT WITH A HIGH FAT/HIGH CHOLESTEROL DIET
Ana Nicole Lanier
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

This study was done as a part of a larger study done to determine whether high cholesterol/high lipid diet leads to altered memory and cholinergic function during aging. Given the fact that nowadays many believe that eating foods high in fat and cholesterol has no effect on brain and memory, I was interested in finding out if feeding rats with a diet high in fat and cholesterol would impair their memory. The null hypothesis was developed in the laboratory and states that if you were to feed young and old rats a high fat high cholesterol diet as compared to their normal diet, you would see no significant difference in their working memory correct errors, their working memory incorrect errors, or their reference memory errors. The hippocampus region of the brain works with inhibition, memory, and space. High fat affects the neurons in this region, and can disrupt ones memory. In this study I observed four different groups of rats; six young/control diet, six young/high fat high cholesterol diet, six aged/control diet, and six aged/HFHC diet were put in a water radial arm maze, and were left alone to find the four platforms located in the arms. It was repeated 4 times a day over 12 days for each rat to record the errors they made. Afterwards I analyzed the data found to determine their learning capacity and memory. At the end of the study it was shown that the aged animals do not learn as well or as quickly, and the animals with a high fat diet do even worse. The null hypothesis is rejected because the analysis of the data shows that there is a significant difference among the four different categories. I helped with the interpretation of this data, which could lead to the experimental design for a future study testing if the effects of the diet could be reversed by treating them with a diet enriched with high amounts of antioxidants.

MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE: EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF MOTIVATION ON LOW STAKE TEST SCORES
Jacob Johnson
Salem Hills High, Salem, UT

Tests are routinely designed to estimate what people have learned or their potential to learn. However, although many tests are excellent in differentiating performance, they run the risk of being somewhat inaccurate. Why? Because the tests do not consider test taker motivation.<br><br> <br><br>This research looks at the effect of motivation on the low-stakes test scores of 232 high school students between ages 15 and 18. Respondents were randomly assigned to the control group or motivated conditions. The motivator in this case was a $25 iTunes gift certificate. Students in the control group were told “this is a test for research, please do your best, thanks for participating,” while the motivated group was told “if you score over 80% on this test you will be entered into a drawing for a $25 iTunes gift certificate.” <br><br>There was a statistically significant relationship between external motivation and test performance. A 2-sample t-test showed that respondents will do better on a task if they are offered a simple reason to do so (P <0.05). An F test showed that test takers who evaluated themselves as intrinsically motivated performed significantly better (P < 0.01) than those who did not.<br><br>This research highlights the critical link between what motivates a person and how they perform. Simple motivators can be an effective performance enhancer. This information has important implications in parenting, educating, and even hiring. The next step is to understand intrinsic motivation and if it is possible to develop it.

PHONICS VS. WHOLE WORDS: THE EFFECTS OF REARRANGING THE LETTERS IN A WORD
Mary Alyssa Flemming
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The brain relies on the occipital cortex and the frontal lobe to allow a person to read and comprehend language. This study investigated how the brain reacts when reading rearranged letters in a word and too see if Phonics or Whole Word Language was preferred. It was hypothesized that the Minors from the study would read using Phonics and the Adults using Whole Word. The approach used was to take a piece of text and rearrange the letters of every word. The rearranged text was given to a group of minors and adults to read aloud. Results were recorded based on whether the word was sounded out or said in a whole portion. Fluency and accuracy were also tested. The results showed that Minors used Phonics to decipher the rearranged words, yet overall Whole Words was the dominant choice. The use of Phonics caused a greater number of mistakes when reading the rearranged text compared to Whole Word. In society, this research would prove useful to people and corporations involved with the education and marketing of products and materials towards certain age groups.

REGULATION OF LIFE SPAN EXTENSION AND VARIED MUSCLE BEHAVIOR FROM THE INTAKE OF 2-PROPYLPENTANOIC ACID THROUGH THE DIETARY CONTROL OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Eugene Kim
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

In recent years, gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission and Dopamine (DA) release have been labeled as the key factors in disorders exhibiting mood instability or seizures. Valproic acid (VPA) is currently the most popular anticonvulsant worldwide although there is a vast range of directed side effects. Caenorhabditis elegans allowed for the direct analysis of testing the causes of these side effects. <br><br> Muscular locomotion and life span were measured under the influence of VPA. It was hypothesized that a significant difference in movement between the control (C) and experimental (E) groups and between the two E groups would result. The E groups varied by the amount of VPA they consumed. In the second experiment, it was hypothesized that the test groups would have significantly different life spans. <br><br> It was found that there was no significant difference between the E groups; however, between the C and E groups there was a significant difference in most of the variables regarding locomotion. Regarding life span, the C group had a significantly shorter life span than the E group. Through qualitative data, paralysis of the tail and excessive normal behavior were depicted. Through this research, it was concluded that a mutation had occurred that suggests hypersensitivity to inhibitors causing paralysis in C. elegans. Also, VPA was shown not to harm an essential agent in an organism, as life span was extended. In the future, it would be most productive to study a combination of the tail mutation and how extended life span is shown through locomotion.

SOUND OF MATHNESS: ENCORE
Megan Marjorie Minatra
Waverly South Shore High School, Waverly, SD

The purpose of my project was to see if music will have any effect on hearing impaired participants while they complete math tests. I compared the test scores and the time it took for the participants to complete each test.<br><br> My hypothesis is the participants will not do as well on the tests when there is music playing. I believe this because they do not listen to music on regular basis, and it will be distracting to have it playing in the background. In contrast, I believe that the classical music will have the next highest grades on tests and will log a shorter time period for the testing.<br><br> I looked for music genres with similar beats per minute. After I found some songs, I analyzed the music with a microphone connected to a Vernier Labpro program to better compare song quality. I compared similarities of the songs and then chose three that possessed similar qualities for each genre. Next I asked for volunteers at the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf. I received their consent forms; I traveled to Minnesota to start experimenting.<br><br> The participants filled out a survey prior to and after the tests. The testing was completed in a neutral classroom at the academy and the tests were timed and recorded. My hypothesis was not supported. The participants’ scores and times averaged better when there was classical music playing. After that it was hip-hop, no music, and lastly country which were ranked second, third, and fourth respectively.

MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE BP OIL SPILL AND HURRICANE KATRINA ON MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST YOUTH
Pooja Goel
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

Objective: To determine the psychological effects of the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi Gulf Coast high school students. Method: After creating an online survey and receiving permission from the heads of the two public high schools to conduct the survey on their students, a web link to the electronic survey was sent to students in order to access the survey. After receiving all the responses, the data was exported onto an Excel Worksheet and mined by a math professor and I. In order to interpret the data and test the hypotheses, I used the x2 method (Chi – squared) and probability. Results: Stress level essentially did not differ between females and males for both the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, for the most part, there was no difference in stress levels between seniors and juniors during the two events. Furthermore, seniors did not experience more stress than sophomores during the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina. Lastly, for the most part, juniors did not experience more or less stress than sophomores during the two events. For the most part, there was no difference in stress levels between African–Americans and European –Americans for both the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, for the most part, there was no difference in stress levels between African–Americans and Hispanic –Americans for the two events. Lastly, there was no difference in stress levels between European–Americans and Hispanic–Americans for both the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina. Conclusion: This study can help develop prevention efforts for the harmful psychological results that future disasters may bring and therefore lower the risks of long term mental damage.

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF EMOTIONAL STIMULUS ON STUDENT MEMORY AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE?
Tessa Ray Carver
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

The purpose of this study was to determine if students would better retain information learned when instruction was presented by an instructor demonstrating dynamic emotion. Second, was to better understand how a student’s self-reported mood might influence learning. <br><br>Participants were assigned a video lesson presented by a teacher who demonstrated dynamic emotion while teaching. The control classes viewed the same video lesson presented by the same teacher, but the teacher demonstrated no emotion. The same test was administered four times over a period of 12 weeks to determine content retention. Further, all students were asked to self-report on their own mood at the time of the initial test. Finally, students were shown a slide presentation with learning content that had pictures and music designed to influence mood. The control group viewed only the slide-show with content learned minus emotional stimulus. <br><br>Scores for the control group decreased 0.50 of a point over a twelve week period, while research group’s average scores increased 0.23 over the same period. Students reporting an indifferent mood on initial test date scored 0.20 higher than those reporting a positive mood, and 0.70 higher than those reporting a negative mood. The slide-show inquiry revealed students watching the no-emotion slide-show scored an average of 4.3 out of 6. <br><br>The trend in both studies supports the hypothesis that teacher's mood influences learning but if the mood does not match the content it may be distracting. Further, while less conclusive, it appears that students’ presenting mood may impact test scores.

THE EFFECT OF THEATRE ARTS PARTICIPATION ON ACADEMIC SUCCESS
Arianne Christine Melton
Gresham Union High School, Gresham, OR

The idea of this experiment was to study the trends and correlations between students who participate in a theatre arts class at school and their academic grades, hypothesizing that drama students always have better grades. When schools everywhere are attempting to find areas to cut most are resorting to arts because they are viewed as nonessential to academic learning. The purpose of this study comes in to try and show that arts are a reinforcement of academics. Collecting data was done by comparing grades of these drama students to grades of a control group of non-drama students, to see if the reinforcement can be proven statistically. In doing this a survey collecting core class grade data of high school students in both groups was designed, and GPAs of those surveyed classes were also collected. The data was analyzed in a series of bar graphs comparing year level, grade averages, and test group for both the survey data and GPA data. T-tests comparing the averages were also performed to support that there were no statistical differences at specific moments in time between those groups. But, when later looking at trend over time graphs of the average survey data and GPA data, over time drama students were shown to have more improvement in their core classes the longer they participated from 9th to 12th grade. Their counterpart did not improve as significantly. Therefore, the idea that drama students have better grades than their counterpart isn’t true, but the class helps them improve.

AUDIO-VISUAL HIV/AIDS EDUCATION IN A TANZANIAN ADOLESCENT POPULATION
Lori Kim
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

This study explores the effectiveness of different HIV/AIDS educational programs among Tanzania youth in two different high schools. The effectiveness of various methods of AIDS education programs, including audio-visual aid, group discussion, and peer education will be examined. This study also explores the impacts of HIV/AIDS education programs on adolescents’ changes in attitude toward willingness to get tested for HIV.<br><br> Two hundred sixteen teens, aged 18 to 23, participated in this program to determine their knowledge of HIV/AIDS, attitudes toward being tested for HIV/AIDS, and the effectiveness of different methods of HIV/AIDS educational programs. It is hypothesized that the students who are taught about HIV/AIDS using an audio-visual aid will retain more information and be more willing to volunteer to get tested than the students who are only taught through lecture style methods.<br><br> The results of the pre-education surveys indicate that Tanzanian youth demonstrated an adequate amount of knowledge on the subject of HIV/AIDS prior to participating in the study. However, the results still indicate that all the educational methods used to teach the students about HIV/AIDS proved to be beneficial. Post-activity surveys showed dramatic improvement in understanding. The number of students who were willing to volunteer to get tested for HIV/AIDS after being educated about HIV/AIDS using the audio-visual showed a statistically significant increase. As a result, audio/visual methods of teaching about HIV/AIDS do indeed persuade students to get tested. However, further research is needed to better evaluate the long-term effects of the audio-visual method for HIV/AIDS education.

IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY: EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ON HYPERTENSION
Sarah Averi Albala
John Jay High School, Cross River, NY

Vascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Hypertension is considered the most important risk factors for vascular disease. Despite a large range of medical treatments, 50% of those with hypertension still have uncontrolled blood pressure. Disparities among different race-ethnic groups exist within vascular disease. Social resources such as social networks may be important to understanding mechanisms behind disparities in vascular disease. Indeed, due to the current economic downslide of the past 10 years there has been a shift in living arrangements as graduates, unable to get jobs, must move back with their parents, and the elderly back with their children, shifting the western living model. Little work has been done to examine living arrangements and vascular health. <br><br>Using preliminary results from community interviews, living arrangements were identified as related to health. Afterwards a large multi-ethnic urban community of 3,298 people was selected in order answer the following questions: 1)What is the relationship between living arrangements and race-ethnicity, 2) what impact does living arrangements have on vascular health, and 3) do external networks mediate the impact of living arrangements on health outcomes. After recoding social network variables, Hispanics were found to be significantly more likely to live in multigenerational households than whites and blacks (p < 0.001). Livings in multigenerational or nuclear units were found to be significantly protective against systolic blood pressure >140, further living in multigenerational families is associated with significantly better control of hypertension. These results suggest that hypertension can be successfully controlled through novel and sustainable family interventions.

MARSHMALLOW MORALITY: A CASE STUDY OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE AND DELAY OF GRATIFICATION IN CHILDREN AGES 5 TO 9 YEARS OLD
Clara Jordan Chalk
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to conduct a case study in order to study the development of a child’s conscience through a distributive justice and a delay of gratification test. Based off of Kohlberg's theory of moral development, it is predicted that Kindergarten students will fall into a 0-B or 1-A level. The seven-year-old students should display a higher level of about 1-B. By the fourth grade, they should be able to recognize special circumstances, level 2-A or 2-B. In the distributive justice test, one scenario was presented which contained four characters. 15 pairs of solutions were presented and the student was asked to pick the “most fair” ending to the story (ex. Dylan gets more money because he is poor vs. Carrie is the tallest so she gets the most money). Each solution represents a stage in moral development and a number is placed on the back of each solution to quantify the data. In the delay of gratification test, students were placed in a room with a marshmallow for 10 minutes. They had to choose to either deny the marshmallow and receive a second one after the 10 minutes or eat the one marshmallow. The mean scores of the justice test were 2.3, 2.8, and 3.4, respectively. The number of failures in the marshmallow task decreases as age increases. The second and fourth grade students are right on track with Kohlberg's theory. The hypothesis was rejected and a continuation using a large sample size will hopefully contribute to the Nature versus Nurture debate.

THE CONSTITUTIONALITY INDEX: A JUDICIARY AND MACROECONOMIC GUIDANCE FOR INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS WHEN INVESTING IN NATIONAL ECONOMIES
Ana Sofia Cardoso Monteiro
Colegio Marista Sao Luis, Recife, PE, BRASIL

Since 1990, after the creation of the HDI (Human Development Index), development does not exclusively concern economic growth. In the past years, greater complexity brought by globalization has expanded overall global priorities, by establishing Western systems as references from a liberal economic and political perspective.<br><br>In this model, Eastern cultures are stereotypically seen as intervening, which doesn’t able them to effectively participate in global transactions.<br><br> The contradiction between globalization and nationality has never been this much discussed as it is today, according to a document published by the United Nations - UN in 2007. Instead of equaling wealth distribution, this phenomenon has contributed to an even greater imbalance between developed and developing countries, since interfering in national business structure also destroys its economic and government identity.<br><br> Based on these facts, I present the Constitutionality Index – CI, a social evaluation index that co-relates macroeconomic and judiciary aspects in order to offer a neutral and trustful guidance for international entrepreneurs.<br><br> The CI is based on the methodological study of existing indexes, such as HDI, EDB, Index of Gini and ED. <br><br> This study shows that evaluating how rules are followed in a society, one attracts concomitantly not only companies by national economic opening, but also one translates its stability to the global community and gives it the opportunity to show that it is able to receive investments and improve its infrastructure and quality of life.

THE 21ST CENTURY TEETHER: A NEW TEETHER THAT PREVENTS CAVITY IN INFANTS
Ghufran Essam Masoud
Al Bayan High School, Jeddah

Statistics and data have indicated that tooth decay is one of the most common diseases in Saudi Arabia. Around 90% of the population including all ages suffers from that ailment. Many dentists and other specialists participated in my survey have stressed the ultimate importance of the healthy teeth for the children. They have emphasized the physiological and negative influences of the tooth decay and other mal-symptoms of both the teeth and mouth. In the light of my findings and the opinions of the experts, I have come up with my thesis. It states that, “Brushing the teeth at an early age, protects against the possible diseases that largely afflict them at later ages”. <br><br>I have used a number of means including the internet, related books, essays, interviews and surveys to do my study. Upon the completion of the required data, I have realized the significance of developing a handy tool that facilitates brushing the teeth of the children at an early age. The proposed tool is free from any fluoride. The reason is the use of this material by young children is extremely harmful and results in many problems including white spots on the teeth. In addition, fluoride causes stomachache as it is heavy on the stomach and kidney of the child. <br><br>Accordingly, I have created my new item that will help overcoming all the related side effects and effectively fit the purpose. My device is a circular-shape sucker and its external upper and lower sides are hollow. In this empty or hollowed area, there are plastic lines similar to those found in the normal toothbrushes used by the old. I have chosen this shape as it is comfortable for the gum especially at the times of forming the teeth. It is also effective in cleaning the gum and removing the bacteria and other accumulated undesirable items. Furthermore, the child may use the new sucker anytime and everywhere, as it is portable, light as well as handy.

GOOPLAY! THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEO GAME IN IMPROVING WEB-SEARCHING SKILLS FOR CHILDREN
Bayan Mohammed Mashat
Dar Altarbia, Jeddah, Central, SAUDI ARABIA

Search engines are effective tools to find information very quickly. However, beginners or unprofessional users follow bad searching habits while using them. Thus, this research project aims to design an educational video game and test its effectiveness in developing effective web-searching behaviors while using the search engine for children (age10-12). The researcher tests three hypotheses: (1)assumes that the educational video game "GOOPLAY" will develop web-searching skills for children, (2)assumes playing "GOOPLAY" will develop web-searching skills better than the traditional teaching method, and(3) assumes that using the "GOOPLAY" with the traditional teaching method will be better than using the game alone. Three groups have been sampled from a local school to test the hypotheses with pre and post tests: control group used traditional teaching method, experimental group (1) used the "GOOPLAY" game, and experimental group (2) used the traditional teaching method with the "GOOPLAY" game. After the experimentation, T-Tests have been performed at significance level of 95% to compare the means of pre and post tests. Results indicate that the educational video game not only improved web-searching skills (T=-7.862, P<0.05), but also was a better method of learning web-searching skills than by teaching with the traditional method (T=2.451, P<0.05). Also, using the game with the traditional teaching method did not reveal to be more effective than using the game only (T=0.616, P>0.05). The game creates fun way of learning web-searching skills and it can be a creative tool to replace the “Help Page” in search engines.

Ayedh Monef Alshammary
Al Timyat School, Rafha, Northern, SAUDI ARABIA

Mobile phone use in the past ten years has expanded dramatically, making many of the scientists and researchers asking questions about the impact of mobile use on human health. People are still not sure of the impact of mobile phone and they are not aware of the danger of mobile phone on human health. This research seeks to verify the impact of mobile on human health and the understanding by people. In this research referencing the measurement of the level of radiation for a large number of mobile phones and the experiment was conducted on a model of the human ear. Three doctors were interviewed regarding the assessment that mobile phones cause diseases of the ear, specifically in the flame of the auditory nerve. The main research included a questionnaire to 1000 people and concluded that using mobile for more than 30 minutes a day increases the probability of infection auditory nerve 3 times. Also, it appeared that two thirds of people do not realize the danger of mobile phone and 23% of people are using mobile for more than half an hour a day, which proved this research that Mobile affecting human health. It can be conjectured that most people do not realize the danger of mobile phone.

MOSQUITOES BE GONE!
Ruchi Jayesh Shah
Sachem High School North, Lake Ronkonkoma, NY

Global deaths resulting from mosquito transmitted diseases are on the rise, yet commercial repellants are expensive, harmful to the human body, and often lead to mosquito resistance. Thus, in an effort to improve mosquito control mechanisms, an all-natural mosquito repellant was created with ingredients including lime and Azadirachta indica, an indigenous Asian plant. The goal was to create a dual effect repellant that would both neutralize attractive components and mask the scent of human perspiration. Human sweat samples were collected on cotton balls through voluntary consent of participants and the samples were initially tested with the mosquito species Culex pipiens in a custom-built and designed mosquito chamber. Then, the repellant was sprayed on the most attractive sample and the experiment was repeated. Data indicates that the repellant was so effective that the mosquitoes would not approach the entire side of the tank in which the samples were placed. The experiment was repeated numerous times with samples from both genders, and the mosquitoes were extremely repelled from the once attractive samples after the repellant was sprayed on them as shown by a p-value of .008. Further testing will be done on a larger sample population and ultimately the repellant will be tested for efficacy versus commercial chemical based repellants. The dual-effect repellant that was created is effective and cheaper, rendering it more accessible to developing nations. These finding arouse both commercial and humanitarian potential as the repellant would be able to prevent millions of deaths worldwide.

DO DIFFERENT SIZE OF FONTS AFFECT READING RATE?
Daniela Galindo
Shattuck High School, Shattuck, OK

The purpose of this project is to test reading rate with four <br><br>different font sizes. After doing research, I decided to perform a test to determine whether different size of fonts affected reading speed. Font size 12 was used as the controlled variable because it is the most frequently used font size. Font sizes 8, 18, 20 were also used. The students read 80 word paragraphs taken from the 9th grade Physical Science book. Reading times for each font size were compared with a student-t test. The student-t test showed there was not a significant difference with any font sizes at a 95% confidence level. Font size 20 was read the best. The font size 8 was preferred the most by the readers, while font size 28 was the least preferred.

GROWING UP 'IN SYNC': CONNECTING A BRIDGE TO AN AUTISTIC MIND'S WORLD
Adelina Corina Cozma
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, Ontario, CANADA

This study investigates the benefits of using a world-class real-time and file-based digital video system to screen for auditory-visual integration deficits by determining the temporal integration windows of bimodal speech perception in autistic and typically developing children, and to improve speech intelligibility and prosodic processing through audio-video noise reduction in two dimensional (2D) and stereoscopic three dimensional (S3D) display environments. Eleven high-functioning autistic children and eleven age-matched controls completed auditory-visual integration tasks incorporated in two innovatively developed software programs presented in 2D and S3D, testing: 1) onset synchrony/asynchrony detection of conversational speech associated with signal lead recognition and 2) speech intelligibility and prosodic processing of unimodal and bimodal emotional and non-emotional stimuli at low-, mid- and high-frequencies. Accuracy and response times were compared, revealing that autistic children, characterized by wider temporal integration windows, did not integrate stimuli as effectively as controls. Everyone improved bimodal speech perception in S3D. Speech intelligibility and prosodic processing decreased for stimuli presented with noise, especially at low-frequencies. For stimuli without noise at mid-frequencies, all subjects, especially the autistic, exhibited enhanced performances in S3D, for bimodal rather than unimodal inputs, and recognized approach-related emotions more quickly and accurately than withdrawal-related emotions. By personalizing and streaming content in medical, educational and personal environments, the latest digital video technology can improve the lives of typically developing individuals and those with autism and other learning disabilities.

EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS ON ADHD PATIENTS WITH DOPAMINE SUSCEPTIBILITY POLYMORPHIMS AND METHYLPHENIDATE DOSES REGULATION BASED ON MOLECULAR ANALYSIS
Sebastian Patino Valenzuela
Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, Jalisco, MEXICO

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the current diagnostic for children presenting symptoms of innatention, hyperactivity-impulsivity and a combination of both (Barkley 2006), which has a pooled prevalence of 5.29% in global population (Aguiar et al. 2010). This study present preliminary evidence of association between executive functions of ADHD patients, methylphenidate doses regulation and molecular data from dopamine genes DAT1, DRD4 and DRD5. It was hypothesized that "there is a high correspondence percentage between ADHD and dopamine susceptibility polymorphisms", and "by making an adequately diagnosis and establishing a specific dose of methylphenidate, there is an improvement on executive functions of ADHD patients." The research included 32 ADHD Mexican patients between 4 to 17 years that were recruited from UMAE Hospital to determine the correspondence percentage between ADHD and dopamine susceptibility polymorphisms and the relation between patients who predicted or not an adequately response to methylphenidate. The relation between susceptiblitity polymorphisms and ADHD subtypes was determined for 23 patients. So far executive functions (working memory, planning and verbal fluency)were evaluated for 6 patients. The correspondence between ADHD and dopamine polymorphisms was 93.75%. The 96.77% reduced their symptoms included on DSM-IV criteria. The association of inattention subtype with DRD5 was 100%, to hyperactive-impulsive with DAT1 was 70% and to combined with DRD4 was 100%. Patients under the specific medication got an average score in working memory an planning. The major deficit was on verbal fluency. There is a strong genetic component related to ADHD, and patients with specific medication had a minor tendency to present problems in executive functioning.

Since musical initiation schools in the Metropolitan Zone of Guadalajara continue using traditional methodologies that are not focused in developing the musical hearing, learners cannot improve its musical hearing. The musical hearing is defined as the ability to identify, classify, and reproduce tuned sounds that allow the development of the musicality, which means, the ability to thrill the audience beyond the score. The musical hearing is an innate quality, and musicians are who seek improve it. A method applied twice a week that consists in twenty-four sessions of forty minutes each one has been designed in order to achieve the musical hearing. The stimulus in each session was listening music from the Microtonal System ―proposed by the Mexican composer Julián Carrillo― and music from the Twelve-Tone Equal-Tempered System. According to the progress of sessions, the twenty minutes assigned for listen music from the Twelve-Tone Equal-Tempered System and Microtonal System varies because increased the time for listening music from de Microtonal System. Children learned to differentiate the tonal micro-intervals, so it was easier for them to differentiate twelve sounds that are in the Twelve-Tone Equal-Tempered System. The form of assessment sessions was a rhythmic and melodic dictate that was designed according major and minor musical scales. The difficulty level of each dictate increased as sessions were attended, and learners were capable of attending melodic dictates easily. The sample conformed by 53 children between 8 and 12 years supported that the Microtonal music stimulus causes them to develop their musical hearing in a 62.4%.

THE EFFECT OF EAR DOMINANCE ON OBJECT LOCALIZATION AFTER AUDIO-VISUAL CONDITIONING
Nadege Giraudet
Institute for Collaborative Education, New York, NY

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate aspects of the relationship between ear dominance and visual perception. <br><br>Research suggests that audio and visual stimuli are processed similarly by the brain when it comes to space perception. To what degree the brain depends on hearing for space perception has not been established and little investigated. This experiment attempts to draw connections between audition and space perception by focusing on the specific link between the lateralization of hearing and object localization (a subject’s ability to locate shapes on a computer screen) after conditioning.<br><br>Building on recent research on ear dominance, and the effects of handedness and family traits, this experiment tested how these variables and others changed a subject’s ability to visually localize shapes. <br><br>Fifty volunteers (ages 10 to 59) were first exposed to a conditioning video designed to make them associate a triangle and a square with distinct audio tones. Two equal groups were then formed and exposed to a video with (for the control group) or without (for the variable group) an audio component. Subjects were evaluated on their ability to successfully situate the triangle.<br><br>Though the data doesn’t establish conclusively the nature of the links between ear dominance and object localization, the study builds a foundation for future research, uncovering questions surrounding lateralization. Data analysis points to handedness and gender differences and to the possible presence of a group of super-localizers in the population. Language or musical experience may not influence a person’s performance in the test.

A BIG FAT DEAL, PHASE II: FAT TALK, BODY SATISFACTION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF MEDIA IMAGES
L. Elisabeth Burton
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

Fat talk (Nichter, 2001) includes negatively talking about dieting, weight, and body image. Fat talk is a relatively new concept in literature. I was unable to find any published studies that explore the relationships between perceptions of media images, fat talk, and body satisfaction.<br><br> My hypothesis was: girls who perceive media images as attainable and “real” are more likely to engage in fat talk and have lower body satisfaction. <br><br> I developed and distributed a survey to 47 girls ranging in age from 13 to 18. The data was analyzed using Pearson Correlations.<br><br> The results supported my hypothesis with a strong positive correlation between media perceptions and fat talk, meaning that the more strongly girls agree with statements such as: “these pictures reflect the ideal image for females” the more frequently they engage in fat talk. I got a negative correlation between media perceptions and body satisfaction, meaning that the more strongly girls agree with statements such as: “these pictures reflect the ideal image for females” the more dissatisfied they were with their bodies. <br><br> Increased frequency of fat talk and lower body satisfaction may negatively influence body image. Because low body image has been associated with low self-confidence and self-efficacy these findings may have important implications. <br><br> When girls are preoccupied with their physical selves, they often fail to understand that they are far more than how they look. If girls continue to use the media’s “perfect woman” as their standard, they will remain disempowered.

W, WH, WHY CAN'T I HAVE THE JOB? LISTENERS' PERCEPTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO SUFFER SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS
Rosalyn Jules Langhinrichsen-Rohling
S. S. Murphy High School, Mobile, AL

The purpose of this project was to measure people’s perceptions of individuals with various types of speech impediments. It was hypothesized that the reader with a lisp, the reader who stuttered, and the reader with an R-distortion would be rated as less intelligent, less desirable to hire, and more neurotic than the reader without a speech impediment. This hypothesis was generated from previous research that had shown that adolescents, college students, and professors rated speech-impaired people more negatively than people with normal speech. Little previous research has considered people’s perceptions of individuals with an R-distortion.<br><br>This experiment measured people’s perceptions of speech-impaired people using the Big Five Personality Factors, the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, and descriptor ratings constructed by Forbes et al. (2002). Each group of subjects listened to one version of a recording of the Grandfather’s passage. There were four versions in all (i.e., lisp, stutter, R-distortion, and normal). They then filled out the survey packet about the recording they heard.<br><br>The obtained results revealed that people with any type of speech impediment are perceived as less intelligent and less desirable to hire, but they are not rated as significantly more neurotic than the people without a speech impediment. However, the speech-impaired people were rated as significantly less agreeable and significantly more feminine than the person speaking without a speech impediment was rated. Contrary to prediction, there were no significant differences in perceptions among the three different types of speech impediments included in the study.

EPIGENETIC FACTORS INFLUENCE DROSOPHILA BRAIN FUNCTION AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR, PHASE V
Andrew Wooyoung Kim
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

Aggression is the disposition in which an individual becomes actively engaged in the pursuit of a goal. In nature, organisms exhibit aggression for multiple reasons: food and territory, protection, and mate choice, all essential for survival. Genes that activate human aggression, (MAO-A, termed the “warrior” gene) are being used to treat patients of psychiatric diseases characterized by aggression, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, or a lack thereof, such as MDD. Currently, little is known about the neural, genetic, and environmental mechanisms that underlie aggression. Previous data shows that cyp6a20 is overexpressed in aggressive strains (+/+). The purpose of my project is to determine the epigenetic effects of social experience on synaptic protein expression and aggression in transgenic flies (cyp6a20 -/-). I hypothesize that social experience influences aggression as well as gene expression in the brain. <br><br><br><br>A P-element was inserted to overexpress cyp6a20. Social experience was limited through isolation at the egg, larva, and adult stage. Adult flies were observed for aggression, and dissected for brain observation and Western blot analysis.<br><br><br><br>My data shows that social experience significantly affects aggression and protein expression. More experienced flies have larger mushroom bodies and higher expression of Bruchpilot protein, but do not overexpress aggression. Therefore, posttranscriptional products, such as Bruchpilot and neurotransmitters, can be used as potential indicators of gene expression for aggression in homologous human genes. Moreover, the suppressive effects of social experience on aggression show promising pharmacological advancements in antidepressants, which affect behavior through neurotransmitters and MAOA-inhibitor interactions.

THE EFFECT OF AUDIBLE STIMULATION ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND BETA BRAIN ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL LOBE
Savanna Lynne Melkus
Mesa High School, Mesa, AZ

The influence of auditory stimulation on brain arousal, as measured by beta EEG activity from the frontal lobe, and cognitive ability, as measured by a memory retention task, was examined. Analyzing whether auditory stimulation, such as music, can influence cognitive ability, this study was assembled to test whether music beats or the stimulation by an auditory condition would exhibit optimal arousal for accelerated performance. There were four groups of audible variables: a full symphony orchestral piece of "Moldau" by Bedrich Smetana at 66 beats per minute, a pedal harp solo composition of "Moldau" performed by Xavier De Maistre at 66 beats per minute, metronome beats at 66 beats per minute, and silent background noise. Each group had ten participants, adding up to forty subjects total. It was hypothesized that solo music would have the most favorable amount of both stimulation and beats, creating a complimentary, conducive study condition. The results did not reveal statistical significance and, therefore, could not fully support the stated hypothesis.

HOW DO YOU THINK?: A STUDY IN LINGUISTICS AND COGNITION USING SPATIAL-TIME METAPHORS AND CHINESE SPEAKERS
Katelyn Elizabeth Orr, Jessica Tew, 
Kahuku High School, Kahuku, HI

We set out to study linguistic differences and their influence on cognition. According the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, language creates culture and shapes thought. Therefore there should be linguistic connections to how different cultures think which difference can be tested through specific grammatical devices. We hypothesized that if Chinese and English students are tested on spatial-time perception, as suggested by Lera Boroditsky's studies, then they will respond differently according to the language they speak; Chinese speakers will correctly answer vertical questions, English speakers will correctly answer horizontal questions. <br><br>To test this we gave 75 native English and native Mandarin speakers 30 question true or false tests, which included 7 spatial-time metaphors. Of these, three were visual questions (ex.A square is shown to the left of a circle with the true statement: the square is before the circle) and four hypothetical questions (Ex. April is before May). We analyzed test scores using the Two Variable T-test. From this we discovered that there was a significant difference between Chinese and English perceptions of visual metaphors, but no noticeable difference in the two groups comprehension of hypothetical metaphors. <br><br>When applied, this knowledge could have a major effect on communication from international relations to inter-cultural marriage. If the basic set-up of language does indeed change the way cultures think, as this study suggests, then cross-lingual communication needs to be adapted accordingly. Realizing the inherent connection between language and cognition is vital to successful global unity.

Science Un-Fair?: A Reformative Analysis of Parental Factors and Research Misconduct <br><br>This project focused on whether certain students have an unfair advantage in science fair competitions over others due to parental factors. The project also looked into whether there was serious research misconduct in the science fair research community.<br><br>The hypothesis was formed that students who had one or more parents with graduate degrees or higher would reach significantly higher levels in science fair competitions than students with no parents with graduate degrees. It was hypothesized that students who worked in a scientific research laboratory for their project would reach higher levels than students who did not work in a lab. Also hypothesized was that there would be evidence of serious misconduct in students' research work.<br><br>An anonymous survey was given at random to 100 science-fair-competing students at a certain scientific magnet high school. Included in the survey were questions about research misconduct, parental education, and lab use. Many two proportion z-tests were run, and it was found that students who had laboratory access did significantly better in regional, state, and ISEF competitions. It was found that students who had parents with high education reached significantly further levels of competition. More strikingly, it can be said with 98% confidence that at least 60% of the entire population of MST researchers has committed acts of scientific misconduct. <br><br>All of the original hypotheses were supported by the research, some at the .05 level and some at the .15 level (p-values). Reformative actions must be taken at the school that was researched and at other schools/fairs throughout the country to minimize such unfair advantages and blatant misconduct.

EDUCATIONAL ROBOTICS: AN INNOVATION THAT QUALIFIES LEARNING IN PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS
Wanderson Magalhaes da Costa, William Braga de Souza, 
Colegio Estadual de Maracanau, Maracanau, Ceara, BRASIL

The use of educational robotics as a teaching tool allows students to develop the ability to question, think and find solutions. Our goal is to carry the student to develop hypothesis, to investigate, establish relationships and to draw conclusions, leaving the theory to start the concrete. In the development of our research, we executed six workshops, divided in three stages: 1) Imitation: that through a robot insect, the student deconstructs to reconstruct, 2) Construction step by step: now, students do not have the actual image about what to assemble, they know what they should do but do not know the final result, 3) programming the robot. The workshops had the total duration of 20 hours and participation of 25 students aged between 15 and 16 years, and the 9nd and 10nd grade, which had poor academic performance in the subjects of calculation. With the workshops was possible to analyze the possibility to use the insect robot as a mediator in the teaching-learning in math and physics, and also to help the interdisciplinary among mathematics, physics, computer science and Portuguese. For the results, we analyzed the student’s average at our school in mathematics and physics and we found that students who participated in the workshops of robotics, had a growth of 68% in mathematics and physics 87%, considering the annual school performance compared to students without the use of workshops (control group). With these significant results we intend to deploy the robotic educational workshops to other students in our school.

IS NEPHILA CLAVATA A NEW SPECIES OF SOCIAL SPIDERS? A PRELIMINARY STUDY ON BEHAVIORS OF NEPHILA CLAVATA
Sihan Jiang, Jiaqi Duan, Zihan Zhang
ZhengZhou Foreign Language School Campus, ZhengZhou, HeNan, CHINA

It is known that spiders are always solitary. There are more than 34,000 species of spiders in the world, but only 20 species were found to be social spiders. Nephila Clavata (short as NC) is not in the list of social spiders. However, we found thousands of NC spiders were in groups at Zhengzhou forest park, China. Then we wondered and proposed a bold guess: NC may be a new species of social spiders. <br><br>Firstly, we studied the behaviors of NC by combining field observation and current digital video technology in a whole year. <br><br>Secondly, we classified and established some systematic behavioral spectrums of NC, including weaving, hunting, last molting (initiation of reproduction), mating, spawning, wintering behaviors etc.<br><br>Thirdly, we discussed the social habits of NC from the aspects of ecological function, ontogeny, genetic evolution, and external stimuli. The main social features of NC include large number of clustered groups, high density of colony, long duration (several years) of aggregation, joint work, co-predator, and mutual defense. In addition, the social status and division of labor in NC population show the feature of "matriarchal society". Polyandry and “migratory marriage” in NC improve its individual mating rate and population genetic background. Colonies enhance the survival rate of hatchlings over the winter. Especially the rural-urban fringe, which lacks biodiversity and predators, provides a suitable habitat for NC to aggregate in groups with increased reproductive rate.<br><br>In a word, we concluded that NC is a new species of social spiders.

A disability walker is a four legged mobility equipment to assist disabled people to gain stability and their lost independence. 1.8 million People rely on walkers to get around or even to improve independence and mobility. However, current project should be done to develop new intelligent tool that cater the disabled navigating some difficult space. This project mainly was development to the ordinary walker in order to facilitate the limited abilities of disabled people by working on mechanical and technical additions to fix some obstacles were found in the way of the disabledpeople when they use the walker. A new design was practically applied having the following features: adjustable height, removable seat, basket plate, LDR and gear box for brakes system, number of circular 360 degrees wheels that may able to climb stairs, variable positions for hand placement. In conclusion, this walker improves mobility because its wheels allow a person to move 360 degrees and navigate tight spaces. It also responds to the environment while walking downhill, brakes slow a person down. In other words this new technology gives disabled people the freedom to get around.

DISCOVERING THE KEYS TO A POSITIVE, LIFELONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND THEIR NONDISABLED SIBLINGS: A WORLDWIDE STUDY TO HELP GUIDE PARENTS & SIBLINGS WITH THIS CHALLENGING RELATIONSHIP
Morgan Blueglass, Elyse Blueglass, Amanda Buonagurio
Somers High School, Lincolndale, NY

Countless efforts are dedicated to help adults with special needs; however, very few are dedicated to helping their nondisabled siblings. In order to analyze if there were any parenting trends that led to a positive, lifelong relationship between the nondisabled sibling and their sibling with special needs, an online survey was created measuring the behaviors, attitudes, and views of nondisabled siblings. The survey was distributed to sibling support groups and organizations focusing on people with special needs and their family members. Over 450 surveys were completed from 40 states in the USA and 17 additional countries. The way that parents present the challenge of having a sibling with special needs to their nondisabled child/children has the largest impact on the strength of the sibling relationship, at that point in time and in the future. If parents clarify to the nondisabled child about the disabilities of their sibling with special needs by creating an environment where they could discuss concerns they were having in regards to their sibling as well as being included in family decisions, then the relationship between the siblings were significantly more loving, caring, and overall positive, with lower levels of resentment and frustration. Just as nondisabled siblings can act as a support group for each other, if there is only one nondisabled child in the house, more emphasis needs to be placed on balancing the amount of attention given to each child. To continue this method of research, it is essential to closely analyze family dynamics in an effort to determine if the findings of this study holds true in different environments as well as involvement from other countries.

INVESTIGATING THE FAMILIAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS OF REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS IN AUTISM
Asa Toreen Jordan, Jenna Behrendt, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Autism has a genetic and non-genetic etiology. Studies have shown that relatives of children with autism may exhibit a variety of symptoms and traits that are phenomenologically related to autism, and that two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC25A12 gene may correlate with repetitive behaviors. Repetitive behaviors are a key characteristic of autism and are suggested to be exhibited within affected familial groups; yet little research has examined how they manifest in autism. This study investigated both the familial and genetic aspects of repetitive behaviors in autism. Factor analyses were performed on the Yale –Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and subjects' phenotypes were identified. The results showed that family members of an autistic child exhibited similar results in all the factors of the Y-BOCS: obsessions (p<0.001), high order repetitive behaviors (HOR) (p<0.001), low order repetitive behaviors (LOR) (p<0.01), and hoarding (p<0.01); and that the parents of autistic children only exhibited higher rates of obsessive compulsive traits in the hoarding factor (p<.01), while the siblings of autistic children had higher rates in all four factors (p<.05). Those who have the SNP rs2056202 are more likely to have an association with ordering compulsions (r=0.234, p=0.050). Trends appeared between subjects with the rs2056202 polymorphism and aggressive behaviors (r=-0.215, p=0.074), miscellaneous rubbing (r=0.216, p=0.072), LOR (r=0.216, p=0.072), and between the rs2292813 checking compulsions (r=-0.222, p=0.076) and HOR (r=-0.216, p=0.083). This provides evidence for the familiality of repetitive behaviors in autism and helps contribute to the understanding of the genetic risk for autism.

THE EFFECTS OF THE INITIAL TRANSITION FROM SHOD TO BAREFOOT RUNNING ON TIBIAL SHOCK AND MUSCLE ACTIVATION
Evan Daniel Olin, Catherine Conte, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Barefoot running has become increasingly popular among distance runners and many shod runners are transitioning to barefoot. Habitually shod runners tend to rear-foot (heel) strike, using the substantial padding of the shoe to dissipate impact. Barefoot runners accomplish this by utilizing a fore-foot (toe) strike technique and the eccentric action of the plantar flexors. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate transition from shod to barefoot running. Ten habitually shod, rear-foot strike recreational runners ran for 3 separate 7 minute trials, including shod heel strike (SHS), barefoot heel strike (BHS) , and barefoot toe strike (BTS) conditions. EMG, tibial shock, and knee angle were monitored and averaged over the 2nd, 4th, and 6th minute of each trial. A one-way MANOVA was conducted and several significant changes were noted. Specifically, EMG of the plantar flexors and peroneus longus, tibial shock, and knee flexion angle all increased in the transition. While it has been argued that barefoot, fore-foot strike running may be less injurious over the long run, these data indicate that habitually shod, rear-foot striking runners who chose to transition into a barefoot, fore-foot strike technique should undertake the process cautiously and patiently, as the initial change in mechanics may be detrimental.

THE GAME OF LIFE: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THREE TAXATION METHODS
Braeden Thomas Horton, Kelli Buhrdorf, Brydie Mitchell
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

This experiment was designed to examine the effects of three taxation methods on 110 subjects. The Flat, Fair and Progressive taxation systems were analyzed on 110 individuals and families that were created from the “Game of Life.” Profiles were developed through a random generated process that provided financial “life events” to be evaluated with the three different tax systems.<br><br>Sophisticated spreadsheets were developed using the components of the Flat, Fair and Progressive Tax Systems. A series of ANOVA tests were computed. There appear to be statistical differences between the three taxation methods in the areas of Total Taxes paid, Single taxpayers, Single Head of Household taxpayers, taxpayers with no children, and in the groups between 45-64 years of age. There, appeared to be no statistical difference in taxes paid between the three groups that had two or more children. In each case, groups appeared to be taxed highest in the Progressive tax system, with the exception of the elderly. For the purpose of this study the (2009) 1040 tax form was used, thus eliminating itemization.

THE BENEFITS OF COLORED PLASTIC OVERLAYS ON READING FLUENCY
Reva Ann Bork, Rhennetta Bork, 
Mitchell High School, Mitchell, SD

The purpose of the research was to test for improvement of reading fluency with the use of colored overlays. Stimulation of the cones (color sensing cells in the retina) triggers perception of finer detail and quick change in response to stimuli (Nave, 2011). 64% of the cones in the eyes are sensitive to red light. Colored overlays, especially red, should improve reading fluency because of their ability to stimulate the cones (Nave, 2011). <br><br> Testing consisted of each child reading four different fifth grade level passages. The first reading was black print on white paper. Each subsequent reading had a colored overlay on top. Subjects were given three minutes to read each passage. Mistakes and how long it took the child to read the passage were recorded. <br><br> A majority of the students (93%) of students tested read more words correctly when using any of the colored overlays. A statistical analysis showed the red overlay significantly improved the percentage of words read correctly over plain print (P = 0.003). The red overlay had the highest correct reading fluency (correct words/time) for 63.3% with an average increase of 12.77 words read correctly/minute. From the data, it was concluded that the use of colored overlays, specifically red, does help improve reading fluency in children. <br><br> In a standard 3/4th grade classroom with a 55 minute reading time/day, a fluency increase of 12.77 words/min would equal 702.35 more words read correctly during that one reading time.<br><br>The results could have astounding effects on success in school.

AN FMRI STUDY OF THE REGIONS OF BRAIN ACTIVATION WHILE PROCESSING SAT MATH PROBLEMS
Cara Marie Borelli, Qiuzi Zhu, 
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head, SC

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that measures changes in blood oxygenation to determine brain activity. In this pilot study, six high school students who have taken the SAT, an American standardized test, were asked to mentally solve a series of five SAT math word problems. The subjects' ages ranged from 16 to 18 (mean 17.17). All were well-rounded math students who scored a mean of 708.33 points (standard deviation 48.75) out of a total possible 800 points on the math portion of the SAT. It was predicted that the regions of the brain activated would be those associated with memory retrieval, arithmetic computations, and language, including specific areas in the posterior parietal cortex, frontopolar area, angular gyrus, and the temporal lobe. During the fMRI scan, participants alternated between a task period where they solved the math problems and a control period where they closed their eyes. The resulting 3D activation maps showed that when a teenager practices SAT math problems, the areas of the brain activated include many of the hypothesized regions. However, because this is a pilot study, the hypothesis cannot be accepted or rejected without further testing. If continued with a complete study and group level analysis, the brains can be normalized using Talairach coordinates. Because the language areas showed strong activation along with those typically associated with mathematics, the widely accepted idea that reading comprehension is one of the most complex parts of the SAT math portion is illustrated in a novel way: physiologically.

CAUTION! SIT RIGHT PAD THAT ENHANCES THE RIGHT SITTING POSTURE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BACK
Hayfa Khaled Al Bassam, Tyma Mohammed Hezam, 
Dhahran Ahliyya Schools, Dammam, East, SAUDI ARABIA

The simplicity of sitting can blind a person in realizing how serious are the hazards of wrong sitting posture. A study by the American Chiropractic Association states that back pain is one of humanity's most frequent complaints, Therefore, this project designed, constructed, and tested a pad that guides the user with the right sitting posture to reduce and prevent Dorsalgia and Lumbago, which result to less stress and lead to higher self-satisfaction and self-confidence. The pad was developed into 2 phases. One: A Pad with 4 force-pressure sensors that are placed on the spots which are pressured while sitting right. Two: The developed phase of the pad. It works on three electrical circuits for 3 postures. The sensors work to alert for the two wrong sitting postures, the slouching posture and slump posture, and the right sitting posture. The user will be notified when sitting wrong by different elements of alarms, and with a green light when sitting right. The pad was tested to find the level of back-pain indicated by each targeted group that varied from young girls to men, with and without the pad to prove the hypothesis. The results based on statistics, showed that the tests were less than the prespecified significance level, and therefore the hypothesis was proven; it showed improvement in the experimental groups’ back-pain level. We concluded that the pad is one of the keys to reduce and prevent Dorsalgia and Lumbago caused by wrong sitting postures while helping people lead more productive lives.

WHO DO YOU LISTEN TO?
Savanah Quinn Frisk, Coral Green, Shanice Grijalva
Kapaa High School, Kapaa, HI

The purpose of our experiment was to test high school students for the existance of a gender listening comprehension bias. To do this, we tested to see if students would score better on a test given on information read by a male or information read by a female. This test would also show us which gender, each gender of students listened more effectively to. To begin our experiment we gave a short introduction of our experiment to a group of mixed gender students then a female read the first story section out loud. The female read the three multiple choice questions to the group. Once everyone had answered we repeated the process with a male speaker, the second story secion and second set of questions. We tested 139 students overall, 85 females and 54 males. Our hypothesis was, If either gender reads a story out loud then, that same gender will score higher on the comprehension test then the opposite gender. The data we collectd shows our hypothesis to be unsupported. Male students and female students both scored higher on the comprehinsion test when the male read the story section. We ran the Chi-Squared statistical analysis on our numbers to make sure that the gender of the speaker was truely influencing the reseults and since the statistic returned a very low P-value, we can be 95% sure our data is significant. A side exponent our expeiment revealed is that when students were asked to listen to the male speaker both genders scored relatvely the same, when asked to listen to the female speaker the female students score significatly better then the male students. Our experiment supported the existance of a listening comprehension gender bias towards listening to a male speaker in teenage students.

IMPULSIVITY, OBSESSIVENESS, AND SCHOOL GRADES
Christina R. Wassef, Audrey Wassef, 
Clear Lake High School, Houston, TX

Background: We reported earlier that high obsessiveness and low impulsivity are associated with higher grades in core subjects. Herein, we hypothesized that these results would be replicable and that combining the two scales predicts the grades better. We also evaluated if the Obsessive Compulsive Personality Questionnaire (OCP) and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) would improve grade prediction over the Layton Obsessional Inventory Symptom Scale (OCD) and the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (IMP) used earlier. Moreover, we evaluated if the effect of personality characteristics relates to IQ.<br><br>Procedures: Ninety eight high school students anonymously completed the above mentioned scales and provided their grades in Math, English, Science and Social Sciences. The authors measured the IQ of 46 of these students. Analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Significance was set at two tailed p ≤ 0.05.<br><br>Results: Students with low impulsivity and high obsessive compulsiveness performed better, confirming our conclusions. When the two scales were simultaneously considered, grades were approximately a full GPA point higher in all core academic subjects. OCP better predicted academic performance than the OCD scale. IQ was a good predictor of academic performance (except in Math) but the effect of personality characteristics was independent of IQ. The BART test did not predict grades.<br><br>Conclusions: IMP and OCP provide an economically feasible method to identify students’ academic potential. Used simultaneously, they could forecast academic grades independent of the IQ. Wide scale use of IMP and OCP in high school system is recommended to identify student instructional needs.

PEER AND PARENT HEALTH BEHAVIORS
Alyssa Marie Blackburn, Gina Toumajian, 
Bellaire High School, Bellaire, TX

Current public health policies intended to decrease rates of risky health behaviors use methods that focus on the individual, and relatively little research examining peer and parent influence on health behavior has been conducted. Our project aimed to discover if any such correlation existed, and if so, to what extent. We hypothesized that any individual indulging in risky behaviors would have both friends and family members that also engaged in similar behavior. A convenience sample of students was selected to self-report information on personal health behaviors and health behaviors of parents and five friends. Questions were based on questions given on the National Health Insurance Survey. A sample of seventy nine students with a mean age of twenty two was interviewed in total. We initially tested for parental influence and the influence of all five friends and no significant association was found between either individual behavior and parental behavior or individual behavior and the behavior of five friends (p>.05). Subsequent tests using only the first two friends listed yielded significant p values (p<.05), indicating a strong association. Our results indicate that one’s closest friends have tremendous potential influence on an individual’s behaviors while the impact of his or her wider social network is, at least from a behavioral science perspective, negligible.

SONIFICATION: A NOVEL APPROACH TO DATA REPRESENTATION DIFFERENTIATION OF MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA
Michelle Xie, Dan Nguyen, 
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

With the advent of more and more multidimensional data, increasing limitations of visual information have been observed. New methods of representing data have emerged, like sonification, which uses non-speech audio to convey information. Further investigation of this method needs to be conducted in order to efficiently implement it, and our project proposes to explore the types of sound (by way of parameter mapping) that can most effectively convey information. <br><br>The first experiment investigates the parameter of sound that best improves differentiation. We hypothesized that changes in a sound parameter affecting amplitude, spatial distribution and frequency would improve the differentiation of multiple data streams, but sound waves composed of multiple sine functions would be differentiated the most. To test this, subjects were asked to listen to a series of sound sequences. The responses were then analyzed for improved differentiation in the experimental waveforms and the sawtooth waveform was found to be most differentiable.<br><br>The second experiment investigates more specifically the optimal method of conveying multiple streams of information. We hypothesized that representing the different data streams with combinations of different waveforms would enhance differentiation as compared to representing the data streams with the same waveform. This time, subjects were instructed to respond to changes in the speed of the sound blips playing. After analyzing the data, we concluded that when using changes of tempo to represent changes in data, "Log" and "Modified Sine" waveforms were most differentiable. Combinations of waveforms performed the worst in facilitating differentiation.

ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECTIVE INKBLOT AND MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES TEST CORRELATION IN A CLINICAL SETTING
Katlyn Marie Firkus
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the consistency of the correlation between the Projective Inkblot Test (P.I.) and Multiple Intelligences Test (M.I.). The rationale behind this experiment was to aid in the pursuit of creating a set of standards to Projective Inkblot tests, eliminating the controversy over the tests’ analysis methods. The hypothesis was that an individual’s expression of the correlation between the two tests would be significant across all demographic backgrounds and in the clinical testing environment. The specific aim was to show that there would be no statistical significance among the variables.<br><br>In order to obtain the M.I. expressions and P.I. responses of each participant, a printed survey of the M.I. was given alongside the presentation of three self-created inkblots. This survey consisted of a series of “Yes and No” questions regarding the intelligence categories and the inkblots were accompanied by questions regarding what the participant viewed and why. <br><br>Once completed, the responses were exported and analyzed for M.I. expression and respective corollaries. These results were divided into demographic groups and the descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. <br><br>The ANOVA and T-tests run on the number of corollaries found in each age group (F=1.31, df= 6, p=.268), gender (F=0.00, df= 1, p=.991), and ethnic group (F=1.75, df= 4, p=.150), proved the variances to be insignificant. This, the desired outcome, supports the hypothesis and the belief that the M.I. may hold the key to a viable set of standards for the P.I.

CAN WII TEACH SURGERY? DO VIDEOGAMES AND SURGERY SKILLS CORRELATE?
Megan V. Waples
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Surgery has evolved from open surgery to minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic surgery. During this time, videogames have become increasingly sophisticated and popular. Current surgical training often includes using animals to train surgical residents. Having a way to predict surgical skills and also train surgeons without the use of animal experimentation would be very useful. Prior to designing the experiment, interviews with multiple surgeons suggested this was a topic of interest in medical education and patient care. This study concerns whether videogame performance correlates with performance on a laparoscopic training device. There have been minimal studies on the correlation of video game skill and surgical skills especially with a more accessible laparoscopic box simulator. <br><br>Three sets of subjects (teenagers, adult non surgeons, and surgeons) were tested on two video games (one medically related) and two laparoscopic box (lap box) simulator tests. Statistical comparison of times and scores were conducted. One specific videogame was determined to be a better predictor of lap box skills and teenagers scored better than doctors at this game. Despite this, teenagers’ abilities on video games did not correlate with lap box performance. The study did show that specific sub-populations (whether or not adults played videogames and doctors who were laparoscopic/robotic surgeons) did have correlation between certain videogames and lap box tests. <br><br>Although this is a preliminary study, videogames could be a valuable addition to the traditional training of surgeons – “see one, do one, teach one.” Further study on video games and surgical simulation is needed.

MEDICATION OR CONFECTION II
Sarah Kathryn Bowles
Ackerman High School, Ackerman, MS

Do older children confuse medicines for candies or candies for medicine? Ten common medicines and ten candies were collected, glued on index cards, shellacked, and labeled in pencil on the back of the cards. The subjects were interviewed individually. Each index card was candy or medicine. Each age was talllied on interview sheet. The responses from each subject were tallied to see if the older subjects had a better response rate differentiating medicine from candy. The number of subjects available proved to be the most difficult obstacle in the project. Only 20 subjects were interviewed which resulted in a margin of error of 22.4%. If more subjects were interviewed, the error rate would be much lower. Time was the deciding factor in selecting only 20 Subjects.<br><br>No grade was 100% in identifying medicines and candies. Age was a major factor between 10th graders and 12th graders. One needs to be extremely careful with medications within a household since all ages can easily mistake candy for medicine.

THE EFFECT OF THE HUMAN LEARNING ALGORITHM ON TEST PERFORMANCE
Sagar Deepak Parikh
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

The purpose of this project is to test whether academic test performance, specifically in mathematics, is influenced by a human learning algorithm, directly relating to confidence level, and if so, what test pattern best fits the learning algorithm (e.g., what question pattern results in the best performance by a student). To test this, students were randomly assigned one of three question patterns: simple to difficult, difficult to simple, and the randomly ordered control. Students were given a common set of directions, and proceeded to take the test. Percentages of correct answers per question were gathered in each individual test group, graphed, compared, and then analyzed using 2-sample pooled T-tests to determine statistical significance. The significant differentials between average test performances as estimated by the average performance models for each test strongly suggest that there is a relationship between test order and test performance. This relationship was consistent with the alternate hypothesis proposed prior to experimentation based on previously suggested, untested test-taking strategies. Between Test 1 and 3, the P-value was determined to be .0195, significantly less than the standard accepted significance level of .05, meaning that this result is statistically significant. The second T-test had a much more significant result, producing a P-value of .0018, meaning that it is statistically significant as well. The increased statistical significance of the negative test in comparison to the positive test is interpreted to mean that the algorithm is more reactive to negative feedback than they are susceptible to positive feedback.

A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SONIFICATION COMPREHENSION: A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Neel S Patel
Oviedo High School, Oviedo, FL

In our technology-centric world, fields from finance to medicine use visual human-computer interfaces (HCIs) to interact with data. However, purely visual HCIs can present both physical (limiting mobility/multitasking) and cognitive (limiting range of thinking) barriers to users. This project studies the potential of sonifications, or non-speech audio patterns (through variation of pitch, intensity, and tempo), to overcome the limitations of traditional visual displays.<br><br> A low cost EEG headset was developed based on a Mattel MindFlex device. For this project, an Arduino circuit board was programmed and attached to read data directly from an EEG chip in the MindFlex and relay it to a computer, creating a viable EEG headset for less than $50.<br><br> The study then assessed comprehension of sonifications through information-synthesis tests, or questions that require a user to process and apply data from a sonification. Examples include “what would you expect the trend of the sonification to do in the next five seconds?” Results indicate a high degree of accuracy (76%) across various difficulty levels.<br><br><br> The final phase involved correlating specific patterns of brain activity with high- and low-comprehension groups. Analysis revealed that low-accuracy subjects had much higher peaks in brain activity as well as took longer to respond than high-accuracy subjects; this indicates that high-accuracy subjects exert less conscious brain activity and find the process of comprehending sonifications generally intuitive. This may be a parallel to System 1 and 2 thinking seen in daily life.

A SPECTRUM OF TRIANGULATION: ADHD, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMICITY, AND BIPOLAR SYMPTOMS
Travis Coleman Sigafoos
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

This study aims to investigate the theoretical triangulation between ADHD, circadian rhythmicity, and bipolar symptoms in adolescents. Moreover, the influence of comorbid disorders on the presentation of ADHD symptoms will be analyzed. An extensive library investigation elucidated significant connections between the underlying comparative biological bases within the triangulation. By using psychological assessments and surveys, data was collected online from a total of 80 informant sets. There are 8 instruments that are used in the study: (1) Consent Form, (2) ADHD Self-Report Scale: Symptom Checklist, (3) Sleep Deprivation Survey, (4) Circadian Rhythm Assessment, (5) MDQ-A Evaluation, (6) The SWAN Rating Scale, (7) NICHQ – School Performance Assessment, and (8) Medical History Form. The raw data was processed into value sets and the triangulation is investigated by means of statistical analysis. For example, in regards to the relationship between bipolar and ADHD symptom presentation, rs = 0.67, 95% CI [0.52, 0.78], p < .0001. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis is also utilized to determine the predictive significance of comorbidity values in differentiating ADHD patients from placebos. In conclusion, the magnitude of the triangulation is strong, as well as the potential efficacy for improving the diagnosis and treatment ADHD.

THE PSYCHO-SCHEMATIC CINEMATOGRAPHY OF FREE WILL
Amit Kahana
Israeli Arts and Science Academy, Jerusalem, ISRAEL

Free will is central to the debate between two grand theories in psychology: Behaviorism and Humanism. Behaviorists saw the individual as the sum of past experiences, with truly autonomous choices impossible. In contrast, humanists focused on the person's unique inner-nature, which under the appropriate circumstances guides self-directed behavior. Cinema, by focusing on human feelings and behavior, reflects this debate. This study shows how movies use aspects of cinematic aesthetical layout called cinematography, such as color, light, perspective, and symbolism, to present views about free will. I develop an original schematic model of how each perspective uses certain different aesthetical "psycho-schemas", with the behaviorist schemes directly contrasting the humanistic ones. I then illustrate how scheme-use in cinema reflects each perspective of the Free Will debate. By applying these schemes, directors efficiently emphasize the audience's perception and feelings of their movies.

HOW INVADERS BECOME QUEENS: TEMPORARY SOCIAL PARASITISM OF SPINY ANT, POLYRHACHIS LAMELLIDENS
Naoto Idogawa
Soka High School, Kodaira, Tokyo, JAPAN

The spiny ant, Polyrhachis lamellidens, uses a clever strategy for propagation called “temporary social parasitism”, whereby the queen occupies the nest of other ant species and makes her own colony. Because the spiny ant is a rare species, this process is not well understood. Studying the life cycle and parasitic habits of this curious ant may help in controlling social insects which are harmful for humans.<br><br>I collected an entire mature colony of the spiny ant. The colony consisted of more than 10,000 ants including one queen. Some other species were also found in the nest. The spiny ant queen has many offspring and can make a large colony during her life of a few years. <br><br>I observed the process of the spiny ant queen killing the host queen and her subsequent reproduction. I also attempted to artificially establish a spiny ant colony. During the killing, the spiny ant queen’s abdomen expanded, and right afterwards she laid her eggs. The host workers then took care of her eggs and larvae. The spiny ant queen may ingest the host queen’s fluid for egg laying. <br><br>Using a Scanning Electron Microscope, I examined external structures of several ant species and found that some social parasitic species including the spiny ant have a smooth body surface. The spiny ant queen is considered to take on the “scent” of the host worker, and this behavior might be related to structural features. In addition, other social parasitic species that I examined may also behave similarly.

EVALUATING SHORT-TERM EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Samantha Jaye Selby
Saint Clair High School, St. Clair, MO

Teenagers are an age group faced with much decision making that can forever affect their lives, either negatively or positively. High schools, local businesses, and organizations will spend a lot of money to sponsor motivational speakers to come and present to high schools. Common topics range from bullying to drugs to why they should go to college. Are these programs effective? Is there really a positive impact on the student’s decision making? This evaluation measured the students’ opinions of a guest speaker they have heard and determined if there was an overall change in perceptions of the students. The speaker evaluated spoke to a group of high school students about drug use and its negative effects. Those students were then administered a survey pertaining to the presentation they saw. Results showed a positive effect on the high school students, therefore the hypothesis was supported.

Kapa'a High School, Kapa'a, HI

This research explores the tendency to listen more effectively toward males. 352 students from the Kapaa school district in Kauai were tested for this tendency. Two classes from each grade level 3 to 12 were tested, one with a comprehension test previously recorded by a male, the other by a female. The voices read a short passage and five multiple choice questions. Data from each schooling level was tested for statistical significance. The elementary students showed a trend of listening more effectively to the female. The T-test and Confidence Interval were both found to be significant, returning a p-value of 0.005 which is less then 0.01. The difference in the mean scores is significant and it is supported that the gender of the speaker influenced the student's test scores, skewing them higher when the female spoke. The same process was followed for the middle and high school levels. The middle school students listened more effectively to the male speaker. The data was found significant with a p-value of 0.026. The high school students did not show a definite trend and the p-value was insignificant 0.347 > 0.05. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected for this school level. The gender of the speaker did not appear to have an affect on the high school students' test scores. I have made several speculations surrounding this outcome. These findings are incredibly significant as they point to a crucial age in the development of the listening bias, middle school. The bias is not present since birth, so it can be assumed that society is influential in it's development. One social influence is media, even today it glorifies the male authoritarian figure through heroes, businessmen, and political figures and middle school students are old enough to be influenced by this sexism.

IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN ABSENTEEISM AND RIT, LEXILE, AND GPA?
Victoria Lindsey Bruce
Ackerman High School, Ackerman

School is very important. It educates you and gets you ready for the rest of your life. It shapes the way you will live your life and cuts out your career. The purpose of this project was to state that school and attendance is very important. I think people should motivate themselves to go to school and be serious with their work. To get into any college you have to have a fairly high GPA, RIT, and Lexile score. I studied to see how absenteeism correlated with RIT, grade point average and Lexile. I collected all of my data from the school counselor, divided the people into groups according to how many days missed, averaged the scores together, and made tables of my data. I found that the more days missed, the lower the test scores.

DISTRACTION BY CONVENIENT TECHNOLOGICAL COMMUNICATION, PART II
Sara Voisard
Mid-Buchanan High School, Faucett, MO

A large majority of automobile accidents in the United States are caused by driver inattention. One factor of distraction for many drivers involves the cell phone. This study was conducted to determine whether there is a correlation between cell phone use and the amount of time it takes a driver to react to a stimulus. Testing involved a simulated driving course where subjects must carry on a conversation through talk and again through text on a cellular device while completing the course. The results of that test were compared with the results of a simulation the subject took prior without the use of a cell phone. This study is important to driving safety and the data could possibly be useful for legislation and insurance. The alternate hypothesis states that if subjects are talking or texting on a cell phone while driving, their reaction time will be slower.

THE EFFECT OF COFFEE EXTRACT & CAFFEINE ON THE LOCOMOTORY RATE AND BASAL SLOWING RESPONSE OF A LRRK2 TRANSGENIC CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS (G2019S MUTATION) MODEL OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Megan Smith
Shawnee Mission West High School, Overland Park, KS

This project investigated the effects of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine – substances epidemiological studies hypothesize protect against Parkinson’s disease (PD) – on the dopamine controlled locomotory rate and basal slowing response transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) with the G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common mutation linked to PD. These C. elegans, which have been shown to have locomotory rate dysfunction because of decreased levels of dopamine, were exposed to 10% (v/v) caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee or 3.6 mM caffeine from hatching. Significant improvements (p<0.01) in the locomotory rate and basal slowing response were noted in G2019S C. elegans treated with caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine when compared to the dysfunction in these behaviors observed in untreated G2019S C. elegans. All improvements occurred after the L4 molt and did not result from an alteration in lifespan. Thus, coffee and caffeine can likely be used to lessen the neurodegeneration and associated behavior dysfunction in the dopamine controlled locomotory rate and basal slowing response caused by inherited PD resulting from the G2019S mutation in LRRK2.

COMPILATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS, LINGUISTIC TWITTER PROFILE ANALYSIS, AND MEDIA BIAS TO ACCURATELY REFLECT REGIONAL POLITICAL CLIMATES
Shawn David Meacham
West Salem High School, Salem, OR

To gauge the effectiveness of social networking sites in reflecting regional and national political climates, commercially available software with geolocation capabilities, called “Viral Heat”, was used to compile the total conversation volume and positive sentiment of each GOP candidates’ last name on the social networking sites Twitter and Facebook. The number of shared Tweets (Retweets) and total impact (compiled by aggregating the followers of authors publishing relevant Tweets) was also used to reflect regional political climates. The percentage of positive Facebook sentiment pertaining to each candidate nationally strongly correlated with nationwide polls on 5/8 weeks, and on 5/7 weeks, sentiment on Facebook strongly correlated with regional polls in Iowa.<br><br> The Twitter profiles of major news organizations and each GOP candidate was analyzed using linguistic software, developed from writing samples of over 24,000 writers totaling 168 million words. The software categorizes text by emotional states, social connections, and thinking styles. On 4/5 weeks, the personable scores (measured by the frequency authors reference others and use positive emotion) and analytic scores (measured by ample usage of large words and phrases with complex thinking) of each candidate still in the GOP race strongly correlated with nationwide polls. The results are becoming increasingly accurate, as the GOP presidential race becomes more concentrated.<br><br> This study has shown the validity of social networking and media bias analysis in accurately, consistently, and cost-effectively reflecting both regional and national political climates in real-time.

PHYSIOLOGY OF SELF-CONTROL: DOES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL HAVE AN EFFECT ON SELF-CONTROL?
Chad Deniz Erturk
Spartanburg Day School, Spartanburg, SC

A growing body of literature claim that self-control relies on a resource. This research claims that when self-control is exerted this resource, which is reported as glucose, is depleted from the peripheral blood. It is also reported that when this resource is unavailable individual will be able to exert less control. An opposing view claims that self-control is regulated by a motivational mechanism rather than metabolic. In this project, I investigated the effects of glucose on self-control as well as the self-control vs. non-self-control task on the depletion of glucose from blood by using rats as a model system. My results show that self-control tasks do not deplete glucose neither does the injection of glucose improve self-control. I also used Scratch visual programming language to create scenarios to simulate self-control, immediate reward and forced trials. I also created an interactive scenario that allows the observer to suggest a condition and then observe how the rat would respond to this data in real life.

UTILIZATION OF AUDIO AND VISUAL PROMPTING TO AID DEMENTIA PATIENTS WITH DAILY TASKS
Divya Koyyalagunta
Clear Lake High School, Houston, TX

Almost 14% of people over the age of 71 have some form of Dementia. As Dementia progresses, it impacts the ability to function independently and increases the burden on caregivers. To evaluate the feasibility of machine based prompting in aiding Dementia patients with daily tasks, audio/visual prompting were used in the place of a caretaker for three basic tasks: hand washing, donning a sweater, and covering a pillowcase.<br><br>Eight subjects were initially proctored a MMSE (Mini-Mental Status Examination) to determine severity of dementia, and then asked to complete each of the three tasks using only audio cues. A VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) was used to record the level of difficulty of which the patient had in completing the task. After waiting a day, the patients were tested with visual cues for the tasks not completed with audio cues and evaluated again using the VAS.<br><br>Overall it was observed that subjects were able to complete the hand washing and donning a sweater task with just the audio cues, but the third task of putting on a pillowcase required visual cues for a majority of subjects. This showed that more difficult tasks that subjects were not as accustomed to required more thorough prompting. As seen in the study, machine prompting permitted a large success rate for patients in completing tasks in the absence of a caretaker. As dependency on caretakers increases in number with a growing elderly population, machine based prompting could be a viable alternative to caretakers in everyday life.<br><br>

SHAPING YOUR THOUGHTS
Hana Kim Ulman
Hedgesville High School, Hedgesville, WV

The purpose for this project is whether or not mismatched shapes will have the same effect as the Stroop Effect, and when presenting this test to second graders will their results different from those who have higher reading levels?<br><br> <br><br>The procedure for the Stroop Effect: First, print off the Stroop Effect tests. The first row consists of colors that do not match the word. The second row consisted of colors that did match the word. Test the volunteers by asking the volunteers to name both rows; recording the time. Subtract the two rows to find the time difference. <br><br>The Shape test procedure: First, print off two different types of shapes test. For instance, it would have a square and the word printed within would be triangle. The second row had matching shapes and words. The volunteers were asked to name the shape not the actual word. Test the volunteers. Ask them the two rows; record the time in the data table. Subtract the two rows to find the time difference.<br><br> <br><br>The average second grader-completed row one of the Stroop Effect in eleven seconds and row two in five seconds; they completed row two of the Shape tests in seventeen seconds and row two in six seconds. <br><br>The conclusion is that the Stroop Effect along with the Shape tests affected the second graders just as much as it affected those who have been literate for many years.

WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY AND ITS CORRELATION TO SOCIAL DEFICITS FOUND IN THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
Colton Michael Green
Cedarcrest High School, Duvall, WA

This study further explores how working memory capacity factors into social responses; specifically, social deficits found in the Autism Spectrum. This research project should enlighten the scientific community and help them better understand social deficits typical from Autistic individuals. It was hypothesized that if there is a relationship between the total working memory capacity of a person with and without an Autism Spectrum Disorder that a person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder will have a lower working memory capacity and therefore further explaining their social deficit because the ability to modify social responses is a function controlled by working memory. There was no relationship found in working memory capacity between individuals with and without Autism using the Operation-Word Span Task. Ten total Autistic and non-Autistic males between the ages of 15 and 25 were tested. Data was collected from the answer booklets of the test to ultimately calculate a numerical value to represent working memory capacity. The data was analyzed and the standard deviation was found for each of the two test groups. This was used in a “Two-Sample T” test to determine that there was not a statistical significant difference between individuals with and without and Autism Spectrum Disorder. In conclusion, the hypothesis stated was not supported by the data collected from the Operation-word Span Task. Therefore, the insignificant correlation of working memory capacity between the two groups shows that a lower working memory capacity is not factor in social deficits found in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

ARE SOME DISABILITIES MORE HANDICAPPING THAN OTHERS? A COMPARISON OF TEACHER GRADING OF CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL, PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISABILITIES
Brett Evan Gossett
John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore, NY

This study was designed to assess teacher bias regarding behavioral, physical or medical disabilities and its affect on their grading of student work. A cohort of 5184 middle school teachers nation-wide were asked to rank three essays as part of a national fictitious essay contest in which children with disabilities were asked to write about overcoming their respective disabilities. The teacher sample was comprised of 24 equal demographic subgroups with respect to gender, census region and population density. Each teacher received three “generic” essays, one supposedly written by a child with ADHD (behavioral), one by a child with Cerebral Palsy (physical) and one by a child with diabetes (medical). The essays were generic in that the disabilities could be interchanged without compromising the structure of the essay. A total of 557 respondents completed and returned their response sheet. Essays were ranked based on grammar & syntax, spelling & punctuation, organization, writing style, emotional appeal and overall ranking. When analyzed, the results suggest that teachers were more sympathetic towards children with Cerebral Palsy. The teachers ranked the Cerebral Palsy essays “best” 51 percent of the time; this was more than both the ADHD and diabetes essays combined. More education and sensitivity training for teachers concerning the difficulties surrounding “non-visible” disorders (including behavioral and medical disorders) are likely needed in the future to ensure that all children are truly given the same educational opportunities.

OMG: LOOK WHO JOINED FACEBOOK! THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTING AND ADOLESCENT RISK BEHAVIORS
Benjamin Jake Kornick
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Research has shown that high levels of parental knowledge, parental solicitation, parental control, and parent-child closeness predict fewer adolescent risk behaviors offline. However, this study was the first to look at whether those same factors predict fewer adolescent risk behaviors online and the role that online "friendship" plays in predicting risky behaviors. High school students (N=133) completed a 74-item survey about their relationship with their parents and their participation in risky behaviors offline and online. Regression analyses indicated that the models explained 20% of the variance in offline risk behaviors and 11% of the variance in online risk behaviors. In terms of offline risk behaviors, parental knowledge predicted fewer risky behaviors. Parental control and parent-child closeness were the best predictors of parental knowledge; however, they did not explain variance in offline risk behaviors above and beyond that of parental knowledge in the hierarchical multiple regression and were found to be mediated by parental knowledge. Parental solicitation did account for additional variance in risk behaviors, but unlike parental control and parent-child closeness, it was a positive predictor of risk behaviors both offline and online. In fact, parental solicitation was the only significant predictor of online risk behaviors in the hierarchical logistic regression, underscoring the need for additional research to identify the particular factors that may help explain the risks teens take online.

THE EFFECTS OF MULTI-TALKER BACKGROUND NOISE ON OVERT SPONTANEOUS SPEECH PRODUCTION
Josh Feng
Sheboygan North High School, Sheboygan, WI

Previous research has shown that English multi-talker babble hinders serial recall/speech comprehension in English monolinguals more than foreign babble. The goal of this experiment was to see if these results remained tenable during speech production by analyzing the effects of background noise on rate of speech (ROS), an excellent indicator of proficiency. It was expected that the average ROS during English noise would be lower compared to Chinese noise for English monolinguals due to increased informational masking, while the mean ROS for Chinese and silent conditions would be similar.<br><br>Two-talker background babble was produced by native English and Chinese speakers who recited syntactically normal sentences that were mixed and removed of silent gaps. Participants listened to various audio prompts and responded to these stimuli with speech while English, Chinese, or no background babble was presented through headphones.<br><br>ROS was determined using a Praat script that automatically measured syllable nuclei in speech files by analyzing peaks in sound intensity. Total number of syllable nuclei was divided by total duration of speech to produce ROS measurements. Although the mean ROS during English noise (2.54593 syllables/second) deviated slightly from the Chinese and silent conditions (2. 56368 and 2.56767 respectively), the size of this effect is too small to become statistically significant. ANOVA analysis made evident that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected (P=.926). Further analysis adjusted for variation between participants supported these results. Contrary to popular belief, background noise may not have as large of an effect on speech production as often thought.

OPTOGENETIC INTERROGATION OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX DOPAMINE D1 RECEPTOR-CONTAINING NEURONS AS A TECHNIQUE TO RESTORE TIMING: A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREAT PREFRONTAL DISORDERS
John Edward Solder
Staples High School, Westport, CT

Millions suffer debilitating prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairments. Current treatment options are limited; medications affect molecular mechanisms systemically and deep brain stimulation is region- but not mechanism-specific. This project used novel optogenetic interrogation methods to study: 1) the role of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic projections and dopamine D1-receptor containing PFC neurons in the control of timing behavior, a relatively understudied PFC function critical to daily activities, and 2) optogenetics as a mechanism- and region-specific approach to treat PFC impairment. In work performed in collaboration with a team of university researchers, impaired interval timing performance of rats was observed after dopaminergic blockade both in the VTA and of PFC dopamine D1 receptors, supporting the importance of this brain system in timed responses. Performance improved after PFC fiberoptic light delivery to mice that expressed 473nm, blue laser light-sensitive activating channels, Channelrhodopsin-2, specifically in dopamine D1 receptor-containing neurons. This showed PFC D1 neuron optogenetic stimulation can improve PFC-related timing performance. Constructs were developed to test a final hypothesis that optogenetic stimulation of postsynaptic PFC D1 receptor-containing neurons, via blue light sensitive activating Channelrhodopsin-2, is sufficient to compensate for a loss of VTA dopamine signaling in mice expressing unfloxed 590nm yellow light-sensitive inhibitory channel halorhodopsin in VTA neurons. The findings demonstrate the importance of PFC D1 neurons in adaptive control of timing responses and provide a novel optogenetic treatment model for PFC disorders, including those arising from impairments upstream.

WHAT ARE THE CORRELATIONAL EFFECTS BETWEEN TEACHING STYLE, HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE AND STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE?
Tessa Ray Carver
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Existing research has linked hemispheric dominance with student’s learning capabilities. This study was designed to determine if a teaching style, formatted to match a particular type of hemispheric dominance, would improve student academic performance. It was hypothesized that lessons formatted to match the learning style associated with a particular hemispheric dominance would improve academic performance as demonstrated on subsequent tests of the material taught. Two hundred thirty-four students were assigned to participate in one of two lesson plans, one using right-brain strategies (intuitive, creative, non-verbal) and the other using left-brain approaches (logical, structured, verbal). Students were compared on pre/post-test scores to determine if the matched teaching style resulted in improved performance. The results of the study disproved the hypothesis since no group taught using the right-brain lesson plan had statistically significant gain scores between the pre/post-test. However the results did establish that students who were right-brain and middle-brain were especially apt to benefit from the left-brain teaching approaches. These gain scores reached the level of statistical significance at a confidence interval of 75%. Further, teachers were given the same hemispheric dominance inventory and a survey questioning which teaching style they believed was most conducive to learning. In spite of the positive findings for left-brain teaching strategies found here, only 5% of teachers report that a left-brain teaching style was most effective, with the other 95% preferring a right or middle-brain approach. While additional research is warranted, it appears teachers should use a left-brain approach for greater success in the classroom.

THE EFFECTS OF THE MAJORITY'S OPINION ON MINORITY'S DECISION IN RELATION TO GRADE LEVEL
Elias Bradley Johnson
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

This project examined effects of the majority’s opinion on the minority’s decision in relation to grade level. Participants in 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 12th grade were tested. Confederates answered first, and then the answers of participants that were unaware of the experiment were recorded and calculated. Based on scientific literature, it was hypothesized that 3rd graders would conform the most followed by 8th, 5th, and 12th grade participants. <br><br> Tests were conducted for all grade levels with an increase in difficulty between tiers. In tier two, 3rd graders conformed the most with no statistical significance between the upper three grades. In tier three, there was not statistical significance between 3rd, 5th, and 8th grade participants who all conformed at higher rates than 12th grade. A computation of tiers show 3rd graders conformed the most, followed by 5th and 8th grade, where there was no statistically significant difference. The 12th grade participants conformed the least.<br><br> The data indicates that in situations where material is easy to comprehend students are willing to formulate their own responses at the risk of standing out. However, when concepts are harder to comprehend, students in lower grades rely heavily on peer input. <br><br> This is important because the data suggests teachers implement less group work in lower grade levels and when teaching concepts that are difficult to understand. This would be to ensure students grasp concepts and are working through problems by themselves. However, it is not necessary in 12th grade where they generally formulate their own responses.

THE EFFECTS OF THE PLACEBO EFFECT AND CAFFEINE ON CONCENTRATION
Bruce B. Biegler
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD

The Placebo Effect is a change in health or behavior due to a fake treatment being administered, as the recipient of the fake treatment believes he or she received a real treatment. Caffeine, the ingredient in several beverages such as coffee and soda pop, is known to increase concentration. Therefore, if caffeine is known to increase concentration, then drinking a beverage believed to contain caffeine, but doesn’t actually contain caffeine, also increases concentration due to the Placebo Effect. The purpose of this project was to test this hypothesis. Volunteers were divided into four groups named as the “caffeine group,” the “placebo caffeine group,” the “decaf group,” and the “placebo decaf group.” After drinking the specified coffee, the subjects then took a one-minute long concentration test. From the results it was concluded that both caffeine and believing caffeine was being ingested increased concentration. This supported the hypothesis that the Placebo Effect was significant in subjects' concentration. In an addition, it was found that students had better concentration than adults especially in the “caffeine” and “decaf” categories. Both placebo categories had similar age comparisons.

DOES TETRIS MAKE YOU SMARTER? A LONGITUDINAL FMRI STUDY
Courtney Kate Guo
International School of Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

The effects of video games on human brains have not been well studied. Some think that playing video games is beneficial to intellectual development, while others believe that video games are not desirable for teenagers. The purpose of this project is to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study the effects of Tetris on the human brain during play and after practice, and test whether Tetris may enhance subjects’ performance in an IQ spatial rotation test.<br><br>fMRI detects blood oxygenation changes, which has a correlation to neural activity, enabling us to detect the activation and deactivation in human brains when playing Tetris. The experimental group practiced Tetris for 12 hours over 6 weeks while the control group was instructed not to play Tetris. Both groups had fMRI scans at the start and end of the study. At each MRI session, each subject underwent two tasks – the Tetris task and the rotation test.<br><br>The results showed that the activation areas for both the Tetris and rotation tasks have large overlaps in the posterior areas of the brain including the motor cortex, visual cortex and somatosensory cortex, while the deactivation areas have large overlaps in the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate, which are related to rational thought processing, and strategic processing. In comparison with the IQ rotation test scores, the experimental group’s accuracy improved by 7.6 percentage points while the control group’s accuracy improved by only 0.6 percentage points. Taken together, these results suggest that playing Tetris may benefit performance on a spatial rotation test.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT MORAL DECISION-MAKING: A BEHAVIORAL AND FMRI STUDY
Katherine Michelle Mangialardi
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Moral decisions play an integral role in human life, and it is crucial to determine how the context of a situation can alter such decisions. This study attempted to understand the basis of altruistic behavior in realistic moral decision-making through functional neuroimaging. A computerized variation of the Dictator Game was created and subjects were presented with variations of a hypothetical moral dilemma, in which they were asked to choose whether to keep or return a found wallet. Data were analyzed as functions of the probability of getting caught (consequence), the contained monetary amount, the wallet’s owner (social connectedness), and the time it took to make the decision. The data were segregated by gender and the functional imaging study employed only female subjects. Overall, female subjects acted more altruistically than males, choosing to turn in the wallet more often (p<0.001). However, when positive connectedness existed between the owner of the wallet and the subject, males opted to turn in the wallet more often than females. Increasing monetary values resulted in a decrease in the number of “keep” decisions. Modulation of the consequential variable had the greatest capacity to impact subjects’ decisions. When consequential certainty was high, neural activation was observed in temporal and parietal lobe structures (p<0.05). However, when there were no external consequences, the decision process engaged frontal regions and the ventral striatum (p<0.05). Findings suggest that the implementation of consequences employs neural mechanisms involved in executive decision-making, while moral decision-making in the absence of consequences may engage neural regions that evaluate moral content by means of recalling past experience.

THE EFFECT OF GROUP THERAPY ON COMMUNICATION IN APHASIA
Laura Marie Anderson
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Aphasia, the total or partial loss of language abilities due to stroke or other brain injury, affects over 1,000,000 people in the United States. Therapy for aphasia may be individual and/or in a group setting. Group therapy, in particular, provides patients with the opportunity to practice communication skills. Goals of this study were to gain a better understanding of: (1) communication difficulties patients with aphasia and their caregivers face daily; (2) how they cope with these difficulties; and (3) how participating in group therapy affects their perception of their communication abilities. Two anonymous surveys consisting of four question categories were distributed and completed by patients and caregivers nationwide. Results revealed that participation in group therapy increases the ability to communicate and decreases the patient's self-report of depression and self-perceived handicap. Group therapy is an effective method of helping post-stroke aphasia patients and their caregivers cope with communication difficulties associated with aphasia.

EFFECTS OF INTONATION ON COGNITIVE LEARNING
Shannon Catherine Boley
Westfield High School, Westfield, MA

This experiment tested whether a female presenter’s tone of voice, monotone or animated, affected high school students’ abilities to recall information. It was hypothesized that the animated video would spur higher performance in recall of information. <br><br> A script on the topic of narwhals was presented in two differing videos by an educator to sixty honors level high school students each, after which an assessment measuring recall was administered. <br><br> While the results were statistically insignificant, the following trends were noted: students who listened to the monotone video presentation performed higher than those who listened to the animated one. Females’ scores were higher than males on average, and were superior after the animated presentation. Males had the opposite effect by scoring higher with the monotone presentation within their gender. Similarly, regarding the Halo Effect, women associated the presenter’s animated voice with higher intellect, while males assumed greater intelligence with the monotone presentation. Students watching the more animated video rated their interest level and quality of the presentation more positively. Students who rated those topics highly also tended to recall more information. <br><br> According to the results in this study trends would indicate that the stigma against a monotone voice is inaccurate. The data also suggests that genders differentiate not only in their perception of intelligence but in their ability to recall information.

THE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL DECISION MAKING ON POST DECISION REGRET
Emily Katherine Hu
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

Mindfulness is the ability to perceive, accept, and adapt to the changing world. It’s influence on the decision making process has become increasingly important as our world continues to evolve. The present research attempted to determine the relationship between mindful decision-making and post decision regret. It was hypothesized that trait mindfulness is an indicator of decreased post decision regret and that state mindfulness, produced by experimental intervention, will lessen post decision regret.<br><br> A total of 60 subjects were tested. Subjects were given either low mindful or high mindful intervention as a priming technique prior to testing. They were then asked to complete a simulation of an economic game in which they had to make a series of choices. After testing, subjects were asked a series of post game questions that were designed to measure different levels of post decision affect, specifically regret. <br><br> The data shows that mindfulness as both a trait and a state has a mitigating effect on post decision regret. Data proves that mindful individuals feel happier, see the world as brighter, have more fun, and feel better about their choices (p<0.05). Moreover, the data confirms that high mindful individuals tend to be more emotionally consistent and predictable than their low mindful counterparts. <br><br> Further research may include further investigation of the role of various physiological and visual stimuli on mindful decision making and subsequent post decision affect.

BOOSTING THE ADHD BRAIN: EFFECTS OF GUM CHEWING AND CAFFEINE ON COGNITION AND MEMORY IN ADOLESCENTS WITH ADHD
Zarin Ibnat Rahman
Brookings High School, Brookings, SD

Attention-Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the leading childhood psychiatric disorders affecting mostly school-aged children. It is characterized by impairments of attention, concentration, hyperactivity, and working memory deficits. Additionally, ADHD behavior is in direct conflict with the demands of the classroom which are challenging for ADHD students to navigate and may limit their ability to succeed in academic performance. Recent research demonstrated that gum chewing has beneficial effects on cognition including attention and memory. Furthermore, evidence shows that caffeine can help arouse attention level and boost memory in humans. Therefore, it was expected that chewing gum along with caffeine would improve performance on memory and attention tasks in persons with ADHD. In a crossover study, adolescents with ADHD were examined. All participants were assessed in conditions with gum, caffeine plus gum and without gum. A series of neuropsychological tests that assess attention (SynWin and Stroop), concentration (reading comprehension), and working memory (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and word recall) were administered. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test. The findings suggest that compared to a no-gum control, chewing gum and caffeine plus gum significantly (p<0.05) improved aspects of attention and memory, but didn’t significantly affect concentration. The information from the study will help people find possibilities of using gum or a combination of gum and caffeine in situations where an improved executive functioning is required, such as tests at school, to reduce the risks of neurobehavioral related disorders like ADHD and improve academic performance.

EXAMINING THE SOCIAL COGNIZANCE OF RETT SYNDROME PATIENTS USING EYE-GAZE TECHNOLOGY
Kathleen Margaret Mavrommatis
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Rett Syndrome is the most physically impairing neurodevelopment disorder on the Autism Spectrum. Severe physical limitations cause them to suffer with communicative difficulties. Research has found that eye movements provide a behavioral index of cognitive processing. This was an indication that eye gaze technology might be an effective way to analyze the social awareness of patients. It was hypothesized that patients would demonstrate similar eye gaze behaviors as Non-Rett controls when they are presented with photographs of emotional stimuli (human faces). Six images of emotional faces were presented to participants through the Tobii T120 gaze tracking device. T-tests were used to compare Rett and Non-Rett participants on four fixation metrics for the eyes, nose, mouth, and whole face region of each face. This yielded 192 Rett to Non-Rett comparisons, of which there were only 3 significant differences. These results provide evidence that patients observe emotional stimuli in ways similar to Non-Rett controls. This may indicate that patients comprehend what they see in a similar way that Non-Rett individuals do. In the future, similar experiments including age matched controls, a larger sample size, and video clips may be appropriate follow up studies to strengthen the connection between vision and cognition.

IS DOMINANCE STATUS A POTENTIAL CONFOUND IN DAT TRANSGENIC MICE?
Afolayan Kehinde Oladeji
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose: Studies of transgenic mice presume that observed phenotypes are the result of the transgenic manipulation, but generally have failed to take into account the possibility that many of the observed phenomena could be collectively the result of an intervening endophenotype such as dominance.The present studies were undertaken to determine whether dominance may be affected by genetic manipulations of DAT. <br><br>Methodology: The strains studied were the DAT KO, a congenic C57BL/6J DAT KO strain derived from the original DAT KO strain, and the CI-DAT strain. Wildtype mice (+/+) were compared to heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) knockout mice, and in some cases both females and males were compared. Dominance was assessed using a naturalistic test in which two mice (always a +/+ mouse versus a +/- or -/- mouse of the same sex) were simultaneously placed in a small diameter opaque plastic tube to induce competition for the preferred position (Lindzey et al., 1961 ). In this situation the dominant mouse pushed the subordinate mouse out of the tube. This measure of dominance has a high correlation with other measures of dominance observed either in the home cage or in circumstances contrived to induce aggression. <br><br>Conclusion: Differences in DAT genotypes in transgenic mice appear to be associated with differences in dominance, which may present a confounding factor for the interpretation of some of the behavioral sequelae of these transgenic manipulations. DAT KO, DAT BX KO and CI-DAT mice were all more likely to be dominant, although these effects were only statistically significant in male DAT -/- mice (vs. DAT +/+ mice) – due to the low number of subjects that have been able to be tested thus far.

ROLE OF THE BASAL FOREBRAIN IN MEDIATING SELECTIVE ATTENTION
Apoorva Mylavarapu
Torrey Pines High School, Encinitas, CA

The basal forebrain is the primary area for production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which has applications in learning and attentional processes. Since cholinergic neurons have important implications in learning and memory, the goal of this project was to determine the role of neurons in the basal forebrain in a learning-dependent behavioral task. This project analyzes the influence of spatial probability distributions with different variances on the attentional behavior of rats as well as the neuronal firing rates of neurons in the substantia innominata and ventral pallidum of the basal forebrain. Rats were placed in a circular arena with 36 manually operated LED lights on the perimeter, and rewarded based on successful identification of flashed lights. Neuronal firing data was acquired from two electrodes inserted in the basal forebrain. I analyzed all data in MATLAB by writing code to compare neuronal and performance data. I determined the significance of firing rate modulations at various stages of the task by results of randomized t-tests between successful and failed trials. Preliminary results suggest that rodents adapt their attention to variable distributions of stimuli, and that many neurons in the basal forebrain have differential event-based firing patterns consistent with a role in intelligent adaptation of attention across task stages. This research also reveals that outcome-specific firing patterns evolve over time and largely depend on spatial distribution of stimuli. Applications of studying this subset of basal forebrain neurons include understanding Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases and creating effective, targeted treatments for memory and learning-related disorders.

Factors Contributing to Success of Native American Teen Mothers<br><br> Juana Espinoza<br><br> South Senior High School, Minneapolis MN <br><br>12th grade<br><br> Behavioral and Social Science<br><br> <br><br>The goal of this project was to determine if there are specific factors that contribute to the success of Native American teen mothers. The rate of teen pregnancy among Native American teenage women is over 36% in Minneapolis and, given this rate, it is important to know what factors contribute to their future success. It was hypothesized that the teenage mothers who had the most resources would have the highest success rates. Minneapolis area Native American women who were at least 25 years of age and were teenage mothers were recruited for this study. Thirty-six participants filled out an anonymous survey about their experiences. Participants were divided into three groups: highly successful (having a college degree, good paying job, and at least a 7 on the happiness scale), moderately successful (having two of these conditions), and not yet successful (having 0 or 1 of these conditions). The successful mothers had an average of 4.6 resources, the moderately successful 3.0, and the not yet successful 3.67. A one way ANOVA was chosen to further analyze the results. ANOVA results showed that the differences between these three groups are significant. A Friedman analysis was done to determine if there was a difference that was statistically significant for any of the resources that were obtained. Statistically significant resources included housing and health care. If the researcher was able to make recommendations to the community, she recommends making counseling, programs for teen moms, transportation, tutoring, and better day care a priority.

PREDICTING REAL WORLD CHARACTERISTICS FROM VIRTUAL BEHAVIOR
Athman Ramana Adiseshan
Ramana Academy, San Jose, CA

In this study, I examined whether and how demographic profiling and personality are expressed in Virtual Worlds (VWs). The purpose of the study was to determine the accuracy rates with which real world demographics and personality traits can be predicted based on virtual behaviors.<br><br> Survey data from 1,040 World of Warcraft players, from the US and Hong Kong/Taiwan, containing demographic and personality variables was paired with their VW behavioral metrics over a four-month period. The VW behavioral metrics were gathered by two monitoring systems that tracked the players. From this data, 435 behavior variables were described, extracted, and analyzed.<br><br> I predicted real world demographics such as age, gender, marital status, job status, education level, and nationality for the 1,040 players through machine learning methods. The results showed that one can predict age within +/- 4.7 years in terms of Mean Absolute Error. Prediction accuracy rates of demographic variables are as follows: gender is 73%, marital status is 68%, nationality is 70%, job status is 60%, and education level is 75%.<br><br> I also predicted the personality traits of players from the Big-5 Personality Model: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional stability, and Openness to experience based on the significant positive and negative correlations between the virtual behaviors and the personality factors. Many behavioral cues in VWs were found to be related to personality. <br><br> In conclusion, virtual behavioral metrics can be used to provide statistically significant models of a player’s personality and demographic profile. This study is relevant in the design of personalized interfaces, system customizations, recommender systems, and online predictive analytics/ad supported services.

DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE IN WORKING AND REFERENCE MEMORY ON AN ALZHEIMER'S MODEL
Leanna Lorraine Rivera
Clint High School, Clint, TX

By doing a behavioral study on rats using learning and memory tests the results will help us understand if caffeine can play a role in adenosine receptor interaction with learning and memory function. There are adenosine receptors located in the hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Caffeine is an antagonist for the adenosine receptor and has a closely related chemical structure to adenosine. The blockage of receptors will be induced by giving a drug, Scopolamine, which was used as a model for Alzheimer’s. Habituation and Baseline Body Weights: Rats were habituated to become comfortable with the experimenter and were handled for 5 days. Food availability was restricted to rats so that body weights decreased to no less than 90%. Rats began testing, which spanned 2 days (learning phase on Day 1, savings phase on Day 2). Fruit Loops cereal was presented in the home cage to familiarize rats with reinforcer. Lab personnel administered Caffeine 60 minutes following Scopolamine treatment. Testing began 10 minutes after Caffeine treatment. The rat was placed in the center of the maze with access to all arms and it was allowed to explore the maze completely until it retrieved all food rewards. Upon retrieval of all reinforcers the rat was removed from the maze for a 15 minute Intertrial Interval (ITI). After the ITI was complete the rat was placed into the radial arm maze with the same arms baited. The caffeine affected working memory negatively on the scopolamine induced Alzheimer’s model. There is enough data to conclude that reference memory was not affected in a positive or negative way. This information is very important to know because only one type of memory is being affected, but not the other.

QUANTIFYING HUMAN COMPENSATION FOR VISUAL PROCESSING LAG
Stephen Thomas Kranich
West Anchorage High School, Anchorage, AK

The purpose of this experiment was to quantify the flash-lag effect and discover if it was consistent across the demographic groups of age and sex. The flash-lag effect describes the ability of the brain to project a moving object ahead of its true location to compensate for visual processing lag. It was hypothesized that people would consistently project, and that this would be consistent between sexes, but not between age groups, with younger participants projecting more than older ones. A convenience sample of 100 participants was presented with a SuperLab 4.0 computer program that measured the flash-lag effect on a linear and rectangular path. Data analyses revealed no significant effects when participants were tested with the linear motion path. However, testing participants with a rectangular motion path produced several significant effects and interactions. Participants projected the moving stimulus when the flash occurred in a foveal retinal position but lagged when the flash occurred in the periphery; this tendency was greater for women than for men. Participant reports of projection vs. lag were also subjected to an absolute values transformation in order to examine accuracy. When transformed data were analyzed, men were more accurate than women, and all participants were more accurate on average with foveal than with peripheral stimulus presentations. In addition, participant age interacted with stimulus speed; at the slow speed, participants of all ages were equally accurate. However, at a fast speed, younger participants (18-20 years of age) were more accurate than older ones (21 and older).<br><br>

THE STROOP EFFECT: TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THE STROOP EFFECT BE NEGATED THROUGH WORD DISTORTION AMONG DIFFERENT GENDER, AGE, AND BRAIN DOMINANCE DEMOGRAPHICS?
Ka Yan Lee
Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

The Stroop Effect refers to the interference between saying the color versus seeing the color of the word and its meaning.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to determine if the Stroop Effect could be negated through word distortion. This study was examined in the following four categories: as a whole, gender, age, and brain dominance.<br><br> A total of 60 students were randomly chosen to participate ranging from elementary to high school. All participants filled out an agreement, which disqualified those who are colorblind. Participants were asked to take a left/right brain dominance survey to identify their brain dominance prior to the study. <br><br> Overall, statistical analysis indicated a significant difference in word distortion levels compared with the identified effect. Each level progressively decreased p-values as words became more distorted. All p-values were well below the 0.05 alpha level, which means there was a significant difference between each level and the Stroop Effect.<br><br> Male vs. Female, statistics showed that there was a significance difference (p<0.05) in levels 2-6 except level 4. Females had faster times than males with the largest difference observed in level 2.<br><br> Age difference, p-values indicated there was no significance difference throughout all levels of distortion amongst elementary through high school age groups except level 2. High school students responded faster than the other two groups in that level.<br><br> Brain dominance, analysis showed p-values (p<0.05) in all levels. The null hypothesis could not be rejected. Collected data showed no evidence of a significant difference between brain dominance.

A SURVEY-BASED STUDY TO DETERMINE THE PREFERENCES OF WEB-USERS VIA UNIQUE VISUAL EVALUATION ASPECTS
Omar Abdulrahman Alhadlaq
Al Manarat Schools, Riyadh, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Research reveals that website design preferences depend on culture, education level, age and gender. Companies and web-developers are interested in designing websites that are focused on target constituents since they must generate a positive first impression that influences website credibility. The purpose of this project is to determine if culture has more effect on the web preferences of the users than gender and to assess visual inclinations. Websites designs are governed visually by five distinct aspects; colorfulness, information density, images, saturation and structure. This web-based survey asks the user to review three website designs of these aspects in different levels: low, medium and high, a total of 24 times. The preference forms were completed by 211 individuals from the Middle East (Saudi Arabia), Europe (Spain), Asia (China) and North America (United States). Final data exhibits the preferences of web-users regarding their culture or gender. In terms of colorfulness, images, saturation and structure; the culture factor has greater influence on the preferences than the gender factor. Statistically, the hypothesis was proved for colorfulness, images and saturation with significant p-values of 0.009, 0.001 and 0.028. It was rejected for structure with non-significant p-value of 0.069. The hypothesis was rejected on information density for gender preferences over cultural by p-value of 0.007. These conclusions, in conjunction with visual inclination assessments, can lead to viable applications by web-developers and companies to increase their presence and marketing effectiveness in regions around the world.

AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE TEXTUAL READING ABILITY OF THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Abdullah Abdulfatah Mashat
Ain Jalout Secondary School, Makkah, SAUDI ARABIA

Reading has become one the most fundamental ways of communication and knowledge transfer among people of different races and ages. However, reading depends mainly on the power of sight. Accordingly, for more than a century, the visually impaired have used Braille which depends on the sense of touch. Although Braille has been highly successful, it has limitations: cost, size and Braille book availability. Thus, it is essential to create a new method that takes advantage of the ongoing technological upheaval.<br><br> The objective of this study is to find a new way for visually impaired to read regular books. The research ends up with the invention of a device called EyeFinger .This was tested on 18 visually impaired participants who were instructed on how to use the EyeFinger. Then, they scanned random letters and numbers and said them. They repeated this at least 10 times with the result of 97% accuracy in recognizing letters and numbers. Then, they took a survey to assess the benefits of the EyeFinger, which showed how the device is user friendly and has improved the reading ability of the impaired. Hence, e-Books have become accessible for the visually impaired and this has positively affected their quality of life. <br><br> The conclusion is that this innovative device, EyeFinger, can lead to viable production system that will give the visually impaired the opportunity to read books and improve their quality of life. In the future, this can be enhanced to include image recognition through the same device.

THE EFFECT OF NORMAL FREQUENCY HEARTBEATS ON IMPROVING VISUAL COMMUNICATION FOR YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM
Lujain Abdulghaffar Aljawi
Ibda'a School, Jeddah, Western, SAUDI ARABIA

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often have difficulties in communicating, especially with eye contact. This makes understanding and talking to them more challenging. Recent investigations on non-autistic patients have suggested that heartbeat frequency sensing can increase the sense of intimacy. The research aims to explore this method for improving the level of eye contact in individuals with ASD. During this inquiry, a recording of heartbeats, in mid frequencies, was administered to a sample of 60 individuals with ASD, ages between 5 -16 years. The effect of these normal frequency heartbeats on visual performance was investigated by conducting a comparison between factors which measure levels of eye contact before listening to the heartbeats (group1) and while listening to it (group2) using headphones. The hypothesis was supported as it was found that listening to heartbeats increases visual contact of autistic children in communication. Results by reference to group A indicated that the duration of visual contact increased after listening to the heartbeat in a positive manner by more than 300%,the stability of visual contact increased by 75%, the focus level of visual contact increased by 59%, followed by a steady look when pointing at an object increase of 81%. Applications of this research include the designs of interactive video games that integrate heartbeat sound or tangible interaction ,and toys such as a teddy bear with sensors to achieve intimacy when being cuddled. This will help children with ASD communicate better and improve their quality of life.

THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIC LABELING ON TASTE PERCEPTION
Sydney Grace Hutton
James Bowie High School, Austin, Texas, TX

This study examines taste perceptions of organically produced foods to determine whether organic labeling influences people to perceive something as better tasting than its non-organic counterpart. Most Americans believe organic food is better tasting than conventionally produced food (Bittman, 2009). Jenny Wan-Chen Lee attributes this labeling preference to the Halo Effect, or “the perception of one trait influencing the perceptions of other traits in an object.” (Lee, 2010) Participants engaged in four trials of orange juice tasting and recorded their preferences as “organic”, “non-organic “or “no preference”. 25 participants were tested. In Trial 1, the participants tasted organic and non-organic juice, labeled “1” and “2” to obtain initial taste preference. Trials 2 and 3 were placebo trials, with identical juice samples labeled as “organic” and “non-organic” respectively. Trial 4 presented organic and non-organic juice labeled accurately. In Trial 1, the participants preferred the taste of organic juice. The placebo trials indicated a preference for organic over non-organic labeled juice, showing labeling influence. The organically labeled juice was preferred in all trials. The no preference option was rarely chosen, indicating that labeling affected the majority of the participants. The results show that labeling a food organic causes people to believe it is better tasting than a food labeled non-organic. For consumers, this experiment may assist in overcoming taste perception labeling bias. The food industry may utilize this study to encourage greater organic production and labeling to increase sales.

CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR AND GENETICS OF HEADPLUGGING IN C. ELEGANS
Mimi Yen
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Variation is the fundamental unit of evolution. Headplugging behavior, a phenotypic polymorphism observed in an Australian wild isolate strain of C. elegans, is a model of maladaptive behavioral variation resulting from hermaphroditic evolution. Isolation from hermaphrodites will cause males in dense populations to deposit plugs on one another’s excretory pores (a trait termed “headplugging”). The chemical and physical causation of the behavior was tested through assays screening for the effect of hermaphroditic secretions and presence of vulvaless hermaphrodites on headplugging frequency. Headplugging rates may be reduced by ~10% by introducing hermaphroditic secretions to the environment, suggesting a chemical trigger for the trait. Detrimental reproductive consequences of the trait were tested using assays surveying the effect of headplugs on mating success: mating capabilities of plugged males did not differ significantly from those of WT males (X2=0.1476, p = 0.701). QTL mapping narrowed down the locus containing the putative allele to a region approximately 0.6 Mb in length left of 4.399 Mb on chromosome II. Behavioral investigations of this highly visible phenotype may shed light on the relationship between environmental and genetic factors that contribute to variation.

A BIG FAT DEAL, PHASE III: ATTRIBUTIONS OF BODY TALK, RISK ASSESSMENTS OF STEROID/DIETARY SUPPLEMENT USE, PERCEPTIONS OF MEDIA IMAGES, AND SELF-ESTEEM
L. Elisabeth Burton
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

This year I expanded my study to include males and explored factors associated with attributions of body talk. I propose a new theoretical construct related to the drive for muscularity, Buff Talk.<br><br>My hypothesis was: Adolescents that attribute body talk to internal causes will have lower risk assessments of steroid use and/or dietary supplements, higher perceptions of media ideals as attainable and real, and lower self-esteem. I was unable to find any published studies that explore these relationships.<br><br>I developed and distributed a survey to 100 females and 89 males ranging between 15 to 18 years old. The data was analyzed using Pearson Correlations and a T-Test. <br><br>The results of this study largely supported my hypothesis. For both males and females, internal attributions of body talk was associated with feeling pressure to take steroids, supplements or purge; perceiving media images as attainable, real, and desirable; feeling pressure to look like media images; and had lower self-esteem. Females with internal attributions assessed occasional purging as low risk. When the need to keep competitive in sports was the main attribution, males assessed frequent steroid use as low risk. <br><br>My study suggests that body talk is complex. Adolescents have different reasons for body talk. Adolescents globally are confronted with unrealistically skinny or buff photoshopped media images that are unattainable. When adolescents are preoccupied with their physical selves, they often fail to understand that they are far more than how they look, and waste energy that could be used to reach their full potential.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING POST STROKE RECOVERY
Jessica Sarah Lauren Garrett
Telopea Park School, ACT, AUSTRALIA

This project was undertaken after I observed the colour; pattern and texture of carpets affected the mobility of recovering left hemiplegic stroke patients. It was hypothesized that multicoloured carpets would over load the brain’s capacity to interpret complex visual input for these patients, as brain damage due to strokes, generally destroys the neuron pathways which interpret vision. <br><br>This project was undertaken to test this hypothesis and to increase understanding of this phenomena. A number of recovering left hemiplegic stoke patients and non stroke controls, were selected randomly, and their walking speed and number of steps taken over a 10 metre trial, were measure d on two different types of carpet. The results clearly demonstrated that the carpet design did affect mobility for stroke patients while having no impact on non stroke controls, as was expected. <br><br>Furthermore, many stroke patients reported that they felt confused, dizzy and disoriented on multicoloured carpets, indicating their brains were overwhelmed by the complex visual input that was being interpreted while walking, confirming the hypothesis. <br><br>This finding is important for therapists and others assisting the recovery of stroke patients. This study is also significant as strokes occur all around the word affecting millions of people. The conclusion from this study could aid designers and architects when planning floor coverings for hospitals and other public places.

HUMAN OR DOLL?: ANIMACY'S ROLE IN HUMAN RECOGNITION
Patricia Hanus
Hanus Home School, Fremont, NE

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs social interaction and communication abilities and affects approximately 1:88 Americans. (Baio, 2012) Research indicates that individuals who suffer from autism may perceive human features as inanimate (i.e. doll-like), when an unaffected individual would perceive them as animate.  This study investigates animacy adaption effects using similar faces, dissimilar faces, and cross-species faces.  After filling out a consent and Autism Quotient survey, subjects rated the animacy of faces both before and after adaptation. Additionally, they were tested on biological motion perception, face-car memory, and face and car perception. The current study also investigates if subjects' perception of animacy in faces is related to how well they remember faces and objects, how well they distinguish faces and objects, and how well they can distinguish human motion from scrambled human motion. Hopefully, this study can provide data leading to a better understanding of how humans perceive animacy and the neural underpinnings of disrupted social perception in autism. The results of this study show that animacy is adaptable for similar and dissimilar faces but not for faces that cross the species barrier. A strong correlation was found between animacy ratings and biological motion perception ability, upon further analyses a strong correlation was also found between animacy and age. No correlation was found between animacy ratings and performance on face or object memory and perception tasks.

MENTAL ACTIVITY AND TIME PERCEPTION
Maxwell Dunbar DeKock
Summit High School, Bend, OR

It has been hypothesized that there are two modes of thinking: System 1, which is fast, automatic, and intuitive, and System 2, which is slow, methodical, and sequential. I tested the hypothesis that the use of System 1 would cause time to seem to go by faster than the use of System 2. Forty-three subjects were asked to complete a randomly-generated computer puzzle twice, once without aid to activate System 2, and once with the solution visible to elicit System 1. After playing each game for a set interval, the subjects were asked to guess how long they had been playing. Additionally, their heart rate was measured. Half the subjects were given the System 1 game first, and the other half were given the System 2 game first. When subjects were using System 1, their average time estimation error was 54.7%, which was significantly higher than 31.6%, the average error using System 2 (Single-factor ANOVA, p=0.0057). The order that the games were presented in was found to have no significant impact on retrospective time estimation accuracy (Single-factor ANOVA, p=0.2393). Also, heart rate was not affected by which game was being played (Single-factor ANOVA, p=0.969).

BRAIN PLASTICITY: THE EFFECT OF AGE (A THREE YEAR STUDY)
Olivia Albin Dure
Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

The objective of this experiment was to determine if a correlation exists between age-related differences in plasticity and executive function. In this experiment subjects threw unmarked balls 20 times at a target (Test I). They repeat the throws after putting on Delta25 prism goggles(Test II). The subjects then remove the prism goggles and throw 20 more times (Test III). Throughout this process, the subject remains seated in a chair eight feet away from the target. To assess executive functions in these groups, the Stroop test and the Trails test were administered. The Stroop test examines directed attention, while the Trails test assesses task-switching. The Stroop test has three parts, colors, words, and words written in colors. The subject has 45 seconds to read aloud as many as they can for each part. Scores are recorded by counting the number of colors, words, or colored words read aloud in each trial. The Trails test has two parts, the first with encircled numbers distributed across a page, and the second with encircled numbers and letters. The subject connects the circles numerically for Test A and then alternates numbers and letters in ascending order in Test B. Analysis of the visual-motor task once again demonstrates a difference in readaptation of the two age groups in Test III. The Trails test results show a statistical difference between the age groups, suggesting a correlation between the abilities of the age groups in the visual-motor task and the executive function of task switching. The interference score calculated from the Stroop test shows no statistical difference between the groups. These results show not only that plasticity and some executive functions vary with age, but also that plasticity correlates to specific executive function development.

QUANTIFYING IMPLICIT STEREOTYPES THROUGH THE COGNITION OF AMBIGUOUS SPEECH ASSOCIATED WITH VISUAL MEANINGS
Nicholas Joseph Corpuz
Academy for Math Engineering and Science, Murray, UT

Unlike many creatures verbal language is our species most basic form of communication. The ability to verbally exchange information and have what you articulate be fully understood is a fundamental component of our lives and directly impacts almost every social interaction. Recent studies have shed light on the brains astonishing ability to predetermine a person’s sex, age, and race through incredibly minute variations in speech timing, tone, and pronunciation. Unfortunately, this reflexive ability all too often culminates in what is called linguistic profiling, or the subconscious profiling of an individual based off of these small elements in speech which are often collectively perceived as an accent. Countless cases of minorities being denied loans, apartments, and job interviews because attributed to speculated prejudices formed simply by “ethnic” sounding voices. Thusly, it is imperative that the impact of implicit stereotyping in speech and its subsequent effect on the mind is understood, so that it may be combated. <br><br>This study sought to determine how linguistic profiling influences the minds perceived ability to understand a speaker. Moreover, if an ambiguous computer generated speech sample, devoid of racially differentiating factors, would be perceived differently simply because it was associated with contextually significant images. Tests indicate that comprehension of the sample was very dependent upon the subjects race. <br><br>Variables are believed to makeup a hierarchy of effects, wherein accuracy is most affected by factors such as race and home language, whereafter factors such as age, and parental education take effect.

FACE OFF: A COMPARISON OF THE PERCEPTION OF NEURO-TYPICAL AND AUTISTIC INDIVIDUAL WHEN DETERMINING FACIAL EMOTION
Mattlyn Reed Dragoo
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

The purpose of this project was to determine the strategies used by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neuro-typical (NT) individuals to determine emotions in faces, and whether those subjects prefer moderate or exaggerated levels of emotion. Due to the mouth’s obvious and varied movements, I hypothesized that if subjects are exposed to numerous depictions of standard emotions, and are asked to select the picture that appears to look the most realistic from a pair, then those with ASD will be more likely to choose the exaggerated facial expressions. If subjects are exposed to numerous pictures incorporating a mixture of two different facial expressions, then both groups will be more likely to reply on the lower part of the face, as opposed to the upper, for their selection.<br><br> Subjects were given tests that would determine the approach they took when deciding on facial emotions. The results of these tests were then used to further analyze the tactics NT and ASD individuals use to perceive emotions. A large percentage (85%) of the people with Autism Spectrum Disorder tended to choose exaggerated facial expressions, while neuro-typical individuals scored roughly equally across the board. There was no noticeably significant difference in the strategy (upper/lower face) used by neuro-typical subjects for determining facial expressions. However, subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder tended to rely more heavily on the lower half of the face.

INVESTIGATING THE USE OF HOLISTIC COMPUTER GAMES AND HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE IN MUSIC EDUCATION: A NOVEL APPROACH TO PITCH INSTRUCTION
Victoria Rose Robinson
Camdenton High School, Camdenton, MO

Hemispheric dominance is generally not observed in the classroom. Most teaching methods do not effectively teach students with right-brain tendencies. As a result, the left-brain students experience greater success, while their right-brain peers fall behind (Gould, 2009). Even in the elementary music classroom, right-brain students may not be addressed to the extent necessary to encourage equal learning.<br><br> Computer games can be beneficial to right-brain students because they encourage right hemisphere usage (Lin FL et al, 2010). Because right-brain students tend to think on a more holistic level, the computer game designed for this experiment was programmed by an independent consultant with specifications so as to address this aspect. Students were given tests to approximate their hemispheric tendencies as well as their abilities to match pitch. Following these tests, the control group remained in the classroom to be taught using traditional methods, while the experimental group played the holistic computer game. After the students’ differing lessons, the vocal match test was again administered to determine the amount of improvement.<br><br> The right-brain students in the experimental group responded more positively to the holistic computer game. It was shown, overall, that the holistic computer game caused a greater amount of improvement for most of the subdivisions within the experimental group. Left-brain students and students with visual tendencies, however, did not respond as hypothesized. The students with auditory tendencies in the control group made greater improvement than the students with visual tendencies. Further research may reveal new alternative teaching methods that promote holistic learning. These methods may be implemented on a much larger scale.

GUANXI: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS IN CHINESE BUSINESS
Alex Bergsaaker
Tryggheim Vidaregaaende Skule, Naerbo, Rogaland, NORWAY

This thesis is a social anthropological study of the importance of Guanxi, i.e. relations and social networks, in Chinese business. The research will endeavor to describe and explain the mechanisms involved in Guanxi. It raises the following questions: <br><br>1. What role does Guanxi play in the business world in China?<br><br>2. How are relations built?<br><br>3. Why is Guanxi predominant in the China’s business culture?<br><br>The author attempts to achieve a holistic understanding of people, culture and society by means of detailed studies and comparisons of local life. Fieldwork consisting observations and interviews are the most important sources of research data. <br><br>Having a large and influential social network - good Guanxi, in other words - is decisive in Chinese business culture. Good Guanxi is a prerequisite for all business dealings in a completely different way than in the west. It can also be used to achieve benefits and to solve conflicts in other contexts. The most important way of building Guanxi is through business meals, which are very unusual in that they are organized on the basis of a specific social situation, they have a specific purpose and follow specific rules. Mianzi (face) functions as a means of controlling the allocation of resources, while at the same time helping to build relations. The great importance of Guanxi can be explained by a combination of how society is organised and the Chinese mentality.

SOCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR WOMEN, ANALYZING LIEBOWITZ SOCIAL ANXIETY SCALE FOR A TRAINING PROPOSAL IN MICROFINANCE
Magdaly Esther Santillanez Olivas
COBAES 21, Dr. Genaro Salazar Cuellar, Guamuchil, Salvador Alvarado, Sinaloa, MEXICO

In Mexico exists 52 million of poor people, despite the implementation of Social Programs and Microcredits. Economic growth, by reducing poverty and increasing opportunity for empowerment, can have a positive impact on gender equality and economic development (Esther Duflo, et al., 2011), however poor women desert from social assistance programs for multiple reasons: sexism, illiteracy, and other situations. Can these characteristics, produce high social anxiety to generate low social inclusion results?<br><br>This study takes place in Sinaloa State, Mexico, in the county of Salvador Alvarado. The objective is to analyze through Scale of Liebowitz in social anxiety, how the treatment received in the context can affect poor women behavior and create a training to reduce these effects.<br><br>The study is based on a first survey of Modus Vivendi and three different samples in social anxiety, targeting women from a government social assistance program. Sample 1: 18 surveys, participants presented difficulties to understand situations described in it, thus, in order to reduce risk, the survey is simplified in colloquial language, with examples and an easier manner to answer. Sample 2: same amount of people to compare results between both surveys. Sample 3: 100 women per every urban and rural area, a total of 200 participants, corresponding to the full attendance of the program. I analyzed the question-behavior effects presented, as well as the topics where people had higher anxiety rates, to create the proposal, which can be applied along with a microfinance program to empower poor women and generate social inclusion.

A SUPERIOR BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE PARADIGM FOR COMMUNICATION IN NORMAL AND APHASIC STROKE PATIENTS
Kevin Daniel Shih, Ryan Matthew Shih, 
Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, FL

The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) visual speller is a revolutionary technology that allows people to spell purely with their brainwaves. This Year II project compared subject performance using the Checkerboard-Paradigm (CBP) and the Row-Column-Paradigm (RCP). The hypothesis was that the CBP (newly developed method) would be more efficient (faster / more accurate) than the RCP (traditional method) for both normal subjects and aphasic stroke patients. <br><br> Twenty normals and nine aphasic stroke patients attempted to spell 44 different target selections with each paradigm. Brainwaves were acquired using a 32-electrode EEG cap and analyzed by standard laptop computers running BCI2000 software. A classifier program determined user intent and produced output commands in the form of letters on a computer monitor. Flash number, session time, accuracy, paradigm preference, and visual-analogue-scores of paradigm difficulty were recorded.<br><br> For normal subjects, 10 flashes were needed for CBP and 12 for RCP (p<0.05; paired T-test). Spelling time for CBP sessions was longer than RCP (p<0.005). Subjects accuracy was 93% using CBP and 82% using RCP (p<0.01). Seventeen of 20 subjects preferred the CBP (p<0.0001). Visual-analogue-scales showed CBP was easier than RCP (p<0.0001). Normal subjects achieved a higher accuracy compared to stroke subjects in both CBP (p<0.0001; T-test) and RCP (p=0.01). <br><br> The CBP is a superior visual speller paradigm compared to RCP, based on spelling accuracy and subject preference. We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that aphasic stroke patients can use BCI visual spellers; we further recommend that the CBP be used in subsequent BCI research.

SEXISM IN PUBLICITY. ARE WE AWARE OF THAT?
Maria Dominzain, Alejandro Ginares, 
Instituto Habilitado Galileo Galilei, Piriapolis, Maldonado, URUGUAY

Sexism can be seen in everyday life because it has been part of society since ancient times, creating, as a consequence, unequal stereotypes for each of the sexes. Although these stereotypes have changed along history, they are still present and, does publicity use them? Here lies the issue that this research tries to solve, the question is: Are we aware of what publicity shows us? The hypothesis expresses that actual publicity often contains sexist messages which are unconsciously internalized by local teenagers therefore promulgating sexism in our society.<br><br>Gender stereotypes internalized by teenagers were identified by an observed participation in a students' debate about masculinity and feminity. Social Semiotics was studied to understand the mechanism of advertising. A study among 50 teenagers was conducted to know whether they can identify sexist messages and judge them. A poll was carried out to determine if people is aware of the sexist content of the publicity and its consequences. The research was complemented by bibliography analysis and three interviews with workers of areas related to the project.<br><br>According to the study teenagers from 12 to 14 years old are more prone to internalize sexist messages than the older ones. The poll shows differences between men and women in the awareness of the publicity consequences for themselves.<br><br>The hypothesis was demonstrated and this project proves the importance of struggling against sexism and the influence of publicity in teenagers. Related to this there have been given lectures on the topic to more than 300 people.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF VISUAL SELF-RECOGNITION IN TODDLERS THROUGH MIRROR REFLECTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
Laura Sylvia Landgraf, Margaret Mary Green, 
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, MN

This study examines the development of visual self-recognition in toddlers (aged twelve to thirty months) by testing their ability to recognize themselves in mirror reflections and photographs. Psychologists in the past have independently assessed children’s abilities to self-recognize through both mirror and photograph tests, but these two measurements of recognition have never been tested in conjunction. It was hypothesized that when a mirror test and a two part photograph test (a headshot and then a headshot with a change in everyday appearance) were performed on the toddlers, the toddlers would be most successful in completing the mirror test and least successful in completing the photo identification test involving the appearance change. It was also hypothesized that before seventeen months, not one of the children would be able to pass any of the three tests, but by the age of thirty months all children would successfully pass all three of the tests. To test this hypothesis the three tests were performed on a group of sixty-two toddlers and their success at self-identification was recorded. The statistical analyses of an ANOVA and a Cochran’s Q were performed on the data which solidified that the mirror test was indeed most successful while the photo test including the change had the lowest rate of success among the toddlers. Before the age of sixteen months, zero percent of children could pass any of the tests, but by the age of twenty-nine months there was a one hundred percent success rate on all three tests.

DOES THE APPLE FALL FAR FROM THE TREE?: THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL THINKING
Erin Elizabeth Farmer, Kate Campbell Woolverton, 
Haas Hall Academy, Fayetteville, AR

The upcoming presidential election piqued interest in the development of political thinking in children. This study examines the influence parents’ political thinking has on their children. The hypotheses for this experiment are that children’s perception of their parents’ political views influence their childrens’ thinking and, as children grow up, sources that influence the childrens’ political thinking become more varied. To test these hypotheses, 363 subjects aged 9-27 were surveyed about their political thinking. <br><br> The data suggested that the importance that children place on politics is similar to the importance they believe their parents place on politics. Of the subjects who reported that politics were extremely important, 70% stated that their fathers thought politics were important, and 54% stated that their mothers thought politics were important. <br><br> The results also suggested that parents were the most prominent influence on the child’s political thinking. However, with age, the most influential persons expanded to include others. In the youngest group, 5% cited a person other than a parent as most influential, whereas in the oldest group, over 25% chose "Other" as most influential. Despite outside influences, parents remain influential throughout all age categories, perhaps because political discussions in the home increased with age. <br><br> Parental influence also affects future predicted voting behavior: 75% of subjects agreed with their mothers' perceived political party affiliation (PPPA), while 71% agreed with their fathers' PPPA. All age groups identified important political issues, although understanding of issues increased with age.

THE EFFECT OF AGE ON THE "HASTY GLANCE" METHOD OF ELICITING DEJA VU
Duncan Joseph Prince, Caleb Archuleta, 
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

Briefly glancing at an unfamiliar symbol can make it appear strangely familiar when fully processed moments later. This “hasty glance” method is the universally accepted way to experimentally induce a false recognition (déjà vu). One of the most consistent findings from the déjà vu literature is that reported incidence and frequency decline with age. This study investigated the effect of age on déjà vu occurrences under controlled conditions, using a brief prime shown before test symbols to simulate a hasty glance. Deja vu occurrences were measured in two ways: elicited deja vu (a yes judgment identifying a novel stimulus as familiar when preceded by an identical prime),and natural deja vu (a yes judgment to a deja vu state during the experiment). The hypothesis was that high school students (<19 yrs) will experience more deja vu sensations than teachers (>25 yrs). Seventeen teachers (mean age 41.2 years) and 22 students (mean age 16.0 years) were randomly selected and tested at school to control for education level and setting. Over 114 sequentially randomized critical trials, participants were shown novel, high- and low-familiarity symbols on a computer screen, each preceded by a brief (35-msec)prime of the test symbol(identical), a different symbol, or no prime. Results supported the hypothesis in two ways. Students had more elicited deja vu occurrences than teachers: using the Mann-Whitney U test, the difference in yes judgments to identical prime novel symbols approached statistical significance (p=0.0595). Students had more natural deja vu occurrences than teachers: 82% of students compared to 20% of teachers reported a deja vu state. This research is among the first to demonstrate differences in both elicited and natural deja vu occurrences with age.

COLLECTIVE FOOD RITUALS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON SOCIAL RELATIONS: A CASE STUDY INVOLVING HOMELESS PEOPLE
Flavia Araujo de Amorim, Thais May Carvalho, Julia Generoso Gonzales
Colegio Giordano Bruno, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

In Brazil there is a contingent estimated at 31922 homeless people and in this situation those people face the loss of their social and affective ties. To deal with this problem, in our research we investigated the effectiveness of the use of collective food rituals as a strategy in the resocialization of people in this condition. To do so, we promoted 11 collective food rituals with a group of 23 homeless people in a shelter. Through the concept of Social Support, we applied questionnaires to measure the development of the perception of affection, obtaining changes of 69.2% in the friendship variable and 61.5% in intimacy one. Student’s T-test for paired means provided a confidence of 95% and 99% respectively, attesting that the changes happened due to our intervention. Another perspective of analysis used was the qualitative one through interviews with participants and also the study of the visual records of the rituals. The comparison of these data with the quantitative results allowed us to say that we went beyond our hypothesis, since individuals not only established affective ties with each other but also revalued themselves as unique individuals with their own identity. The great results demonstrate the efficiency of the method used in this research, suggesting its applicability in different environments, such as hospitals and asylums, where there are groups of people who perceive themselves as disconnected from their closest social circle and without affective support.

THE RUBIK'S CUBE OF POLITICAL GRIDLOCK: RESISTANCE TO CHANGE IN THE AMERICAN TAX SYSTEM
Braeden Thomas Horton, Brydie Mitchell, Elizabeth Wood, 
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

The researchers were interested in the psychology involved in selecting taxation methods (Flat, Fair, and Progressive) and the relationships to the public’s resistance to change. Five Hundred Surveys were sent to randomly assigned citizens in Delta County, Colorado. Questions one through seventeen pertained to questions related to the subjects’ resistance to change. Each question was tallied from the 84 subjects’ responses for each question. Correlations were run to examine relationships between survey questions as well as relationships between the resistance to change (or lack of resistance to change) and the three taxation methods. There appears to be little relationship between low perceived levels of resistance to change and dis-liking our current tax system (R=0.088 and ANOVA: p=0.427). In general the public appears to be fed up with our method of taxation. However, it seems not to be correlated to Oreg’s resistance to change mode.

IS MATERNITY IN ADOLESCENTS A FACTOR THAT INFLUENCES POVERTY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS POPULAR 1 AND 2 OF THE CITY OF MEDELLIN?
Yessica Marcela Borja, Geraldin Vasquez, 
Institucion Educativa Federico Carrasquilla, Medellin, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

Our research project originated in the following hypothesis: Is maternity in adolescents a factor that influences poverty in the neighbourhoods Popular 1 and 2 of the city of Medellin? As part of the methodology a survey is carried out, taking as units of analysis 20 teenage mothers who live in the relevant neighbourhoods of the Comune #1 of Medellin, a peripheral zone affected by violence where a large number of displaced communities live together. Of this sample we took two teenagers to carry out deeper fieldwork making use of ethnographic techniques. We narrate, through chronicles, life-stories that illustrate very well this phenomenon of which there aren´t many studies and which affects whole families, where women still carry the entire economic, emotional and affective load.<br><br>Teenage motherhood, occurring in the particular conditions of our neighbourhood does dramatically restrict the access to opportunities in education, mobility, health, employment, leisure and socialisation. Of the 20% of surveyed mothers, 15 (75%) dedicate their time, exclusively, to look after their children.<br><br>The current teenager generation is the largest recorded in the history of mankind, and 85% of this lives in developing countries. Teenage fertility is higher in least-favoured communities. This is a situation that originates in a specific local context but has global implications, affecting public and private spheres such as religious, political, social, economical, ethical, gender-related and with a strong cultural background.

LIAR LIAR FACE ON FIRE: THE EFFECTS OF NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ON NUCHAL TEMPERATURE
Daniel Steven Long, Marissa Rademaker, 
Delavan High School, Delavan, IL

Lie detection, a controversial practice in the scientific community, has been dominated by use of the polygraph. Thermal imaging technology, a non-invasive method, has been the subject of recent studies worldwide in detecting dishonesty. Recent data shows that thermal imagers can surpass a polygraph in lie detection. This project’s purpose was to determine whether variations in nuchal temperature could be used as a predictor of lying. The experimenters developed ten questions, selected ten subjects, and constructed lie cards. Each subject entered the controlled testing room and received a randomly selected card. Using a thermal imager, the subjects’ nuchal temperatures were recorded before, during, and after responding to each question in the three trials. Data showed a slight rise in nuchal temperatures over seventy percent of the time as the subjects answered the untruthful questions. Conversely, nuchal temperatures remained constant through eighty percent of the truthfully answered questions. A bell-shaped curve was created to support data reliability, and 83.3% of the temperature values fell within one standard deviation of the mean. In conclusion, the hypothesis that nuchal temperature would be affected by lying was supported. To extend the project, additional readings in the facial area would be obtained, and a larger sample size would be tested; thus, a greater understanding and conclusion to the effect of lying on body temperature as a whole could be achieved. Furthermore, with its sustained reliability in detecting lies and non-invasive process, thermal imaging devices are more practical than polygraphs and have a desired capability for use in highly crowded areas such as airports.

MAKING PAPER FROM NATURAL FIBERS: RECYCLING AND REUSING AT SCHOOL II
Antonia Amanda Araujo, Socorro Magarete Oliveira, 
Escola de Ensino Médio Professora Theolina de Muryllo Zacas, Bela Cruz, CE, BRASIL

The research about environmental issues has assumed a position of prominence in the last few decades. The growing concern about ecological degradation associated to the continued loss of natural resources, are considered key elements capable of directing the actions of man, who is, theoretically, the agent able to intervene in the environment. One of the most important problems we face is the waste production which is being widely discussed, not only by cost-benefit analysts, but also by a growing number of life cycle assessments (LCA) concerned to execute the three “R” sustainable actions: to reduce, to recycle and to reuse. In this project, we investigate the recycling process of wasted natural fibers into paper, as a way to preserve and promote sustainability aiming different areas of our society such as in social, education and business. The first stage of our work consisted in a bibliographical review which was the base for the lectures we promoted in partnership with public and private companies, community associations and schools in the city of Bela Cruz – CE, Brazil. In the second stage we produced paper based on recycling banana (Musa ssp.) and coconut (Cocus sp.) trees’ fiber. In this stage we used an environmental educational kit available in our school. The results of the lectures showed an increase in the environmental perception and also a change in environmental behavior not only in the school but in all the community. The paper production had an important impact in the economy of the schools, reducing the costs of paper acquisition.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP HYGIENE AND ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER
Anne Kathryn Gilbert, Kara Gilbert, 
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, OR

Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and poor sleep hygiene are two common problems in the lives of many teenagers. This study explores the possibility of the misdiagnosis of ADD when poor sleep hygiene could be a contributing factor. Many teenagers are being diagnosed with ADD, but the exact number of actual cases is unknown. The hypothesis explored in this study is that students with poor quality of sleep will show symptoms similar to Attention Deficit Disorder because sleep affects attention and concentration. <br><br>A survey was designed containing questions about sleep quality and academics, along with concentration level and other ADD symptoms taken from an actual ADD diagnostic test. This survey was given to numerous freshman biology classes and a few chemistry classes. Chi-square tests were performed on a variety of different pairs of questions, mainly relating to sleep quality and ADD symptoms. Some of the data supported the hypothesis by showing a relationship between poor sleep hygiene and symptoms characteristics of ADD. <br><br>In conclusion, by giving a survey containing questions about sleep quality and ADD symptoms, it was found that teenagers with poor sleep quality report more ADD symptoms than others. Given the apparent overlap between ADD symptoms and the effects of poor sleep hygiene, there may be a risk of misdiagnosis leading to unnecessary treatment with medication.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPACT FORCE, NECK STRENGTH AND NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN SOCCER HEADING
Catherine Marie Conte, Adam Illowsky, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Head impacts are common in contact sports, but only recently has there been a rising awareness of the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (ie., concussions). Research has noted that in some sports such as basketball, soccer and lacrosse; women suffer more concussions than men. In soccer, “heading” is an integral part of game play, but effectively constitutes subconcussive impacts. Recent work suggests there is no short term effect of heading on neurocognitive performance, but over the course of a career, these impacts may “add up”. However, there is little work evaluating what factors may be related to the amount of impact sustained from a header. This study tested thirty adolescent female soccer players recruited from a local high school varsity team. Prior to testing, subjects completed the ImPACT neurocognitive test, as well as tests of neck strength (flexion, extension, and lateral flexion). They were then outfitted with a custom headgear that allowed for accurate affixation of an accelerometer to the back of the skull to measure the impact of the ball on the head. Participants performed a series of “header drills”, then completed the ImPACT test once again. Results indicated that there was a moderate negative correlation between neck strength and head acceleration, indicating those with weaker necks had greater accelerations/impact. ImPACT test results indicated that participants actually improved in their post test scores, which was attributed to a learning effect. The results of this study will be used to increase public awareness about the relationship between neck strength and heading impact and helps fill the gap in literature regarding how to minimize of subconcussive impacts on female soccer players. The current study also contributes novel software and headgear to be used for similar future studies.

EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN ADOLESCENT MALES
Logan Thomas Dirks, Aaron Matthew Borton, 
Delavan High School, Delavan, IL

The purpose of the project was to compare the effects of twenty-four, thirty-six and forty-eight hours of total sleep deprivation as compared to a full nights sleep. <br><br>The hypothesis was that sleep deprivation would have a sufficient effect on cognitive and physiological functions as compared to a control of a full night of sleep. <br><br>Ten subjects came to the testing area at 10:00 P.M and go to sleep at 10:30 P.M. Subjects were woken up at 7:00 A.M and given breakfast. At 8:00 A.M each subject played the game operation, then given a quiz and memory test.Next the performed a cardio test consisting of a five minute jog after which each subjects heart rate was recorded. Then the subjects performed a strength test in which each subject did as many push ups as possible. They also completed a balance test which had the subjects walk toe-to-toe on a straight fifty foot line and finally they played catch with a foam football.<br><br>Throughout the test results were recorded from each test based on how the subjects performed compared to their results from the control. Irritability and fatigue became noticeable at the twenty-four hour testing and continued to grow throughout the rest of the experiment.<br><br>Although side effects such as irritability, fatigue and a lack of concentration were present, the results concluded that forty-eight hours of sleep deprivation does not have a significant effect on cognitive and physiological functions. Results did conclude that there is a minor effect on these functions and that there are other effects which mostly effect attitude and personality.

PHONOLOGICAL SKILLS IN PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN, AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY
Joana Nunes, Ricardo Nogueira, Teresa Costa
Colegio Luso-Frances, Porto, PORTUGAL

The project "Palavrar” main goal was to diagnose the phonological skills of a target group of students from pre-school in transition for the Primary School at Luso-Francês School.<br><br>Research indicates that the better the students’ phonological skills, the better their education success on the whole school curriculum. In the learning process of reading and writing (literacy) there are involved - among other phonological skills that the child has - technical knowledge about reading / writing. However, these capabilities are not equally developed for all children. We know, however, that their skills can be encouraged and promoted early to improve later school success. Watching a discrepancy in access by children, these same impulses are important, such as the availability of parents on the relationship and education the children, the early entry into kindergarten and affordability for the acquisition of equipment for playing.<br><br>We decided to conduct a case study in order to i) evaluate the knowledge of reading / writing or designs on early the same as a target group of children from pre-school, applying a diagnostic test; ii) undertake promotional activities of the same capabilities; iii) reassess the ability of children to study to verify the effectiveness of the intervention performed.<br><br>From the results, it was found that the stimuli used had a positive effect in promoting phonological group powers, which work will be continued for the Psychology of the College in subsequent years, in order to extend this strategy throughout the pre-school, together with the teachers of the institution.

BEAUTIFUL BRAINS: A COMPARISON BETWEEN RISK-TAKING ADOLESCENTS AND SUCCESSFUL ADULTS
Rochelle Amanda Rivera-Leal, Jose Ramirez, 
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Adolescents are a model of the sustainability of our human resources. Objectives: Relate core-values, attitudes and perceptions toward risk between successful adults and adolescents. Estimate the tendency of adolescents becoming successful adults. Methods: A template was designed based on National Geographic’s article “Beautiful Brains”. An open question survey was validated to design a yes/no questionnaire. The convenient sample population consisted of adolescents of ages 14-18 (n=53) from public and private schools and successful adults of 28-66 (n=49) in a pair match design. The distribution by gender was 57.8% female, and 42.2% male. Chi-square was used to compare attitudes, perceptions and core-values between adults and adolescents. Results: Core-values variables including love p < .001, respect, changing society and the importance of spirituality were statistically significant p < .05. Perception variables including decision-making p < .001, perception towards risk and perception towards success were significant p < .05. Attitudes towards goals p < .001, including developing your potential and discovering what obstacles block way for the achievement of your goals were significant p < .05. Conclusion: Aside those differences adolescents core values, perception and attitude towards risk was related to success in adulthood. Adolescents have a tendency to change their core values, perceptions and attitudes as they mature, this agrees with the “Beautiful Brains” article from the National Geographic which states that viewed through the eyes of evolution, adolescents most exasperating traits may be the key to success as adults. <br><br>

GENERATION "WE" AND THE VIDEO GAMES
Nancy Jazmin Perez, ,, 
CBT No 2 Cuautitlan, Cuautitlan, Estado de Mexico, MEXICO

The Generation “We” is a sector of children that were born in homes where technology is in daily activities. Virtual playing is the favorite form of entertainment for this generation, but parents have criticized in negative form the game considering videogames generate violence, antisocial behavior, poor school performance and lead to gambling addiction. We reviewed studies have been conducted on the effects of video games on children and has not found conclusive evidence that pose a public health risk. The objective of this research was to assess the opinion that parents have about the use of video games on children. We worked with a representative sample of parents of private schools in México. Parents were given an informative talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using this entertainment and assess their views before and after conversation. In this investigation it was found than when parents know the scientific evidence of benefits and risks of using video games, they perform an objective assessment on this entertainment and allows an objective assessment is made to make assertive decisions about what to do with virtual entertainment of children.

"BUILDING BRIDGES": EXPANDING THE TEACHERS' HORIZON REGARDING MENTAL ILLNESSES IN STUDENTS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BETTER SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT
Bianca Spina Papaleo
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

30% of SAo Paulo’s population has some kind of mental disease; many of these diseases, such as Depression, Distimic Disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Bipolarity, Conduct Disorder, Substance Abuse, Anxiety Disorder, Schizophrenia and Anorexia or Bulimia have their start in child and teenage hood. According to Bilyk, 12.5% of SAo Paulo’s children from 7 to 14 years old have some kind of mental illness, which means that the prevention and treatment of these diseases is paramount. Teenagers with mental diseases have difficulties in learning and in life as a whole, sometimes because of the lack of preparation their teachers may lack.Thinking of this, I came up with a project to create guidelines and a workshop for the quick identification of these illnesses on the everyday life of my school, organizing a system of prevention. In this system the teachers would identify a student with the possibility of having a mental disorder, warn the counseling team, who would contact the student’s family and, then, suggest the intervention of a specialist. To do so, I created a questionnaire to identify the previous knowledge of the teachers on the topic. Teachers from High School of ColEgio Dante Alighieri were given the questionnaire. The analysis showed that, some illnesses the teachers had more difficulty to identify the diagnostic criteria than of the others. After the analysis, there was a huge workshop with teachers and a specialist, to inform them about mental illnesses and about how important it is for school to work together with psychiatrists and psychologists in order to promote integration in between teacher and students, so these students may have their school environment made better.

EPISODIC AND SEMANTIC MEMORY: IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUNG ADULTS AND SENIORS?
Luzia Stalder
Gymnasium Neufeld, Bern, SWITZERLAND

Older people are expected to show a reduced episodic performance compared to younger people. In contrast, the semantic performance should be similar for both groups.<br><br>To prove the hypothesis a recognition test was adapted and used to compare a younger test group (M= age 20y; n= 13) with an older one (M= age 70y; n= 13). In the test 48 items had to be learned, 24 “reading items”= measurement for semantic memory, 24 had to be acted out, “pantomime items”= measurement for episodic memory. After randomizing the items with 48 similar distracting items, the correct recognition was tested.<br><br>It was shown that the older age group had a lower episodic performance whereas the semantic performance was comparable for both groups. The differences were most striking by the various error frequencies of juniors and seniors. Performance in pantomime-items was significantly better for juniors than for seniors (juniors : seniors false pantomime items M=8% vs M=17%; p=0.002). Performance in reading items was identical for both groups (false reading items juniors M=10% vs seniors M=10%).<br><br>It would be valuable to use this recognition test with different professional categories and groups with different educational levels to find out by which activities the memory performance is influenced. Furthermore, it could be investigated how different trainings improve memory skills. In future, these findings may facilitate studies about learning techniques and technical devices which are especially adapted for older people.

APPLYING MATRIX THEORY TO MODEL GLOBAL SOCIAL DYNAMICS
Heeyoon Kim
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

A matrix-based model was revised from last year to better simulate global social dynamics. It was analyzed to observe changes in dynamics given varying demographic distributions and levels of friendliness (probability range) between cultures. For each trial, demographics were used to generate the sample population. Using the probability range, probabilities (pmn) for connecting each pair of cultures were randomly assigned within the range. For connecting the same culture, the range was assumed to be [0.8, 1). Then, for each pair of people, the probability was used to determine the sign of the relationship value, and multiplied by a random number from [0, 5). For connecting a person to him/herself, the value was randomly generated from [4, 5]. The differential equation dX/dt = X2 was then used to iterate the initial matrix until the network became stable. The log (base 10) was taken for all the matrix entries, since relationships between people logically converge. After developing an algorithm to count the number of cliques, ten trials were run for each variable pairing. The end behavior, size of larger cliques, and time for stabilization were analyzed. The model supported hypotheses for behavior and was thus accurate. Countries with low diversity converged to one clique most of the time for any level of friendliness. Greater pmn values corresponded with greater convergence. High values of pmn lengthened the stabilization period while increasing convergence for homogeneous countries. Low pmn increased convergence for heterogeneous countries. These results are comparable to behaviors of Ghana, Japan, Afghanistan, etc. When actual countries were modeled, projected behaviors were more realistic than the results from the previous model.

SEARCH IN THE WEB FOR JUNIOR SCIENTIFIC INITIATION STUDENTS: AN ANALYSIS OF THE ON-LINE INFORMATION SOURCE USED
Sandro Bertelli
Instituto Federal Catarinense - Campus Camboriu, Camboriu, BRASIL

The use of the Web to access electronic information sources for scientific initiation researches in vocational high school is unquestionable. However, by the diversity of available contents it is needed that students/researchers develop informational competences which allow them identify, find, evaluate and use the informational in a correct and appropriate way to their needs. Aiming to qualitatively evaluate the on-line information source used by students who participate on Junior Scientific Initiation events it was done a descriptive survey using a quantitative and qualitative approach. About the research object of study it was defined lists of references shown in papers which were published in conference proceedings. As an evaluation tool of the selected references it was developed a matrix of evaluation that pooled the criteria in to broad categories to be quoted: evaluation of authorship, quality of the information, topicality of the information, relevance of the content and offer of supply mechanisms to help and deepen. From the 349 on-line collected references, only 63% (220) have shown electronic available address to consult. The researched topics can be identified by the recovered address; the other 30.5% (67) were directed to homepages of portals or similar where it was not possible to identify the probable content used by the researchers. We highlight that, among the electronic sources qualitatively evaluated, 65% had a score equal to or less than 5. The results demonstrated the importance of increasing the investment in educational processes that lead the students to do the search, selection and appropriated use of the on-line information proper to the context of technical-scientific researches.

ORDER VS. CHAOS IN THE TOWN
Natalia Ines McAlister
Liceo de Tarariras, Tarariras, URUGUAY

It was decided to investigate the urbanism in the town of Tarariras. This investigation problem was chosen because it is interesting to know the reasons of the difficulties the visitors have to orientate themselves in the town. The main goal was to know the reasons of the disorderly distribution of the town, based on the hypothesis that Tarariras is not well-ordered and this causes problems for visitors as well as residents. The methodology chosen to achieve these goals were: analysing maps of the town from different periods of time, doing surveys to inhabitants of Tarariras and visitors, and interviewing professionals related to the subject. The conclusions reached were that the reasons of the disordered distribution of the town are the lack of roads hierarchization and distributed signs which order the town. Another very important reason is that the town does not have a grid street plan. The reason of the foregoing is that the town was not planned. The town was born on a crossroad and experienced a high growth from 1950 with the opening of several industries, which promoted the growth around these points of interest, without following an order. Based on these conclusions, it was proposed to place more signs showing, for example, where police station and fire station are located. In addition to this, in order to guide visitors, it was proposed to place signs that show Tarariras’ map and the place where the sign is located.

THE EFFECTS OF A MULTI-FACTOR HAND HYGIENE INTERVENTION WITH MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING ON HAND WASHING EFFECTIVENESS, BEHAVIOR, ATTITUDES, AND ABSENCES OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
Timothy James Fossum Renier
East High School, Duluth, MN

Aim: This study instituted a hand hygiene intervention (INT) using motivational interviewing (MI) in a high school (HS) setting to improve hand washing effectiveness (HWE), behavior, attitudes, and illness related absences.<br><br>Methods: Within one HS, consent was obtained for 165 students who received classroom based INT, MI sessions, and lessons on real-world application of hand hygiene based on students’ future career choices including healthcare, foodservice, education, and the military. HWE scores were collected at weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13; anonymous surveys at weeks 1, 7, and 13, to assess behaviors and attitudes; students’ MI likeliness to change was ranked. Control school (CON) (n=71) aggregate absences were compared with INT using one-tailed t-tests. McNemar’s test evaluated change in HWE. Chi-squared tests evaluated hand washing behaviors, and Kruskal-Wallis’ test evaluated change in self-reported hand washing frequency. <br><br>Results: Significant (p<0.05) improvement was found between week 1 and 13 HWE scores. Significant association existed for MI likeliness to change and self-reported hand hygiene behavior change. Significant difference over time was found in hand washing frequency before eating, hand washing duration, belief hand hygiene can prevent illness, and interest in improving health through hand hygiene. Significant INT and CON absence difference was found for each 4-week period.<br><br>Conclusion: These findings show a multi-factor hand hygiene intervention with MI can significantly impact HWE, behaviors, attitudes, and absenteeism. Such an intervention may be applicable not only to high school settings, but also to others such as healthcare facilities, food service, and the military.

THE EFFECTS OF PHENOTYPE CHARACTERISTICS PREFERENCE ON MATE SELECTION
Jennifer Alice Bigley
Ackerman High School, Ackerman, MS

Phenotype preference can be related to by many factors, such as background, clothing, or learned behaviors. However this study focuses on the effect genetics can play on the phenotypic preference. Forty people from twenty different families were surveyed. Two people from each family were selected on a volunteer basis from a local population. Sets of visual and non-visual phenotype characteristics were presented in a survey format. Each participant was asked to choose the trait they preferred in a potential mate. These traits were varied from body type, eyebrow shape, hair length, and height. The results were recorded and statistically analyzed for each family. In an effort to determine validity of the results each individual’s data was compared randomly to a non-related participant. Overall the related group had a greater percentage of phenotypic preferences than the non-related group. Therefore genetically related mates will choose more common phenotypic characteristics than non-related mates.

SIBS OF THE SPECTRUM: EVALUATING SUPPORT GROUPS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A SIBLING WITH AUTISM
Katherine Emily Hufker
Lindbergh High School, St. Louis, MO

Sibling Support groups provide an opportunity for those who have a brother or sister with autism to meet others in a similar situation and learn more about their siblings. This project sought to determine whether these support groups help to improve sibling relationships. Participants were between 7 and 17 years old and had a sibling with autism who was at least 4 years old. The sibling’s relationship was determined using scores for warmth, parental attention, conflict, and whether or not they felt proud of their brother or sister, as determined by the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire. Before matching, those who had attended sibling support groups scored higher on all four measurements, though none was statistically significant. After matching for the age and gender of the sibling and individual with autism, the test group only outscored the control group in warmth. In addition, those participating in a support group reported that they felt more comfortable explaining autism to a family member (p=0.028), stranger (p=.063), familiar group (p=.034), or strange group (p<.001) than those that did not participate in a support group. This pattern stayed the same after matching for birth order and gender, with both the familiar group (p=.055) and strange group (p=.055) still statistically significant. To validate these findings, a similar study should be performed with a different design and more participants. These findings support the idea that sibling support groups can be beneficial for those who have a sibling with autism.

Jessica Jiamei Lee
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

BACKGROUND<br><br>The objective of this study was to compare the life satisfaction of Chinese-immigrant children versus their counterparts in America and China.<br><br>METHODS<br><br>Last year, the independent variable was Asian-immigrant children versus non-immigrant American children, and this year, the study was continued but the independent variable was narrowed down to Chinese-immigrant children versus native Chinese children. The dependent variable is their average life satisfaction score measured by using the Students’ Life Satisfaction Scale (SLSS, 1991, Huebner). Some personal information was obtained using a brief demographic information sheet. Means, standard deviations, p-values, t-tests, and multivariate linear regression were carried out by SPSS 21 and SAS 9.3.<br><br>RESULTS<br><br>After distributing around 170 surveys, 47 came back from Chinese immigrant adolescents, and 81 came back from native Chinese adolescents. In all, there were 48 males and 80 females.<br><br>The results showed that native Chinese children had a lower overall life satisfaction than Chinese- immigrant children (3.79±0.81 versus 4.39±0.83, p=0.0001). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that on average, Chinese immigrant children have a mean life satisfaction score of 0.71 higher than that of native Chinese children after adjusting for other potential confounding factors (Beta±SE: 0.71±0.17, p<0.0001).<br><br>CONCLUSIONS<br><br>Native Chinese children do have a lesser life satisfaction than their counterparts in America, they are more eager to change many things and wish for a different kind of life. Investigation on larger populations and with more complex scales may be necessary for a future study.

AIDING DEMENTIA PATIENTS WITH DAILY TASKS USING RFID
Divya Koyyalagunta
Clear Lake High School, Houston, TX

Almost 14% of people over the age of 71 have some form of dementia. As dementia progresses, it impacts the ability of the elderly to function independently and increases the burden on caregivers. To evaluate the feasibility of machine based prompting in aiding those with dementia, visual prompting and RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) were used in the place of a caregiver for three basic tasks: donning a sweater, brushing teeth and making a phone call. <br><br> Eleven subjects were initially proctored a MMSE (Mini-Mental Status Examination) to determine severity of dementia, and then asked to complete each of the three tasks independently. The residents were then tested at separate visits with visual cues as well as RFID that allowed them to prompt themselves to perform the tasks. A NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) was used to record the level of difficulty the resident had in completing the task.<br><br> Visual prompting provided a resourceful tool for helping dementia residents complete tasks, and RFID proved to be a viable method for promoting independent task completion. RFID showed a significant increase in the overall performance scores and the percentage of residents that completed the task. As seen in this study, machine based prompting showed a significant improvement in the success rate for residents to complete tasks in the absence of a caregiver. RFID holds great promise as a tool in aiding those with dementia for basic self-care and instrumental activities of daily living, as well as for teaching forgotten tasks.

This project investigates the universality of Irlen Method and colored overlays. Irlen Method uses color to improve the skills of people suffering from reading and learning disabilities. This study examined if colored overlays used for people suffering from Irlen Syndrome would improve the comprehension and speed at which a person with no pre existing reading disability reads. <br><br>Thirty fourteen to fifteen year old participants were split evenly into three test groups, each containing five girls and five boys. In these groups, participants were asked to read three simple, different passages. The separation of the groups determined which passages were read by the participant and the order in which the blue or peach colored overlays were used. The participant read the passage and answered five questions that followed each <br><br>The passages without any overlay were read slower than those with a blue or peach overlay. The slower the passage was read however, the better the comprehension scores were. Girls read slower than boys, causing their comprehension scores to also be higher. The order in which the overlays were used factored into the results recorded. When participants read a passage without an overlay last or second, the times were slower. In conclusion, the overlays increased the speed at which one reads, but did not improve the comprehension.<br><br>Since the part of the research hypothesis dealing with speed was accepted, an extension of this project would focus on the other portion of the experiment pertaining to improving comprehension.

POLAR BEARS, PENGUINS, AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING... OH MY!, YEAR THREE
Caitlyn Mary Ralph
Lake Howell High School, Winter Park, FL

As society is rapidly replacing traditional classroom instruction with technological techniques, testing needs to be done to assess if these changes are negatively affecting students’ education. The aim of this study was to determine whether converting a paper-based comic activity, the traditional method, into a web-based application would alter a learner’s cognitive processing. The web-based application was produced by the researcher. To test this, 98 high school students completed an activity via the web-based application and 38 different students completed the same activity via the paper-based print-out. The students also filled out a Likert survey to evaluate germane cognitive load. Paas and van Merrienboer’s training efficiency formula was employed during data analysis which assessed students’ performance (accuracy) level in comparison to their mental effort (estimates of cognitive load).<br><br>Based on a series of t-tests, the null hypothesis is accepted with caution. It was found that the germane cognitive load survey, mental effort, and training efficiency data had no significant difference between the traditional and web-based methods with p-values of .28, .94, and .97 respectively. However, the accuracy of the students’ work did have a significant difference with a p-value of .0017 supporting the traditional method.<br><br>This shows that convenient web-based methods can slowly be introduced in older students’ classrooms alongside traditional methods. Students need to be taught and exposed to these new instruments effectively, therefore raising their experience and in effect their accuracy performance. Ultimately, it was indicated that overall there was no significant difference between traditional and web-based methods in cognitive processing.

THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDIA ON GENDER STEREOTYPES AND THE FURTHERING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Petra Katherine Ronald
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

The media has been shown to influence adolescents in various ways. In past studies, body image and gender stereotypical beliefs have been associated with the amount of media to which an adolescent has been exposed. This study expands on those associations and also takes a new approach to find a correlation between the media and adolescents’ perpetration and acceptance of sexual harassment. A survey of 332 freshmen high-school students, 167 boys and 165 girls, was taken, and both the type and amount of media exposure the participants listed were analyzed. It was found that exposure to high sexual reality television shows was associated to more gender stereotypical views, more acceptance of sexual harassment, and more perpetration of sexual harassment when compared to low sexual reality television shows. Furthermore, exposure to high sexual reality shows had less significance when compared to high sexual scripted television shows, proving that the sexual content of the media adolescents are exposed to has an effect on their gender stereotypical views, acceptance of sexual harassment, and perpetration of sexual harassment. This is disconcerting due to the increase in sexual content of today’s media and the rising new genre of reality television. Sexual harassment and gender stereotypes shouldn’t be acceptable in today’s society, yet the media appears to be supporting them. With this research, the portrayals of the media in adolescent TV programs may be subject to change with time.

DEVELOPING AN ANDROID TABLET APPLICATION FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Nazia Ejaz Ahmed
Williams High School, Plano, TX

Alzheimer’s disease is a dementia that is one of the leading causes of death without a cure. With an early diagnosis, however, reversible symptoms may be treated and the otherwise rapid progression of the dementia may also be slowed down. Today’s conventional methods of diagnosis such as brain scans and paper tests do not allow an early enough diagnosis to take such precautionary measures. In order to resolve the problems encountered by today’s diagnostic methods, a 20-question Android application timed test was developed to detect early signs of cognitive impairment. The application was tested on three groups: a group of healthy seniors (HS), another group of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a group of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Trimmed means were calculated for each question answered by the three participant groups, and percent changes were calculated between these values. Higher scores on the test signified more severe cognitive impairment, meaning greater percent changes were associated with the questions that were more effective in detecting early impairment signs. There was a positive percent increase from the trimmed mean of the HS to that of the MCI participants, meaning that the application was effective in detecting early signs. The percent increase in the math category seen from the trimmed mean of the HS to that of those with MCI was significantly greater than the percent changes observed in the verbal and visual categories, leading to the conclusion that the math questions were most effective in detecting early impairment signs.

HOW EXPOSURE TO HUMAN PHEROMONES AFFECTS ATTRACTION RATINGS FOR STRANGERS
Samantha Heidersdorf
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

To determine how pheromone exposure affects attraction ratings for strangers I extracted pheromones from control pads and those worn overnight by male and female volunteers. Extracts were applied to 72 surgical masks: 24 male pheromone, 24 female pheromone, and 24 controls. Sampling kits were made for 12 male and 12 female subjects with each mask type according to a Latin square experimental design. For each mask, the subject rated four photos of the opposite gender for 12 qualities (attractiveness, trustworthiness, dangerousness, etc), for 12 photos total. Questions were grouped into four indices: Attractiveness (ATI), Genetic Fitness (GFI), Emotional Fitness (EFI), and Avoidance (AVI). <br><br> Female subjects exposed to male pheromones rated higher than controls for ATI, GFI, and EFI across all 12 photos, but the effect was strongest for the first four, possibly from desensitization of pheromone receptors over time. Male subject data was more complex. The results supported my hypothesis that female attraction ratings would be higher when exposed to male pheromones. Males, however, only rated physical appearance higher, and unexpectedly, reacted stronger to male pheromones, possibly due to competition pressure. Though sample sizes were small, statistically significant results were observed for EFI ratings of females exposed to male pheromones (p=0.031) and when comparing pooled male or female masks versus control (p<0.036). The effect seemed strongest on judgment of emotional fitness by females. <br><br> The results of my experiment will help scientists understand how subconscious detection of human pheromones might affect the choice of a mate, even in today's society.

Hedgesville High School, Hedgesville, WV

From previous experimentation it is evident that the Stroop Effect affects the ability to recall the appropriate color; however, can these results be correlated to the different stages of psychological development and different tests similar to the Stroop Effect?<br><br>Two hundred volunteers were asked to name row one & row two of the Stroop Effect test and a self generated shapes test. In each test row one did not correspond to the variable that must not be named. For instance, the word red would be printed in the color purple and volunteers would be asked to name the color or the word circle would be printed inside of the shape of a square and the volunteer would be asked to name the shape. Either way it presents a challenge and the interference of the automatic reading results in a challenge when naming the shape or color. The 200 volunteers were separated by the different growth spurts in the human brain. Average Time: Boys: Stroop Effect Test: Ages 5-8: 14.16, Ages 10-12: 9.04, Ages 13-15: 5.815, and Ages 17-21: 3.92 TAverage Time: Girls: Stroop Effect: Ages 5-8 12.76, Ages 10-12: 8.28, Ages 13-15: 4.2, and Ages 17-21: 3.92 Average Time: Boys: Shapes Test: Ages 5-8: 12.88, Ages 10-12: 9.72, Ages 13-15: 6, Ages 17-21: 4.12. Average Time: Girls: Shapes Test: Ages 5-8: 12.12, Ages 10-12: 6.52, Ages 13-15: 4.96, Ages 17-21: 3.76. Statistical analyses' were taken and there is a significant difference between the row one and row two of both tests as well as between the different brain stages.<br><br>All in all, I conclude that there is a significant correlation between different stages of brain development and the Stroop Effect and Shapes test. As the age increases the time difference decreases. Different factors such as phonological awareness and Myelination effect the results.

THE AT-RISK MATURING BRAIN: EFFECTS OF STRESS PARADIGMS ON MOOD, MEMORY AND COGNITION IN ADOLESCENTS AND THE ROLE OF THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
Zarin Ibnat Rahman
Brookings High School, Brookings, SD

The adolescent brain, especially the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) that controls a number of cognitive functions, is within maturation. Research has revealed that the changes in the PFC increase its susceptibility to both good and bad stimuli in the environment. This makes adolescent brain more at-risk to external stressors, like sleep deprivation and excessive screen time exposure. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate if these off-school stress paradigms affect adolescent neurobehavioral functions, especially mood, cognition and working memory. This investigation is the first to describe excessive screen time exposure in adolescents and their associations with sleep patterns, stress, and cognitive performance. Adolescents’ (n=67) were divided in two groups: Normal Sleep (NS) and Sleep Deprived (SD) on the basis of Sleep Survey. Sleep habits and screen time exposure were assessed to determine the relation between sleep patterns and screen time exposure. A series of behavioral and neuropsychological tests that assess daytime sleepiness (PDSS), attention (SynWin and Stroop), mood and anxiety (POMS-A and STAI) and working memory (PASAT) were administered. Two-way ANOVA, followed by t-test and with Bonferrroni corrections for multiple comparisons, was used to compare the 2 groups. Pearson correlation was used to test the relations among the variables. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The findings clearly indicate that electronic activities shape adolescents' sleep pattern reducing sleep time and the systematic stress and fatigue of sleep deprivation affect mood, memory and cognition, supporting the stated hypotheses. The findings raise a public health concern regarding off-school stress paradigms and neurobehavioral functioning in adolescents.

THE IMPACT OF ONLINE PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
Krissa Rose Woodring
Snowcrest Junior High School, Eden, UT

The purpose of this study is to determine if the responses to online teaching interventions targeting specific learning styles are related to age. A Power-Point presentation on Asian Geography was created consisting of 10 slides where each contained a different fact . Two slides were designed for each of the 5 major online learning styles (kinesthetic, visual, writing, visual, and audio). After viewing the slides, students were shown 10 questions directly related to the facts previously viewed. This PowerPoint was shown to 6th, 9th, and High School students. A Chi squared and ANOVA test were conducted to compare ages and online learning responses. The test results showed that there were not only differences among age groups, but there were also predominant learning styles for each group. There was a significant difference between the 6th and 9th and 6th and 10th in all of the learning styles except audio. There was not a significant difference between 9th and High School students. In 6th grade, kinesthetic and reading were the strongest compared to writing and visual which were lower. In the 9th and High School groups, kinesthetic and reading were the highest scoring with audio scoring the lowest. The predominant learning style in all of the age groups was kinesthetic. The results of this study show that learning styles differ as students progress through their education. As K-12 classrooms incorporate more online learning into their curriculum, it is both possible and important that learning styles be utilized when designing instructional materials.

THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF INFRASOUND ON HUMANS
Sarah Eva DiSalvo
Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas, Nevada, Henderson, NV

The purpose of this experiment is to psychologically and physiologically observe how humans respond to Infrasound. Infrasound is sound that is below the human hearing range. It has extremely low frequencies from 20 hertz to 0.001 hertz, and extremely high decibels. However, even though you may not be able to hear Infrasound, you can feel it through large vibrations caused by its sound waves. When testing humans exposed to Infrasound it could result in higher blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature as well as a unusual feelings and anxiety. This would be caused by a very important nervous system in the human body called the peripheral nervous system which is responsible for detecting sensations such as pain, warmth, coldness, and vibrations. When a sensation is detected it is sent to your brain where the sensation will be processed. Because of how abnormal the Infrasound sound waves are, the human body could respond negatively to the vibrations, making someone feel very anxious and nervous. During the experiment, one person at a time would walk into a room for 3 minutes exposed to Infrasound. The results of the experiment physiologically were: 86% of the humans had a much higher heart rates then before the experiment, 68% had higher temperatures, and 75% had lower blood pressures and 52% had higher respiratory rates. Psychologically 96% felt calm before the experiment, However, during the experiment 52% felt very anxious, and 72% felt extremely unusual and nervous. But the control group that was not exposed to Infrasound felt completely normal through out the whole test. The Infrasound made the human subjects have lower blood pressure, higher heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate as well as the humans feeling unusual and anxious.

MY PROJECT IS FANTASTIC! GENDER DIFFERENCES IN SELF-PROMOTION AND THEIR EFFECTS ON PERCEPTIONS OF A COLLEGE ESSAY
Arshia Aalami Harandi
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY

Studies have found that men report higher tendencies to self-promote in the job application process than women and that the effect of self-promotion depends on the candidate’s gender. Self-promotion in job interviews, although effective in advocating for one’s competence, has led to backlash for female self-promoters. However, no study has investigated whether similar effects exist in the college application process. This project presents the results of two studies conducted to fill this void. The first study sought to determine whether young men and women have different tendencies to self-promote. Essays were gathered from high school juniors, coded by trained raters, and analyzed for gender differences. Young men reported having self-promoted more successfully than young women and did, in fact, write more about their accomplishments and themselves and less about others. The second study investigated whether self-promoting and the applicant’s gender affect how college admissions officers and guidance counselors perceive an applicant. These professionals were randomly assigned to read a college essay that varied the level of self-promotion and the applicant’s gender. Results indicated that the self-promoting male applicant was rated as more socially skilled, likable, and likely to get accepted to a college than the self-promoting female applicant. In addition, likability was found to be the best predictor of perceptions of likely acceptance. The two studies suggest that women are less likely to self-promote in the college essay and experience backlash when they do. Future research should investigate how women can present their achievements without triggering backlash.

THE EFFECTS OF AN ADMINISTRATOR'S PROSODY ON AUTISTIC CHILDREN
Shannon Catherine Boley
Westfield High School, Westfield, MA

This project used a single subject alternating treatment design to test how three autistic children responded to directions said in a monotone, animated, and a typical tone of voice; these were quantified by peak frequencies measured with Fast Fourier Transform tests. It was hypothesized that an animated (higher pitch) voice would spur a higher percent independence because of its correlation with positive reinforcement. Sixteen directions that the students had previously mastered, as determined by Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), were recorded in the three different tones of voice. ABA tests which incorporated the previously mastered directions were developed and sent to the students’ school, where qualified teachers tested the students using the audio CD. For the higher functioning student, the prosody had little effect on percent independence, indicating that tone of voice did not affect his ability to comprehend directions. One lower functioning student indicated a clear preference for the animated voice, while the other experienced an enhanced ability to comprehend directions stated in either a monotone or animated tone. Although the original hypothesis was disproved, this data contributes to previous research and shows that lower functioning students are more affected by tone of voice than higher functioning autistic students. By repeating this test for lower functioning autistic students in the future, one can determine what tone of voice each individual best responds to. Although ideally students should respond to all tones of voice equally, this data can be used to more effectively phase out negative behaviors.

THE IMPACT OF PARENTING STYLE ON ADOLESCENT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: A CROSS-CULTURAL STUDY
Ye Rin Koh
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

The present study investigates the relationship between perceived parenting style and emotional intelligence in a population of high school to college-aged adolescents. There was a comparison of results between a Korean-American sample and a European-American sample to examine the role of culture in determining the degree of impact parenting style has on emotional intelligence. Perceived parenting style and authoritativeness were measured using Steinberg’s Parenting Style Index. Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form was used to measure the subjects’ trait emotional intelligence (TEI). Kruskal-Wallis analysis showed statistically significant differences between parenting styles on emotional intelligence for both cultural groups (p=.020, Korean-Americans; p=.045, European-Americans). Parental acceptance, involvement and warmth appeared to be particularly beneficial to the development of TEI in both groups. Authoritative parenting was associated with higher TEI, especially in the Korean-American sample. Conversely, data suggests a detrimental consequence of authoritarian parenting style on adolescent emotional intelligence for both cultures, despite its common perception as a typical, accepted style of parenting in Asian-American families; this finding also contradicts an implication of some past studies suggesting that authoritarian parenting is not as harmful for Asian adolescents. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of cultural consideration in research regarding the consequences of parenting and encourages parenting behavior that best fosters the development of emotional intelligence in all adolescents, regardless of culture.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT SCHOOL: PEDAGOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES FOUND BY BRAZILIAN SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS
Tulio Vinicius Andrade Souza
Grupo Genese de Ensino, Recife, BRASIL

The diseases that most kill people in the world are related to sedentary behaviors, and school plays an important role in cultivating healthy habits that can reverse this condition. However, even though physical education is one of the most appropriate school subjects to work on these issues, its teaching conditions in Brazil are alarming. In my research, I aimed to identify the main difficulties found by secondary school teachers, analyze their implications and develop effective teaching strategies to solve them. Initially, I worked with 20 physical education teachers, who answered a questionnaire that aimed to identify the obstacles faced by them in their routines. The initial analysis pointed to the three most frequent difficulties: lack of materials, lack of physical space, and lack of students’ interest. The results led to the development of pedagogical strategies focused on integrating students with learning. To test the efficiency and applicability of these strategies, for two months I applied a didactic sequence with 45 juniors from a private high school. Participants completed questionnaires before and after the application of the didactic sequence, so that I could verify the behavior change, the appropriation of concepts and students' perceptions about the intervention. The impressive results showed a significant improvement in students’ concepts. To describe these strategies, I developed a handbook specifically for physical education teachers. Aiming to disseminate this material, I carried out a training with 19 teachers, after which 94.73% of the teachers that would apply my solutions in their classes. I believe that the results presented in this study bring important contributions to physical education teachers´ and can help students develop healthy habits.

EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE SKILLS OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM WHILE IMPLEMENTING PROLOQUO2GO
Courtney Alexandra Astore
Cardinal Mooney Catholic High School, Sarasota, FL

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders often present with a wide range of expressive language delays; therefore, at times requiring augmentative devices to assist in their verbal communication. The device Proloquo2go is an augmentative, alternative communication application that is used on iPhones, iPads, and iTouches. This study examined the increase in verbal approximations and mean length of utterances of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The procedures of this study included: 1) reading the book “Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See?”, 2) asking the child “What do you see?” without the augmentative application Proloquo2go and one week later with the Proloquo2go application. Six subjects were chosen to participate in this experiment. Data was collected on the number of words approximated by the subjects. The results of this experiment followed the hypothesis. All of the subjects tested in this study demonstrated improvements ranging from 10-64% more verbal approximations with the use of the Proloquo2go application. Overall, a 36% increase in verbal approximations for the group of 6 subjects was presented. Results indicated that use of the Proloquo2go application was effective and significant improvements in the expressive language skills of students with Autism Spectrum Disorders occurred. During the course of the experiment, the subjects displayed an increase in verbal approximations and a longer mean length of utterances with the use of this application. Future research and investigation should focus on implementing Proloquo2go with a variety of expressive language tasks and a larger group of subjects.

CAPTURE YOUR EEG - DEVELOPING RELIABLE BIO-INDICATORS AND CORRESPONDING ANDROID APP FOR SAFE DRIVING
Jenny Wang
William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, NC

Each year, a high percentage of accidents are caused by drowsy drivers. In addition to safe driving education, new technology that can detect driver fatigue is critically needed. This project focuses on using EEG technology to detect driver fatigue. Common drowsy symptoms, including blinking, extended eye closing, and yawning, were used as bio-indicators to detect driver fatigue. A low cost dry EEG headset captured human subjects’ EEG signals for analysis during alert and drowsy states. The raw EEG data was digitally sampled and band filtered into eight distinct frequency bands, from Delta to high Gamma. The power of each spectrum band was calculated at every second. Analytic comparisons between alert and sleepy states were made in order to find a correlation between EEG signals and human fatigue indicators. Using the non-linear energy operator filter, the responding power peaks were identified. Two metrics, the peak to mean ratio and the number of response peaks, were used to quantify the strength and participation of EEG spectrum bands. Experiment results have shown that spectrum power spikes of certain EEG frequency bands are reliable bio-indicators for detecting specific types of fatigue phenomena. Based on the resulting power signatures, detection algorithms were created. A prototype Android Smartphone App was then developed, which demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique. The headset sends the EEG data to the Smartphone via Bluetooth. With the onset of bio-indicators, the corresponding EEG fatigue signature will be detected, triggering audio/video output on the phone to alert the drowsy driver.

WHEN ONE CUP OF WATER IS LESS THAN ONE CUP OF WATER: AT WHAT AGE DOES A CHILD'S COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO CONSERVE VOLUME AND NUMBERS
Bridget Forsha Dorsey
Mount Ogden Junior High School, Ogden, UT

The age at which children develop the cognitive ability to conserve mass and numbers has been studied only to find the developmental stages at which this skill is obtained. However, children are placed in grade levels based on age rather than cognitive development, so their age is also relevant. I tested kindergarteners and first graders age 5-7 in local schools, after obtaining consent from parents. Each test consisted of two parts: mass and numbers. To test for an understanding of volume conservation I poured water into a different shape of container and asked the child to tell me if there was more, less, or the same amount of water. To test for number conservation I had one row of ten game chips which I then moved into two rows of five and asked if there were more, less, or the same number of chips. This process took place separately with each child. Children’s skills were much more developed in the numbers portion of their cognitive understanding than the mass portion. This indicates that they could also use other skills such as counting. The child’s cognitive ability to conserve was not developed until the age of seven, which was still not at an ideal level. This particular skill directly correlates with math at the elementary level. Since conservation skills aren’t part of the curriculum, students have problems when they start to learn addition, subtraction, etc.

EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
Victoria Rose Phillips
Davis High School, Kaysville, UT

In the court justice system, it is common for eyewitness testimony to be used as reliable information in criminal cases. It was the aim of this project to prove the unreliability of eyewitness testimony and prevent its further use in the court system. Previous test results demonstrated that eye witness testimony was unreliable, but inattentional blindness produced unusable data because subjects did not perceive the crime that was perpetrated. Last year, while isolating the variable of suggestion, results showed a slight increase of correct identification, but the percentages remained low; inattentional blindness continued to play a significant role in the results. In order to overcome this variable, an experiment was designed that would tap into social and human tendencies. This procedure gave students something they would not want to look away from, i.e., a peer throwing a temper tantrum because of an unfair grade. Results showed with a 95% confidence interval, the true mean fell between 30.8% and 42.6% of individuals who were able to identify the correct photo. Participants that got a good look at the perpetrator’s face demonstrated nearly an entire elimination of inattentional blindness, creating optimal conditions for giving accurate eyewitness testimony. These numbers directly correlate with the four years of previous research, demonstrating the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. This project may be useful in encouraging lawmakers to adopt model procedures in the use of eyewitness testimony and the gradual elimination of it as primary evidence.

MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING AS A FORM OF STRESS RELIEF IN ADOLESCENTS
Allison Michelle Kath
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Motivational Interviewing is a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (a psychotherapeutic approach that focuses on dysfunctional emotions and their manifestations in actions) that was first devised for middle-¬‐aged problem-¬‐drinking men. Although it is very effective, its effects haven’t been studied a.) to treat stress or b.) in adolescents. In other words, a potentially very useful therapy technique was unavailable to a large demographic. Thirty Tucson High Magnet School students of both genders between the ages of 14-¬‐18 consented and/or received parental consent to participate in research that consisted of two participation groups. All participants completed and Adolescent Stress Questionnaire, (ASQ) engaged in either a Motivational Interviewing-¬‐style conversation (experimental group) or a Stress Education-¬‐style conversation, (control group) and completed a second ASQ 7-¬‐10 days later. Because the experimental group demonstrated a decrease in stress of approximately 17% while the control group demonstrated an increase in stress of < 1%, these results are considered significant. However, due to the small sample size, these results are also considered preliminary, and they lend support to the efficacy of Motivational Interviewing in an identical study with a larger sample size.

A MODEL OF MEDIAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX GRID CELL REMAPPING
Ryan Diego Silva
University High Scool, Tucson, AZ

How does the brain navigate space? Two spatial neurons in the hippocampal network have a key role in navigation. Place cells create a ‘cognitive map’ of space through their place fields, or areas in the world over which they fire. Grid cells create a metric of space using a triangular lattice of place fields. The role of grid cells in place field formation, although unknown, could be a key element in understanding the phenomenon called remapping. Remapping is a mechanism by which changes in an environment are perceived. During this event grid fields shift, which is thought to drive the more unpredictable movement of place fields. Remapping allows cognitive maps to store information about location, context and purpose. <br><br>This project focuses on demonstrating that two grid cells with different spatial periods are suitable to represent a point in space unambiguously before and after remapping. To demonstrate this, a simulation of grid cells in MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is modified to produce two networks with different periods. The result is that the two grid fields overlap over a finite number of points in space. One point has significantly more overlapping activity than any of the others, suggesting that with more grid cells a single point will emerge, allowing for place field formation. The conclusion is that through this method of remapping, the results match and seem to be as sporadic as data recorded from animals, and this simulation could be used to predict how the brain reacts when identifying its location.

EFFECT OF THE MUSIC THERAPY ON INHIBITORY CONTROL OF CHILDREN VICTIMS OF MALTREATMENT
Jose Carlos Consuelo Perez
Preparatoria del Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, MEXICO

The purpose of the present investigation was to increase the motor inhibitory control (MIC) on children victims of maltreatment through passive music therapy. The research was integrated by two experiments in which passive music therapy has been applied with Mozart´s music in piano and violin. During the first experiment, we used a pretest-posttest design where 14 music therapy sessions were applied to 5 elementary school children from a shelter (August-September, 2012). The assessment of MIC was made through two games: in the first, the boys had to move with an indication, and they had to stop with a signal; in the second, they had to move while the music was playing and had to stop when the music ended. In the second experiment, we applied a O1 X O2 – O3/O4 – O5 X O6 design, with two groups of preschool children from two shelters. We applied 28 music therapy sessions and 3 samples and again, children behavior was observed (indications given without expected response) using the described games. Both experiments presented an increment in the MIC, but the increment of the MIC in the second experiment was more evident due the corrections of the second design applied. We hope that our data help to develop effective treatments for strengthening inhibitory functions in children who were victims of maltreatment.

Social problems in children between the age of six to ten years old, like isolation, aggresivity violence, are generated by the use of videogames? The target is to make children rangin from six to ten years, stop using videogames as a daily activity, and by this way using their time in activities to develop physical and mental skills these are developed trough application of reading workshops didactic games, as physical activity. Using this method children negative attitudes were diminished, provoked by videogames. Videogames are a brreaktrough that happend averywhere but we focused in Cuauhtemoc primary school in Mexico state Nezahualcoyotl cuty, getting resols from before and after. The work was done with children from this school, by making workshops thus developing their abilities. The purpose of this proyect was to make able children to perform new didactic activities and that they take equal or more interest than videogames in this way they developed physical abilities as metacognitive abilities. The less use of videogames in children from six to ten years old at Cuauhtemoc primary school in Nezahualcoyotl cuty, the less social problems and major signs of cognitive skills presented by the children.

HUD AS A VARIANT-SPECIFIC REGULATOR OF NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE ADULT HIPPOCAMPUS: IMPLICATIONS IN ALZHEIMER’S DEMENTIA
Miguel Ignacio Paredes
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

Alzheimer’s dementia is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 10 to 20% of all people over the age of 65 and causes the rapid deterioration of long-term memory. Yet, despite Alzheimer’s affecting millions of people worldwide, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling this global decline in memory are still poorly understood. Thus, the purpose of my project is to test the effects of a protein, called HuD, on the degeneration of long-term memory seen in Alzheimer’s Dementia and to test its role as a potential therapeutic target for this behavioral abnormality. In this study, through loss-of-function models, it was demonstrated that HuD is vital to the normal storage and retrieval of long-term memory, using the Morris water maze. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that, through cell cycle and neurite outgrowth analyses, HuD is a key mediator in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, forcing progenitors out of the cell cycle and into post-mitotic neuronal differentiation through variant-specific regulation. Disruption in this process, as seen through golgi-staining analysis in loss-of-function models, leads to abnormalities in memory and to a severe decrease in neuronal complexity, mimicking the pathological characteristics found in dementia patients. Thus, the data reveal a potential therapeutic target that could be used to combat the devastating behavioral anomaly that accompanies Alzheimer’s Dementia: loss of long-term memory. These results also expound on the basic dogma of all behavioral sciences in which genetic and molecular influences can have a drastic effect on the behavior of dynamic, developing organisms.

THE EFFECT OF SLEEP ON COGNITION AND MOTOR DEVELOPMENT IN INFANTS
Fatmira Curovic
Staten Island Technical High School, Staten Island, NY

Several studies have demonstrated that sleep plays an essential role in infants’ growth, specifically in cognitive and motor development. However, the effect of sleep on cognition and motor development in infants has rarely been studied. The purpose of this experiment is to examine the relationship between sleep and naptime on consolidation and abstraction. Consolidation is the recall of a memory, while abstraction is the formation of a memory with a repeated exposure to a stimulus. This study was separated into two conditions: the learning curve and the nap condition of the sleep-learning. The learning curve condition included eight participants, who were either crawlers or walkers. The nap condition of sleep-learning had ten participants that were required to be new walkers. These participants were given the task of crawling through a tunnel to reach a goal at the end of the tunnel. When the number of restarts, postural shifts, and prompts were measured, a Pearson’s correlation showed a negative trend in the relation of these variables to the walk experience of the infants in days. In addition, there was also statistical significance for the number of prompts and shifts. As predicted, the infants with the least walking experience found it more difficult to crawl through the tunnel. In addition, there were less postural shifts, restarts, and prompts (measure of task difficulty) in the post-test than in the pre-test of the nap condition, supporting the hypothesis that sleep enhances memory consolidation in infants. Continued data collections will include an increase in sample size, and the addition of a new motor task for the sleep-learning portion of the study.

DETERMINING THE ORIGIN OF CLUSTERING AND SWITCHING ABILITIES DURING VERBAL FLUENCY TASKS: A LESION STUDY
Hope Eliana Merens
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

The study “Determining the Origin of Clustering and Switching Abilities During Verbal Fluency Tasks: A Lesion Study” tried to determine which brain regions are critical to verbal fluency and its associated strategies, clustering words together and switching between clusters. The study holds importance because understanding where clustering and switching occur in the brain can serve as a way to preliminarily diagnose where tumors are in a patient’s brain. Data from eighty-two subjects with a focal lesion in the left frontal, right frontal, left temporal, or right temporal lobe was used. Semantic and phonemic scoring criteria for strategies were made for categorization and letter fluency tasks to score subjects’ verbal fluency tests, which were collected from the brain tumor database at a local hospital. Results found that for the overall words generated, left side damage to the brain resulted in lower scores than right side damage in categorization tasks, p<0.001, and letter tasks, p=0.001; in letter tasks, frontal lobe damage resulted in lower scores than temporal damage, p=0.002. All tasks showed that left side damage would lower scores for the number of clusters produced (alpha level=0.05), and some significance was found or scores trended to suggest that left side damage would adversely affect the size of clusters and the number of switches produced. The study provides novel scoring guidelines for verbal fluency tasks, and the results imply an associative frontal-temporal network for verbal fluency in the left hemisphere where the frontal lobe is important for executive functioning and the temporal lobe provides stored information.

CAN PARSING GOOGLE AND TWITTER RELIABLY REFLECT POLITICAL TRENDS?
Zachary Matthew Solloway
Park Vista Community High School, Lake Worth, FL

This scientific experiment was conducted in order to determine whether the employment of parsing mechanisms could yield a reliable indication of a candidate’s poll numbers. During the experiment, Gallup poll numbers as well as total Twitter and Google traffic that involved the four candidates were calculated by relying on data from November 6, 2011 to February 12, 2012 regarding Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul. Data collected from these four candidates demonstrated a relative correlation between online search traffic and their approval rating. For example, republican preference of Newt Gingrich from 12/1/11 to 12/14/11 was 31.3%. From 12/15/11 to 12/29/11 republican preference for Newt Gingrich was 23.5%. On Google, a downward trend was also evident, declining from 1.28% (during 12/1/11 to 12/14/11) to 0.82% (during 12/15/11 to 12/29/11). Due to this data, it is evident that the downward trend experienced by Newt Gingrich during this period of time occurred at a similar rate to his downward trend in the polls. On Twitter, a downward trend was also evident, declining from 0.04% (during 12/1/11 to 12/14/11) to 0.02% (during 12/15/11 to 12/29/11). The second phase of the experiment employed a linear model that reliably predicted a candidate’s approval rating based on total Twitter traffic. For example, on 12/22/11, total Twitter traffic involving the term “Mitt Romney” was 0.05%, and the linear model (revealing a regression formula of R2=0.28653), predicted his approval rating to be 26.9%, when his actual approval rating according to Gallup was 27%.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF VISUAL AWARENESS DURING PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION
Danila Alferov
A.B. Lucas Secondary School, London, CANADA

The neural basis of consciousness is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience. One particularly important type of conscious awareness is visual perception.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to observe the neural correlates of visual awareness by using a novel psychophysical model and neuroimaging (fMRI).The psychophysical model was developed to capture a phenomenon known as persistence, a form of duration of visual awareness. Upon the start of every trial, observers were presented with a camouflaging background and after a delay with a contour made from line segments. Observers perceived the contour as segregated from the background, but eventually the contour faded into the background. The psychophysical model used multiple controlled variables for the contour: density, radius, jitter (angular deviation from co-linearity). <br><br>The results demonstrated that the co-aligned contour was perceived for 413 milliseconds longer than the misaligned contour on average. Based on the linear regression model, when jitter increases by 1° the duration of awareness decreases by 18 milliseconds.<br><br> <br><br>From the fMRI experiments, three key visual areas in the brain confirmed a neurological difference between co-aligned and misaligned contours. Interestingly, an attention area, parietal lobe, is highly sensitive to the effects of varying jitter, giving evidence towards a possible positive feedback loop where parietal lobe modulates in-coming signal from visual areas and controls their analysis of the contour.<br><br>The psychophysical model and neuroimaging may be applied to study brain plasticity in early visual areas, to compute edge continuity statistics in natural images and build an artificial visual system.

NEURAL PLASTICITY: NOVEL LANGUAGE LEARNING THROUGH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
Adelina Corina Cozma
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, CANADA

The research aims to develop a neuroimaging protocol composed of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine the spatial-temporal dynamics of the brain mechanisms involved in the cognitive and motor control aspects of language reception and production when learning foreign vocabulary words using innovative multi-day software program training. 14 native English speakers, (mean age=28.4±4.7SD years; 7 female), naïve to Romanian, learned 50 disyllabic Romanian words. Before and after training, subjects completed MRI/MEG sessions involving object naming and picture matching tasks to auditory-presented native and foreign words. Data were analyzed using statistical and beamforming methods on measures of accuracy, fluency, and reaction/voice-onset times obtained throughout the training and MEG tasks. The results revealed that novel words are first learned by building on the existing language network, and after neural integration they evoke different brain activations compared to native words. Unexpectedly, results show that during novel language processing, functions of the brain’s receptive and expressive language systems are not mutually exclusive. Wernicke’s area, part of the receptive language network, was involved in producing language, whereas Broca’s area was involved in processing incoming language. This is the first demonstration of brain changes after learning novel words over a brief but intensive software training period. The findings have implications for clinical conditions where language localization is of interest, and they have led to the development of a hardware-software system that can improve receptive and expressive language abilities in typically developing individuals and those with learning disabilities.

IMPROVING LONG-TERM COMPLIANCE TO LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS
Avinash Kumar Pandey
Waterloo Collegiate Institute, Waterloo, CANADA

Studies show that non-compliance to medications is prevalent. In heart attack (MI) patients four classes of “life saving” medications are crucial to long-term health. Yet, compliance remains below 50% at one year post-MI. As forgetfulness has been identified as a leading cause for medication non-compliance, a text message reminder system was developed to address forgetfulness. This study tests the hypothesis that an automated text message reminder system will improve compliance to medications over a one year period. After written informed consent, thirty-four post heart attack patients were randomized into a control group which did not receive text message reminders and an intervention group which did receive text message reminders. Participants logged their compliance to medications. One control patient withdrew consent to continue in this study and their data was censored. In the control group compliance fell over time from 92% at month 1 to 70% at month 12. In the intervention group compliance dropped from 98% month 1 to 90% at month 12. Text message reminders significantly improved compliance. By month 12, there was 20% greater compliance with text message reminders (p<0.0001). Overall, there was a relative risk reduction for missing doses of 68% (p<0.0001). Previous studies have suggested that the elderly and the less educated have lower compliance rates; these groups were prospectively assessed and did have lower compliance at baseline but also improved more with this system. In all subgroups analyzed, this system consistently improved compliance to life saving medications over a one year time span.

TESTING AND IMPROVING ICT-ENHANCED SKILLS FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA USING ROBOTICS, MODULAR CONSTRUCTION AND PSR
Osama Khalid Hassan
Asrary School, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

With the evolution of technology, it becomes essential to introduce new ways to enhance problem-solving skills at early school ages, since it is considered to be a key asset to any country with the goal to become a "knowledge-based" society. The purpose is to identify an educational scenario using PSR (Problem-Solving Robotics) to test and improve ICT-enhanced skills.<br><br>The procedure started with randomly choosing 120 students from a public and a private school. Each school was then divided into a controlled and an experimental groups of 30 students .The students were tested with the conventional and the PSR test to find a correlation between the two tests. Next, the conventional course was applied to the controlled group and the PSR course to the experimental one. Then, the students were tested with the conventional method to measure their development. A preference questionnaire was distributed to 30 specialists to determine the preferred method. <br><br>A strong, positive correlation coefficient of 0.7216 was found between the two tests. A T-test result of 2.250 was found between the posttest results of the controlled group and the experimental group in favor of the experimental group, meaning that PSR course improves ICT-enhanced skills more than the conventional course. 73.47%% of the specialists prefer the PSR method over the conventional one.<br><br>PSR can be used to improve ICT-enhanced skills, such as: information, project management, presentation, leadership and teamwork skills. It can also be used to solve future problems using creative methods.

QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF NIGHTTIME LIGHT EXPOSURE AND SLEEP DURATION ON MELATONIN LEVELS IN ADOLESCENTS
Caleb Hersh
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Chronic deprivation of the circadian hormone melatonin, which can be suppressed by nighttime light exposure or sleep deprivation, has been implicated as a cancer risk factor in adult populations. However, for adolescents, the impact of light exposure and behavioral factors such as sleep duration, on melatonin levels is not well understood. This study examined 100 healthy adolescents (mean age: 15.7, 55 female, 45 male), who had completed a self-administered questionnaire for my previous research, assessing their nighttime behaviors and had provided a first morning urine sample to assess their urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) levels. I collected additional information about the self-reported chronotype and weekday and weekend bedtimes of participants, and statistically compared the follow-up questionnaire data to existing measurements of the participants’ weekday aMT6s levels and variables affecting them. Weekday bedtime and chronotype did not significantly predict aMT6s levels, but later bedtime on weekends was associated with significantly lower melatonin levels (11pm-midnight, aMT6s 48.8 ng/mg-creatinine versus after midnight, aMT6s 38.0 ng/mg-creatinine, P = 0.04). While ambient light and weekday sleep habits were not associated with melatonin (P > 0.05), delayed sleep timing on weekends, suppressed melatonin in the study population. This research is the first to examine relationships between behavioral factors and melatonin in adolescents, and, in conjunction with existing data demonstrating a positive association between melatonin and weekend sleep duration, offers a novel perspective into how nighttime behaviors may influence the adolescent circadian system.

AN EXAMINATION OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS FOR SELECTIVE ATTENTION IMPAIRMENT DETECTION IN MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PATIENTS
Rachel Catherine Polcyn
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

Neuropsychological evaluations are essential to the recovery process for traumatic brain injury patients. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to the improvement of such evaluations. This research paper aims to address the question of how one can modify the Stroop Test, a common evaluation of selective attention, to improve its ability to detect selective attention impairments in traumatic brain injury patients. Approximately 60 College of Charleston students enrolled in Introductory Psychology and between the ages of 16 and 24 were administered a modified version of the Stroop Test. Of the 60 participants, 10 had a brain injury history or other source of selective attention impairment which qualified them for the patient group. The test was administered individually to the participants in thirty minute sessions, and then the data was analyzed using the Analysis of Variance test to determine the researcher’s success in creating a more difficult and more accurate version of the Stroop Test. The patient and control groups did not significantly differ on the Stroop Test (t(118) = -0.90, p = 0.37) or the existing Modified Stroop Test (t(118) = -1.22, p = 0.23). However, there was a significant difference between patient and control group performance on the researcher’s modification of the test (t(118) = -2.79, p = 0.006). Therefore, the researcher was successful in creating a test which distinguished patients from control group participants. Future research with a larger patient group would help verify these results.

COMPARATIVE STUDY ABOUT THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF ANXIETY IN TEENS BETWEEN 14 AND 18 YEARS OLD FROM 3 SCHOOLS OF MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA
Ana Maria Botero
Colegio San Jose de Las Vegas, Medellin, COLOMBIA

The adolescence is a transition from kids to adults that generates uncertainty and anxiety. In 2010, a research called Causes of anxiety in teens between 15 and18 years old of the Colegio San José de Las Vegas was developed. In 2012, it was extended to identify the causes and the physical and psycho-social effects of anxiety in the referred school and in 2 other institutions with different characteristics, in order to establish a diachronic and synchronic comparison and finally generate alternatives for anxiety control. <br><br>The methodology included the design of four types of questionnaires about causes and one related to anxiety effects (661 in total). The results were classified in emerging categories and charted comparatively by age, gender, grade and socio economic stratum (as defined by the Colombian state). Four focal groups were developed in order to propose solutions for anxiety control. <br><br>The results showed that the main anxiety causes are Fear of failure and Rules, duties and responsibilities to society, school and home. The most common effects are Specific alterations. Additionally, the main psyco-social effects are The establishment of interpersonal relations. <br><br>As a final result, the 54% of the students considered that The school does not address topics related to anxiety and that social problems (use of alcohol, drugs and eating disorders) are related with the anxiety, because teenagers use them as an escape way from their problems. Besides, the diachronic study revealed that anxiety increase a 6% (2010 vs. 2012), in the cause with higher percentage Making mistakes

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON CELL PHONE ADDICTION AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA: FACTORS PREDICTING CELL PHONE ADDICTION
Rachel Hyojin Kim
Ames High School, Ames, IA

This project in its present form is the result of a comparative study among adolescents from the United States and South Korea about factors that predict cell phone addiction. With both countries having one of the highest cell phone penetration rates in the world, through a comparative study, the initial idea was to see if cultural differences had an impact on factors that predict cell phone addiction. <br><br>Surveys were given to 170 American and 170 South Korean adolescents to predict factors of cell phone addiction: self-esteem, social interaction anxiety, impulsiveness, nationality, gender, number of extracurricular activities, length of cell phone ownership, and type of cell phone (smartphone or not). <br><br>Data was analyzed to observe the correlation between such independent variables and the dependent variables of level of cell phone addiction and amount of time used on the cell phone. The data collected was analyzed through linear regression and independent sample t-tests by the SPSS (version 19.0) program. Results show that the type of cell phone owned, gender, impulsiveness, and length of cell phone ownership are statistically significant factors that predict cell phone addiction in both countries, with self-esteem only being statistically significant in the United States. Although results show that American adolescents have higher levels of cell phone addiction than South Korean adolescents, South Korean adolescents spend more time on their cell phones than American adolescents. Considering that low self-esteem is statistically significant in predicting cell phone addiction among American adolescents, this explains that although American adolescents spend less time on their cell phones than South Korean adolescents, they have higher levels of cell phone addiction.

ASSESSING THE MAGNOCELLULAR THEORIES OF THE FLASH-LAG EFFECT AND DYSLEXIA
Stephen Thomas Kranich
West Anchorage High School, Anchorage, AK

The flash lag effect (FLE) occurs when one perceives a moving object ahead of a still object while in reality the two objects are aligned (Nijhawan, 2002). One explanation of the FLE is that the magnocellular pathway, which processes motion, transmits action potentials to the thalamus 7-10 ms faster than the parvocellular system, which processes color and detail (Maunsell & Gibson, 1992). A deficit in the magnocellular pathway has also been hypothesized to be the root cause of developmental dyslexia (e.g. Stein & Walsh, 1997; Vidyasagar & Pammer, 2009; Chouake, Levy, Javitt, & Lavidor, 2012), but the topic is still highly controversial. In the current experiment, participants reported their gender, age, and whether or not they had dyslexia before viewing 10 FLE illusions. Five of these were designed to stimulate the magnocellular pathway, and five were designed to minimize magnocellular processing by reducing contrast between the moving object and the background, as well as adding visual noise to the background (Chappel & Cullen, 2010). Data collection is ongoing, but currently, the data support the magnocellular theory of the FLE. The data do not, however, support the magnocellular theory of dyslexia, suggesting that this theory is flawed.

DIGITIZING MANIPULATIVES WITH RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED USERS
Sara Manshad
Arrowhead Park Early College High School, Las Cruces, NM

Abstract<br><br>This research presents a comparison between traditional classroom manipulatives (MathWindow) against the new radio frequency identification (RFID) digital manipulatives (magnetic wooden cubes with RFID tags). The goals of this research are aimed at allowing the user to quickly, independently and correctly construct numbers, words, and mathematical expressions by putting together and manipulating a set of trackable objects, while reinforcing reading of Braille. This new set of manipulatives are tracked via an RFID reader and software which attempts to reason with user input. The results of the NASA Task Load Index (TLX), a subjective workload assessment, against fifteen blind users showed the new RFID digital manipulatives provided users with significantly less workload demand (65%) than traditional manipulatives. Task completion times were significantly faster (61% faster) than traditional manipulatives. The new manipulatives also had a higher accuracy rate (13%).

THE EFFECT OF EMOTICON STIMULI ON HUMAN FACIAL MUSCLE ACTIVATION AND SOCIAL EVALUATION USING ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY: A NOVEL DETERMINATION
Abigail Claire Orlando
Eastchester High School, Eastchester, NY

When we see another person smiling or frowning, we automatically mime their facial expression. This effect is known as facial mimicry. In digital conversations we tend to use schematic representations of faces, known as emoticons, to convey emotion. Do we mimic these simulated facial expressions during digital conversation? Phase 1 addressed these physiological responses by recording facial movements while participants were exposed to happy, neutral and sad emoticon stimuli. Electromyography (EMG) was used to record minute changes in the electrical activity of select facial muscles. Phase 1 found that there was significant activation of: zygomaticus major when viewing happy emoticons (p < 0.001); corrugator supercilii when viewing sad emoticons (p < 0.001). These findings led to Phase 2, which asked the question: does the usage of emoticons in digital communication affect our social evaluations and decision-making? Subjects interacted with four different simulated users via chat windows and then evaluated each on likeability, trustworthiness and compatibility. The users who included emoticons throughout their conversations were rated significantly higher (p < 0.001) in all of the aforementioned social evaluation categories. This is the first study to detect physiological responses to the emoticon using EMG and subsequent social evaluations of emoticon users.

THE EFFECTS OF EQUINE-ASSISTED THERAPY ON THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF AUTISTIC ADULTS
Sarah Rebecca Ruthen
Briarcliff High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD’s) are among the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders diagnosed in the United States each year. Equine-assisted therapy is a treatment strategy in which an occupational therapist uses a horse as a modality for the patient to respond to the therapeutic effects of the horse. This study aimed to see if an intervention of equine-assisted therapy would improve the social functioning of autistic adults.<br><br>Methods: Ten participants with ASD’s engaged in a thirty-minute intervention every Sunday for a period of eight weeks. This intervention included riding and engaging in animal husbandry. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was administered pre and post intervention to the guardians of the participants. <br><br>Results: Participants were observed to have better focus and moods when engaged in riding than when off the horse. A paired two-sample t-test was used to analyze the data from the SRS. All participants scored in the severe range during pre and post, indicating severe social impairment. The p-value was .00001 (p=0.0), indicating a significant improvement from pre to post intervention.<br><br>Conclusions: Equine-assisted therapy may have a positive effect on the social functioning of autistic individuals. More comparative research must be conducted with a larger pool of participants to confirm the validity of this research.

DYNAMIC FACE PROCESSING IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS
Aspen Kennedy Hopkins
Utah County Academy of Sciences, Orem, UT

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are developmental disorders that cause social impairments, communication difficulties, and abnormal repetitive behaviors, which contribute to difficulties integrating into typical society. Previous studies have demonstrated atypical face processing in ASD using either static images (e.g., still pictures) or real-time dynamic video images. However static images present an unnatural condition that is not easily recognized, while real-time dynamic images may move too quickly for easy processing in ASDs. This study examined how face processing of adolescents with ASD (ASD group) compared to that of typical adolescents (TYP group) when the dynamic images shown shifted gradually rather than in real-time. It also compared the perceived confidence in the emotion selections of each group. The task examined six emotions—anger, surprise, happy, sad, disgust, and fear—using a computer program called Facemorph, which displayed a series of faces shifting from neutral to emotive. The correct emotions were not noted for each trial. I hypothesized that those with ASD would recognize basic neutral or positive emotions better than negative emotions, and that the level of recognition would significantly differ from the TYP group. Final results suggested that the slower dynamic faces were easier to comprehend for ASD than in previous studies using other stimuli. Happiness was perfectly recognized by both groups. Surprise, a neutral emotion, was easier for the ASD group to recognize in contrast to the TYP group, while disgust was easier for the TYP group to identify than it was for the ASD group. The results of the study supported the hypotheses made.

In the era we live in, life revolves around social Medias that reflect the echo of the communities around the globe. People use their computers; work their phones and tablets daily talking about anything and everything just for the sole purpose of socializing. So I thought why not use these portals and social Medias to help providing solutions for our environment daily problems and dilemmas.<br><br>Hence the idea to create GREENECHO.ORG!<br><br>Our mission is to approach all the environmental issues through the shares and exchanges about specific subjects. Create discussions and initiatives that will help answer and resolve any type of environmental problem no matter how small it is through our active users and professionals.<br><br>GREENECHO.ORG is divided in both a web portal and social media.<br><br>The web portal will hold passive sections with links to articles, past Q&A(s), etc … whereas the social media part will be more interactive where users can share opinions, ask questions, look for help, share inventions, ideas, etc…<br><br>In order to achieve the above, we had to buy the domain and host it. Design and create the structure of the website, gather data, select the best friendly format to present it. Select colors, work on graphic, finalize the site and publish it. I also searched for the best social engine available in the market and customize it to my website’s feel and look and the user’s needs for best interaction.<br><br>Once the above is achieved, “GREEN ECHO” will become the best portal to turn too in order to find all the information needed about anything related to environment

LEARNING COMPREHENSION THROUGH AUDITORY AND VISUAL PRESENTATION
Jane Irene Merrick
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

The project’s purpose was to find whether the presentation of a short story through hearing (audio recording) or sight (text slides) provided better learning comprehension. <br><br>The experiment had three groups, with the independent variable being the presentation form and the dependent variable being survey results. The control group was given text slides to read with the audio recording, meaning the control group was exposed to both presentation styles. The second group was given only the audio recording to listen to. The last group was given just the text slides. After watching or listening to the story participants of each group were asked to fill out a survey consisting of ten questions concerning learning comprehension, and one question asking for the participant’s gender. The surveys were scored (one point for each correct answer). Surveys with the highest score showed which style of presentation was most effective.<br><br>Results show that the group with both presentation styles scored the highest. This test appealed to both auditory and visual learners. The T test showed that the difference between just auditory presentation and just visual presentation (with auditory scoring higher) was not statistically significant. Furthermore, although females scored higher than males in both just visual and just auditory presentation, only the visual presentation difference was statistically significant. Males, although scoring slightly higher on the combination presentation but not statistically significant enough, preferred the presentation of both audio and video.

THE SQUARE BASED PARADIGM: A NEWLY INVENTED METHOD FOR FASTER SPELLING WITH BRAIN WAVES (YEAR III)
Ryan Matthew Shih, Kevin Shih
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, FL

Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that enables an individual to interact with his environment using brainwaves. BCI visual spellers work when the user focuses on a target character and counts every time that target flashes. <br><br> <br><br> The goal of BCI visual speller research is to create a paradigm which achieves maximum spelling accuracy in the least time. Last year, the researchers compared two paradigms, the row-column paradigm and the checkerboard paradigm (CBP), and found that the CBP was more accurate. This year, the researchers compared the CBP to a new paradigm created by the researchers, the square based paradigm (SBP). <br><br> <br><br> Twenty control and three ALS subjects attempted spelling “FAT~PHOENIX” and “WAS~GRUMBLY.” Classification-flash-number, spelling time, characters-per-minute, accuracy, paradigm preference, and visual analogue score were recorded. Control subjects using CBP achieved 96% accuracy and required an average of 332 seconds to spell the target sentence while subjects using SBP achieved 95% accuracy and required 303 seconds. Although average flash count for SBP (10) was higher than CBP (8) (p<0.05), the SBP’s higher flash count gave subjects more chances to successfully select their target in less time. Based on a 10-point visual analogue scale, subjects found CBP less challenging compared to SBP (3.2 vs. 4.5; p<0.05). Analysis of preliminary ALS data demonstrates comparable results to control subjects.<br><br> The hypothesis was supported as the SBP matched the CBP for accuracy and was about 10% faster in speed overall, making the SBP an improvement over the CBP.

Introducing coral reef to school age children is very important if expect them to have awareness of saving it. Children usually learn about it in the rigid environment of a classroom. We need to find a fun, effective and flexible way to do that to compliment this classroom learning. The current study is aimed at testing the effectiveness of newly develop card game (KTR) to introduce coral reef. With this card game, children are introduced to coral reef while having fun playing the card game. Two experiments were conducted with children familiar (island children) and not familiar (city children) with marine habitat. In each location, the group was randomly assigned into 3 groups, i.e. playing group, reading group, and reading-playing group. It was hypothesized that playing group will learn as much as or better than the reading group and the reading-playing group will perform best. The result confirmed part of the hypothesis, that the playing group learn as much as the reading group, which suggests that children learn as much through a fun card game. Because of its portability (can be played almost anywhere-anytime), KTR can become important compliment to classroom learning.

BASIC HEALTH, CLASSIC TRUTH! BEHAVIOR ADJUSTMENT SUGGESTED BY THE IDENTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONS: A NOVEL IDEA FOR HEALTHCARE
Hio Teng Wong, Cheng In Chao
Keang Peng School, Macao, MACAU

In 2012, Macau has been ranked the second highest life expectancy in the world. It is generally believed that prevention is better than cure in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), many approaches of which have been popular among residents in Macau as primary healthcare. We aimed to find out a way to improve our health by behavior adjustment that is based on the nine constitutions, one being natural and acquired disposition, classified by TCM.<br><br>In 2012, 1109 voluntary students from a Macau school, which is one of Macau’s secondary school, completed two questionnaires. One of them is used to define participants’ constitution and was published by China Association of Chinese Medicine; while the other was designed by us in order to study the correlation between constitutions and behaviors. The results showed that eight abnormal constitutions and the control, the Normal Constitution, are significantly different (p<0.05) in behaviors. Significant positive and negative correlations (p<0.1) were between constitution and behavior pattern. Furthermore, constitution was significantly different (p=0.000) in age, grade and gender. The younger and male accounted for high percentage of Normal Constitution.<br><br>To conclude, there is a significant correlation between behaviors and constitutions, which sheds light on a low-cost primary healthcare system by simply modifying behaviors under the trend of population aging. Furthermore, the constitution questionnaire used is proved a practical way of assessing the constitution of a population and of detecting differences in subgroups of the population.

MAGICIAN OR SCIENTISTS? DIDACTIC COMIC FOR SCIENCE DIFUSSION
Ricardo Marquez Catzalco, Angel Ruiz Mendoza
Universidad del Valle de Mexico, Puebla, MEXICO

This prototype of scientific comic book has the purpose to spread the science to young people, and at the same time, to make them get interested using colloquial language and images that demonstrate different theories. We started with one prototype of comic book, in this first one we used “Einstein” and distributed between high school students, after they read this comic, we applied an opinion poll to realize the impact of our comic book, between these questions, we asked what was their favorite subject and the hardest subject for them, in both cases they answered “Math”, so, for our next prototype, we use as theme, “algebra”.<br><br>The project started with the question of why is important the science diffusion? It is believed that young people are not interested in a scientific vocation because they do not have had an interesting experience and teachers have not been able to interest students to science. Using the abilities of the team members, it was devised a comic book, it is known that making science interesting would be the solution.<br><br>We applied the comic book to young people in 10th grade and an exam of some problems and questions of algebra .<br><br>In conclusion, it was found that many young people like science, but is difficult to them learn it, so, it must make easy learning methods with the comic book but without science loses his complicity.

The project develop place in the town of Jaltepec, Axapusco State of Mexico, since has noted that migration is one of the factors that have changed the relationships in families of the community lately have increased rates of migrants north the country or abroad, and in every family there is at least one relative who has migrated, therefore this research conducted an analysis of the social situation facing the people of this town, bordering investigating the causes and effects of migration brings them in the family, social, economic and personal.<br><br>We were sampled at 60 people in the population, using a questionnaire of 20 questions using a random sampling. Subsequently, we applied five depth interviews with people who have migrated or will be migrate in their plans, their relatives, wives and children.<br><br>Finally information was supplemented with a genealogy for each informant, and we realized that migration is part of the life projects of people in the community, as the results were satisfactory to test the hypothesis that arose early in the project; migration is caused by the lack of jobs in Mexico and has different effects. <br><br>From the interviews we could notice that the proposed life of the population is associated with migration as a family has at least two migrants, which resulted in abandonment of homes by modifying father figure family relationships because now is the woman who takes the most important decisions, is complicated situation from the children do not assimilate the dual role of mother and rebellious behaviors are manifested.

The purpose of this experiment was to view the capacity for selflessness of a house mouse and use that data to interpret human nature as fundamentally selfish or altruistic. The hypothesis was that the mice would show concern with the needs of other organisms. This investigation was conducted by placing a small, transparent Plexiglas box within a large wooden box and allowing an experimental mouse to roam the large box while another organism was secluded in the Plexiglas box. Data was collected based on time spent by the mouse not secluded in the small box: (a) attempting to free the other organism from the small box, (b) attempting to escape the large box, or (c) doing nothing at all. These forms of time were labeled empathetic time, selfish time, and idle time, respectively. In order to test capacity for compassion toward unrelated species, trials were conducted in which the experimental mice were given a 25 minute opportunity to show concern for another house mouse, a dwarf hamster, a brown anole lizard, and a fake mouse. The data reflected a mostly selfish trend on the part of the mice, as they spent a great majority of their time trying to escape or being idle rather than trying to help their, “friend.” Furthermore, when compassion was displayed, an overwhelming majority was directed at the organism of the same species. This indicates that mice are fundamentally selfish and that their very similar human counterparts are much the same.

A common problem for students is to memorize and comprehend which results how test scores and low self-steam. This research examines whether the color of the text affects the memorization and comprehension on secondary students. The problem to be solved via typing texts in colors other than the ordinary black such as green, red and blue? These colors were chosen because of the visual receptors in the human eye. The experiments were conducted on 600 boys and 600 girls aged 18 to measure their memorization and comprehension abilities. The subjects read the text in different colors. The results of the control group were compared with the results of the three experimental groups. For the short-term memory, the results were as follows: males were significant level 0.013 and females were significant 0.000. For the long-term memory, the results were as follows: males were significant 0.017 and females were significant 0.004. The red color is significant in all the memorizing tests so it is the best color for memorizing. For comprehension, the results were as follows: males were significant 0.000 and females were significant 0.003. The green color is significant in comprehension in males and the blue color is significant in females. This study helps students to memorize and comprehend texts better. It also helps those with learning disabilities.

AN EXTENSIVE EFFECTIVENESS COMPARISON OF THE TRADITIONAL AND THE INQUIRY-BASED TEACHING METHODS

Educators, throughout centuries, have had the task of determining which teaching method represents a lasting impact on a students’ overall learning process. Based on this, the investigators formulated a methodology to compare the traditional and the inquiry-based teaching methods. The procedure consisted of finding two groups of 15 male students from the ages of 13-14 years old. Then the investigators selected a certified teacher (with a minimum requirement of a masters degree) who had a complete understanding of both teaching methods. In one class she used the inquiry-based teaching method and in the other the direct instruction method. After taking the first class, each student was given a quiz the following day. These quizzes were not announced in order to avoid any other variables. This same process was repeated a third day of class and the methods were inverted for each class. Contrary to the previous year’s investigation, a comprehensive statistical analysis was implemented by calculating the average, total summation, standard deviation, median, mode, range and variance of the results. The results portray that the inquiry-based teaching method is the most beneficial. The total average quiz scores per method for the inquiry-based method were higher than that of the direct one, 8.233 and 6.433 respectively, thus demonstrating a general tendency for higher success rates. The fluctuation between the traditional classes’ score (3.867) and the inquiry-based classes’ score (9.000) was too inconsistent. It could be concluded that the inquiry-method has a wider audience appeal and consistency rate.

THE POWER OF MUSIC IN THE HUMAN MIND
Belmary Figueroa, Marlene Rivera-Martinez
Jose Rojas Cortes High School, Orocovis, PUERTO RICO

The problem under study in this research was: What is the effect of different types of music in the retention capacity of high school students? This research is based on scientific studies by researchers working with human behavior, where they use music to enhance learning. These previous investigations helped to formulate the following hypothesis: If randomly selected high school students are exposed to observe different elements such as words, numbers and images while listening different types of music; then, pop music will stimulate their retention capacity. High school students were chosen at random from tenth to twelfth grades to participate in the investigation. Each participant was given a Human Informed Consent Form for parents to authorize their participation in the research. Twenty words were projected on a screen for a period of 3 minutes while they listened pop music. Then the words were covered and the participants were asked to write in a worksheet the words they remembered, for a period of two minutes. The same was done using a worksheet with numbers and another worksheet with images while students listened pop music. This whole process was done while students listened ballad music. The data obtained from the students worksheets while listening different types of music was analyzed using the mathematical formula average. The hypothesis was rejected because high school students showed more retention capacity with ballad music instead of pop music. This research is very helpful because students will know which strategies to use to improve their retention capacity.

BIRTH OF A REVOLUTION: A GLOBAL MODEL FOR FORECASTING POLITICAL INSTABILITY
Abhishek Nayar, Stephen Kim
Edina High School, Edina, MN

A revolution is defined as a fundamental change in the political and social institutions of a society, often accompanied by violence, cultural upheaval, and civil war. Inspired by the self-immolation of one cart vendor in Tunisia, a wave of revolutions swept the world in 2010/2011. No country was left unscathed, from the Occupy Wall Street protesters right here in America, to the gun-toting revolutionaries in Libya and Syria. Inspired by these revolutionaries, we asked a simple question- Is it possible, or is there some way, to quantify just what it is that leads a state into a revolution? And once you find these causes, or factors say, is there a way you can predict how close any country is to critical civil unrest at any given time? <br><br>A simple looking question that proved to be extremely difficult, we found that no revolution is as spontaneous as it seems, but that there are a set of underlying factors present in almost every one that – when they hit a tipping point – cause a revolution. Our goal was to create a user-friendly, interactive model that would be able to predict how much civil unrest was present in any country and we successfully prototyped this. Our ultimate aim is to be able to link our model to a real-time data source (such as a world monitoring service) so that we can see levels of unrest updating live, as events unfold. Join us, as we try and find out just what births a revolution.
