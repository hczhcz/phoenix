THE PHYSICS OF EXTERNAL FIELDS ON MAGNETIC GRANULAR MATERIAL
Daniel Davis Wood III
Seminole High School, Sanford, Fl, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to obtain information concerning the effects of external magnetic fields on granular material. <br><br> The experiment was done using granular magnetite of a known particle size. The samples were then experimented upon using a cylinder containing two copper coils, which were supplied through a computerized voltage source. A camera, used in conjunction with a computer, was used to capture images of the samples for analysis. The data in question was of the growth in height and diameter of the sample piles, which were graphed to show any patterns. <br><br> The height grew in spikes, beginning at the peak of the pile and eventually forming at the base. This was compared to the normal force instability in ferrofluids and was explained for the solid in terms of its internal magnetization. The diameter of the sample also grew in steps after a critical field, with slight growth before the critical field. The slight growth was explained as being particles sliding down the slope of the pile. The magnetic field was questioned to have changed the coefficient of static friction, which would in turn affect the sliding process of the particles, but was proven to have no effect on the coefficient at all. <br><br> The experiment will be continued; this time using a lens system to see the instabilities and the sliding processes. Also a better camera system will be used, a system that is not allowed to be moved, allowing for a fixed measurement to calibrate all data with.<br><br>

MEMS: OPTIMIZATION OF A NOVEL APPLICATION OF KOH SILICON ETCHING TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF SINGLE DEGREE OF FREEDOM OPTICAL MICROMIRRORS
Steven Christopher Seidel
Astronaut High School, Titusville, FL, US

The objective is to fabricate functional optical micromirrors using simple micromachining steps. It is proposed that this can be achieved by creating an array of 32 mirrors with varied parameters and by using PR as a bonding agent to allow three-dimensional flexibility in a single process sequence.<br><br> To fabricate the mirrors, first a process is established to produce the desired mirrors. This process is a series of lithography, etching, and deposition steps. Next, a mask is designed. This mask, through photolithography, defines the structure of the MEMS device.<br><br> Once the mirrors are fabricated, they are tested for desirable mechanical properties. The mirror must have a flat surface and it must respond consistently to an applied voltage. The specifications that produce predictable mirror behavior will be used in future research.<br><br> Due to unforeseeable obstacles the process is not yet complete. The mirror structures are etched and the wafer bonding and gold deposition techniques are established. From the in-process structures, it is evident that mirrors from 300 to 500 microns on a side have optimum shape. Equipment characterization will allow the obstacles to be overcome and the mirrors to be completed and tested, meeting the objective.<br><br> With funding established, future research possibilities will be significant. Large micromirror surfaces can be utilized for telescope mirrors, digital projectors, micro spectrophotometers, and countless other things. More importantly the novel combination of varied mirror geometries with PR bonding allows three-dimensional parameter flexibility, a departure from the traditional wafer processing paradigm.

THE NEWTONIAN PHYSICS OF ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITIVE PROPULSION
Evan Eric Frank
DuPont Manual High School, Louisille, Kentucky, U.S.A.

Nearly all methods of producing thrust or motion require the use of some form of propellant or need moving parts. Using neither, a relatively new NASA patent (6,317,310) accomplishes this task by applying high DC voltage at low current to Asymmetrical Capacitor modules. The goal of my experiment was to construct and analyze a working Asymmetric Capacitor module to determine the acceleration, thrust, and efficiencies of the module. I then hoped to compare the Asymmetrical Capacitor to other forms of ion propulsion.<br><br>Information was gathered to develop plans for my experiment and procure the materials that would be needed to produce and power the device. A successful proof of concept model was made using the outline of the NASA patent and experimentation was then conducted with the device suspended on a tethered pendulum. Able to observe the physical properties of the device I eventually designed and constructed a linear test setup that allowed for time motion studies to observe the velocity and acceleration of the devices. From these studies I was able to calculate the amount of thrust produced by the device and in turn power produced and efficiencies. <br><br>Even though the device was inefficient (0.09%), and thrust produced by the device was miniscule (42.8mN, 0.015 lB), the efficiency proved to be 53 times greater than the Xenon ion propulsion system [XIPS] used by NASA today. This research confirmed a test method and uncovered information about devices that may prove to be a novel form of propulsion in years to come.<br><br>

Purpose: To investigate how the use of different color light sources would affect the amount of energy absorbed by the emitted electron. In addition, this project tried to determine the cutoff voltage for the light sources used.<br><br>Hypothesis: The color of the light would affect the amount of energy produced during the photoelectric effect, as the light sources get closer to the purple and ultraviolet ranges.<br><br>Procedure: 1. We discussed how to improve upon last year’s project.<br><br>2. We obtained a vacuum gauge.<br><br>3. We constructed grids with PVC pipe and thin wire<br><br>4.

THE EFFECT OF SALINITY ON THE PRODUCTION AND DURATION OF ANTIBUBBLES
Michael J. Pizer
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, U.S.A.

This project investigated the effects of salinity on the production and duration of antibubbles. Antibubbles are spherical air envelopes surrounding a liquid. Usually they are in a liquid that is the same as that inside the layer of air. Generally, antibubbles are made by dropping small quantities of a liquid into a large container of that same liquid. Air gets trapped between and eventually encompasses the droplet to form an antibubble.<br><br> In order to conduct research, I created an apparatus to drop similar sized droplets of solutions of varying molarities into a large graduated cylinder that had a density gradient. The density gradient was formed by placing a large mass of NaCl at the bottom of the graduated cylinder. The base solution was made of 2 mL detergent/1000 mL water. The antibubbles of varying molarities and therefore densities would sink and float at specific depths. I determined the duration of the antibubbles made from various concentrations of several salts.<br><br> The data that was collected had a large range, but after averaging the durations, the results clearly demonstrated that as the molarity of the antibubble solution increases, the duration decreases.<br><br> Further studies would involve testing antibubbles made with different types of salts and with different solutions. Practical applications of antibubbles include using them to monitor underwater currents or to deliver chemicals to a specific location in a body of water.<br><br>

ANTIGRAVITY ION PROPULSION
John Michael Blankenship
Westover High School, Albany Georgia, USA

Continued explorations in science, particularly manned space exploration, will demand new and revolutionary propulsion energy sources, more powerful and safer than the chemical/mechanical systems utilized in shuttles today. One such source of new propulsion energy that promises to work in the vacuum of space may be found in the 1928 through 1950 work of the American physicist Thomas Townsend Brown.<br><br>The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether a predictable net directional force can be produced when a dielectric material of a capacitor is subjected to high voltage. <br><br>In this experiment, low efficiency, high voltage, air-gap capacitors (“lifters”) were constructed using positively charged corona wires suspended over sheets of negatively charged aluminum foil collectors supported on lightweight balsa frames. The experiment tested the effects of differing corona wire materials and diameters as well as differing “lifter” weights and designs. Variable voltages were applied from 10,000 to 35,000 volts DC.<br><br>The hypothesis was supported that these geometric dissimilar materials when charged with high voltages will produce a leakage of ions that would propel the “lifter” into the air.<br><br>The basis of this phenomenon, though not completely understood, is under study by NASA and several major universities. Ion propulsion may be the propulsion technology of the future.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE STEAM PRODUCTION IN, AND EXTINCTION LIMITS OF, STEADY AND ACOUSTICALLY-STRAINED COUNTER-FLOW DIFFUSION FLAMES
Amy Ramesh Kabaria, Richlands High School
Richlands, VA, USA

The focus of this study was to observe and analyze the behavior of counter-flow diffusion flames (CFDFs) with specific regard to the amount of steam production in the flame and the effect of input flow oscillation on the extinction of an ethylene CFDF. An oscillatory opposed jet burner (OOJB) was used to create the CFDFs. To measure the steam production in the flame, a diode laser/detector system was used to observe a hydrogen flame. However, due to complications caused by the inadequacy of the laser, the steam production investigation was sidelined early. For the oscillation experiment, an ethylene flame was formed first under steady conditions by flowing ethylene, preset at a fized flow rate and diluted with nitrogen, against air. The nitrogen and air flow rates were increased until extinction of the flame. After collecting steady extinction data, oscillations were introduced, originally as incrementing voltages at four low frequencies. The primary results verified the hypothesis of a linear decline of normalized extinction limits as frequency increased. However, higher frequencies that were later imposed revealed that the flame, after growing weaker in the frequency range of 0 to 250 Hz and sensitive from 200 to 500 Hz, regained strength beyond a frequency of 500 Hz. The contributions of this project are two-fold. First, ethylene flame strength data was gathered. Second, the findings of this project will offer insight and understanding of acoustic straining effects on quasi-steady combustion - an understanding important to the development of airbreathing scamjets and hypersonic travel.<br><br>

MEASURING THE SPEED OF SOUND IN A FLOWING SOAP FILM
Sarah Maureen Harrison
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville, Virginia, United States

A soap film consists of a thin layer of water sandwiched between two layers of surfactant hydrocarbons (soap molecules) whose hydrophilic heads are bonded to the water and hydrophobic tails stick out from the surface of the film. Because a soap film is extremely thin compared to its surface area, it can be considered a 2-dimensional fluid. The speed of transverse waves (Vs) that a film will support is an important parameter controlling the mechanical properties of a soap film. This is effectively the speed of sound in two dimensions because as soap film speeds reach Vs shock waves develop in flow past an obstacle. Vs is given by <br><br> Vs= squareroot(2t/dh)<br><br>where Vs=speed of transverse waves in fluid, t=surface tension of fluid, d=density, and h=thickness.<br><br>I built a soap film tunnel using a design of Gharib(3) on which I created moving films and determined Vs by measuring these parameters. I ran the film tunnel at five different speeds to test whether mechanical properties of the flow might change the thickness h, and therefore change Vs. I found that over the whole range of speeds the thickness of the film remained constant and thus, the speed of sound in the film was also constant, with a mean value of 17.67 m/s. After this experiment was completed, I obtained a paper by Gharib and Beizaie(6), where similar measurements are carried out using soap solutions with lower concentrations of surfactants. A comparison of the data shows that my results are consistent with theirs.<br><br>

CAN SUPERCONDUCTORS BE ENHANCED USING FERROMAGNETIC IRON?
William Scott Fairhurst
Lawton Chiles High School, Tallahassee, FL, USA

This Project is the result of trying to determine if certain Superconductors can be enhanced using ferromagnetic iron, and which sample configuration is most effective at enhancing the Superconductor. The idea was to build a magnet assembly, which was placed in a Helium storage Dewar, and then perform the experiment using the Superconducting Magnet. <br><br>Different configurations of Superconductors in proximity of ferromagnetic iron were placed on a probe. The probe, containing each sample, was placed in a magnetic field and kept at 4 degrees Kelvin. The magnetic field was swept up to 0.5 Tesla and changes in resistances of the samples, as the applied field from the magnet stopped Superconductivity, were recorded as they corresponded to the magnetic field. The applied field was then swept to 0.5 Tesla in the negative direction to show a Hysteresis loop that is characteristic of the ferromagnetic iron. <br><br>The results show that the Superconductors were shielded, or enhanced, by the ferromagnetic iron.They remained Superconducting until the applied field reached 0.08 Tesla. A sandwich of lead and iron, and the iron wire with lead solder surrounding it, performed the best, as they stayed in the Superconducting state for the longest time. Applications for the information gained from the experiment include the use of these Type I Superconductors in the construction of larger magnets with the same shielding configuration. They are much cheaper than the Type II Superconductors, and can be shielded to remain Superconducting in a high magnetic field.<br><br>

ABSORPTION OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES USING NATURAL ZEOLITES
Vanessa Anne Spini
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach Oregon, USA

Disposal of radioactive wastes has become a problem of public concern since use of nuclear reactors (civilian and military) became more widespread. Atomic bomb testing in the 1950's created soils that were unable to produce food safe for consumption. A method of 'sequestering' radioactive contaminants is needed. The mineral zeolite is well known for its absorption properties involving cations (including radioisotopes).<br><br> This research used two naturally occurring clinoptilolite zeolites and focused on two issues:<br><br> - the ability of zeolite to absorb and hold strontium-90 in all states of decay<br><br> - zeolite selectivity of specific ions from a multi-element mixture<br><br>Contaminant solutions were run through filters and filtrate collected. Levels of contaminants in pre and post-filtered solutions were measured using neutron activation analysis. Both zeolites sequestered strontium isotopes as well as decay series elements (yttrium and zirconium). Strontium was held despite the addition of isotopes of higher charge.

SONOLUMINESCENCE
Samrat A. Amin
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY, USA

Sonoluminescence is the phenomenon by which light fluctuating periodically in relation to a sinusoidal wave in the perceptible electromagnetic spectrum is emitted in the blue region at approximately 480nm owing to the implosion of a gaseous cavity in a resonant pulsating liquid created by an ultrasonic field of acoustic waves from piezo-electric transducers. High frequency acoustic waves were driven into various liquids and compounds containing a gaseous cavity in the range of 25-28 kHz with diverse factors of temperature and dissolved gas. Single-Bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) as well as acoustic cavitation was observed to transpire at 27.35 kHz in degassed water, a frequency significantly higher than most producing SBSL in similar studies done in the past. While luminescence in Ethyl and Methyl alcohol has yet to be observed, the data provides proof of relation between the production of sonoluminescence with the chemical properties and temperature of the medium in which the gaseous cavity resides, as well as the relation between the driving frequency of the ultrasonic field and the atmospheric pressure at which the experiment is performed. The data also proves that the period of luminescence within the cavity acts in relation with these factors – All important data that may be related to the study of low-energy fusion as a result of the possible extreme temperatures created inside the bubble during sonoluminescence.

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE THEORY BEHIND HYPERSONIC SOUND
Brooks W. Willig
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX, USA, 76901

This project was conducted to experiment with the theory behind HyperSonic Sound. In the late 1800’s, Herman von Helmholtz experimented with a pipe organ to explore Tartini tones. He discovered that while playing two tones, he heard four tones. The new tones he heard were produced from the interaction with the non-linear properties of air. The frequencies of the new tones were at the added and the subtracted points of the two fundamental tones. HyperSonic sound is the generation of audible tones from the subtraction of two tones at frequencies above the hearing range. Tests were conducted, by projecting two different frequency tones through loudspeakers and analyzing the tones received by the microphone. The analysis showed the presence of a third tone. When the tones were fed directly into the analyzer, no other tones were detected. This indicated that transmission through the air is necessary to produce the subtracted frequency tone. While the test equipment was unable to produce and identify sounds above the audible range, the frequencies tested were at the maximum operational limits of the equipment. The results showed two tones reacting in air produced a third tone, and that a non-liner medium had to be present in order for the tones to interact. Inventors claim HyperSonic Sound could render conventional loudspeakers obsolete.

THE EFFECT OF STANDING WAVES ON THE DOPPLER EFFECT OF SOUND
William Alexander Goodman
Chantilly High School, Chantilly Virginia, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate if a standing wave can cancel out the Doppler Effect of sound. It is hypothesized that the Doppler Effect created by a moving sound source can be altered or blocked when exposed to the effects of a standing wave. The particuler question is: can a sound wave front slow down another sound wave front? For the procedure, a peizo buzzer was launched along a nylon string at a relatively constant speed. The trajectory of the sound source traveled through an area influenced by the conditions of a standing wave. The sound that was produced was then recorded and analyzed using a Timed Fast-Fourier Transform graph. The major finding was that sound works on the basis of addition so when the “Doppler” waveform is superimposed onto the standing wave, anything that affects the “Doppler” waveform will affect the standing wave as well. This is proof that my hypothesis was incorrect due to the fact that sound is additive; anything that affects one wave form affects the other. I chose this topic for this project because I enjoy science and music. Since sound has certain physical properties that are interesting to me, I decided to choose an experiment based on a topic about sound.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF BENDING LOSS IN OPTICAL FIBER
Jessica Rose Haney
Oakton High School, Vienna, VA, USA

Bending losses are a major cause of inefficiency in fiber optic cables. This experiment had two objectives: (1) to develop and experimental procedure to determine a bending loss parameter and (2) to validate this parameter as part of a theoretical model describing bending loss as a function of radius of curvature.<br><br>First, measurements were made to verify that the laser diode, the power source, was stable and that the experiment was repeatable. It was found that the laser diode would stabilize enough to minimize error, and that the position of the apparatus could be kept constant. A control measurement was obtained before the experiment began and after each successive trial. This verified that the output power measurements for each radius were not adversely influenced by the surroundings. To conduct the experiment, fiber was coiled around the tubes of different, known radii. The output power of the fiber, as theory suggested, was found to decrease as the radius of curvature grew smaller. <br><br>To create a quantitative model to compare the experiment’s results to, it was necessary to characterize the relationship by finding the variation constant. This was done by deriving a theoretical equation of the power output as a function of radius of curvature, and using the middle data point to solve for k. The experimental data closely fits this model.<br><br>The procedure for empirically characterizing a fiber’s bending loss has been demonstrated by this project. It could be applied by engineers needing to characterize the fibers used in various systems.<br><br>

SPECTROSCOPY NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD
Andrew Jared Herron
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown, PA

This project was a comparison of the groove densities of various compact disc media and their application in spectroscopy as low cost alternatives to diffraction gratings. The principle that makes this possible is the grating equation for interference maxima of diffracted light, d(sin ALPHA + sin BETA) = (LAMDA)n (where d is distance between grooves on CD surface, ALPHA is angle of incidence, BETA is angle of diffraction, LAMDA is wavelength, and n is order).<br><br> Media used were CD, CD-R, CD-RW, CD-ROM, laser disk, DVD, DVD-R, and DVD-RW. A He-Ne laser of LAMDA = 632.8nm was set perpendicularly to wall and to CD (mounted via clamp) and directed towards surface of CD, aligned such that the 0th order of interference returns to laser aperture, making ALPHA = 0. Distance between corresponding points was measured and divided by two, which, in conjunction with the distance between wall and CD, was used to find BETA, and therefore d. The above process was repeated with a He-Ne laser of LAMDA = 543nm, using calculated d to solve for LAMDA, thus allowing percent error to be calculated.<br><br> The writable media were the most accurate in both CD and DVD-like media, with the DVD-R showing lowest percent error, 0.01271%, indicating a tolerance of accuracy of +/-0.06902nm. The percent error compares accepted LAMDA and calculated LAMDA = 543.1 nm. The DVD-R had d = 740nm, making it comparable to a 1.35E-3 grooves/nm grating. <br><br> Compact disc media can be used as accurate substitutes for professionally produced reflecting diffraction gratings, especially for schools and students because of accessibility, durability, and low cost in comparison to manufactured gratings. <br><br>

ORBITAL MANUEVERS VIA LUNAR MASCONS
Kyle Brady Winkleman
Franklin County High School, Winchester, Tennessee

Over the years, NASA has conducted several studies on the moon's gravitational field. Apollo, Clementine, and Lunar Prospector produced several maps showing us that the moon's gravitational field varies in intensity. These mass concentrations, or mascons, can be expected to effect lunar probes. The purpose of this project is to see whether these lunar mascons can effect the orbit of a lunar probe in a useful way increasing mission value. (more payload, longer mission, and lower fuel consumption) A model of the moon-mascon system was developed, using a fourth order Runge Kutta Nystrom algorithm, to solve this three body problem. A parametric study was performed to test the effect of the mascon on a probe. Test were performed for different mascon masses, different probe perigees, orbital inclination, and parent body rotation speed. The results of these studies showed that mascons could be used to change probe energy and orbital inclination.

DRAFTING: A STREAMLINE ANALYSIS
Stephen Francis Snow
Patrician Academy, Butler, AL USA

The purpose of this project is to determine how the streamlines of race cars change as they come closer together. Drafting is the aerodynamic effect of two or more race cars getting "in-line" at high speeds to create less air resistance and increase speed. A streamline is the path that air takes around an object. The hypothesis of this project is that streamlines will become straighter as the race cars come closer together.<br><br> Place the cars eight inches apart in the wind tunnel. Turn the wind tunnel on, set a rag on fire, and seal the rag in a pressure cooker. Regulated air from an air compressor is introduced into the pressure cooker and smoke is exhausted through a tube into the wind tunnel to show the streamlines. Take five pictures of the cars at each distance, which starts at eight inches apart and decreases to zero inches apart at two inch intervals. Draw a line across the tops of the cars and use a dial caliper to measure the distance from that line to the bottom of the smoke.<br><br> The cars at eight inches apart averaged 0.662 inches difference in the top of the cars and the bottom of the streamline. At zero inches, they averaged a 0.234 inch drop in the streamline. This reduction in the streamline drop is very significant.<br><br> The conclusion of the project is that the hypothesis was proven to be correct. Streamlines become straighter as race cars come closer together, which reduces air resistance and increases speed.

WHAT IS THE MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY OF DIFFERENT METALS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE TEMPERATURES IN REGARDS TO THE CURIE EFFECT IN A SOLENOID?
Zachary Mason Sandoval
Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, Miami, FL 

The purpose of my current research is to observe if magnetic susceptibility is possible using different metals at different temperatures in regards to further testing the Curie Effect in a Solenoid and to test the wave direction. The result of the experiment to be conducted will prove that metals do conduct magnetic fields at different temperatures based on their metallic type. This research is expanding on other metals like Aluminum, Lead, and Copper to see if this rule is constant. The main devices that will be used (see all material) are: three rectangular 1.5 inch blocks of: Aluminum, Copper, Iron, Lead, and Zinc were tested by sending a magnetic current from a 6 DC Volt. The manipulated temperatures are: room temperature, liquid Nitrogen, and boiling water. <br><br> After completing the 120 tests and analyzing the data points in a IDFA-Intrinsic Data Field Analyzer, a program designed by Dr. Carl Momor, I hope to confer that magnetic susceptibility is possible, metals do react differently based on their metal content, and magnetic waves move in a forwards direction and not forward-upward. In addition, under Liquid Nitrogen conditions, the magnetic waves increased and were not blocked. On the other hand, the tests under the boiling water blocked a significant amount of the magnetic waves, thus proving a new idea behind a past speculated theory of how temperature affects magnetic susceptibility setting a new precedent for the field of magnetic waves.<br><br><br>

NOVEL RESEARCH IN MUSICAL ACOUSTICS: TIBETAN BOWLS
Lukas Vidensky
Masaryk University Brno, Faculty of Science, Kotlarska 2, 61137

Tibetan bowls are fascinating musical instrument, at once for physical and musical points of view. There was very little in-depth research about such instruments, and by reason of my personal interest for them, I have performed some research on these instruments. In the initial observations I have taken an inventory of Tibetan bowls, including information about where they originate from, how local inhabitants use them, how the instruments are manufactured, and how they spread west of Tibet. <br><br>However, the main part of my work deals with a physical description of the instrument. First, I have described how the Tibetan bowls behave and which physical laws can be inferred from this behavior. In this stage I have made numerous measurements and observations of standing-wave patterns on the water surface in the bowl. It illustrates the form of sound and explores how this form depends on the frequency of oscillation, or how it changes with time. I have also made a thorough acoustic spectral analysis that enables to characterize the sound in an accurate and comprehensive way. In particular, this analysis shows the intensity and frequency of the main tone and overtones, the changes of intensity with time (damping), etc. The results I have obtained say a lot about the fundamental laws of acoustic.<br><br>Eventually, it turns out that Tibetan bowls can be successfully used for educational and therapeutic purposes, namely for deep relaxation. <br><br>

GENERATING ELECTRICITY THROUGH WAVES
Amina L. Tugan, Wisconsin Career Academy
Milwaukee, Wsconsin, U.S.A.

This project deals with the generation of electricity that does not pollute our environment and uses natural resources. A majority of electricity produced now pollutes the environment. To generate electricity one needs a magnet and a coil, and one of these should be in motion. To do this, a naturally occurring/moving force is needed. These may include wind, water, and the use of objects already moving, such as cars. So far, many researchers have tried to use wind motion and developed windmills, but these have not been completely successful, because of the unpredictability of wind. Dams, on the other hand, can cause ecological disasters. The wave motion of water as a source of movement can be a potential candidate for this project, because the majority of all water is moving in one way or another. Even a fish swimming in a pond moves the water around it. I decided to make use of the water around me and put my idea into motion. Next I needed to find a way for either a magnet or coil to move. To control a magnet floating in water was far harder than coils. I used a movable solenoid (coils) and fixed magnets and could generate a few millivolts. In conclusion, to produce electricity in an environmentally clean way, we must use the motion found in nature. The wave motion is a good choice, but it needs further investigation in order to produce a large amount of electricity.

A SIPHONED FLOWING SOAP FILM AS A MODEL FOR DENSITY-STRATIFIED FLUID SYSTEMS
Jonathan Jacques Kamler
Townsend Harris HS at City Univ. of N.Y., Queens College Flushing, N.Y., U.S.A.

An experimental apparatus was devised and constructed by the author specifically for this study of fluid behavior. The apparatus houses a unique quasi-two-dimensional flowing soap film, the first to have a completely vertical geometry that is run by a siphon mechanism. The design makes possible the simultaneous modeling and visualization of both stratified density and stratified velocity in straight and curved fluid channels.<br><br> It was shown that the rate at which less dense and more dense fluid regions mix across the interface has a negative correlation with the relative speed of the interface. A critical velocity exists below which mixing increases dramatically. This applies to undersea mineral springs, where flow velocity decreases as the freshwater rises. The critical velocity implies that there is a depth above which severe salinization occurs. Spring water, to remain pure enough for drinking, must be captured at or below this depth.<br><br> It was also observed that slow eddies formed along curves in the soap film. These eddies expand and progress upstream into high flow rate areas, overpowering and halting the mainstream flow. The finding could be relevant to the etiology of coronary disease. The eddy growth and resulting diminution of flow observed in this model suggest a mechanism by which mainstream areas in blood vessels may become highly vulnerable to plaque deposition, leading to accelerated blockage. Future studies can apply these findings to better understand the pathology of blood vessel occlusion.

Sadi Sufi Khan, Cooper City High School
Cooper City, Fl, US

The purpose of this years study is to determine the liquid pressure, temperature, and bjerknes force acting upon a single bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) bubble. Using a previously obtained equation: <br><br>F(x) = 3.89523449*1.09199321^x [0,5]<br><br>F(x) = 0.399771341*X^1.72085909 (5,13.9895833]<br><br>F(x) = -0.141669894406(x^3) + 5.9783952(x^2) - 79.4265852*x + 370.4014385 (13.4895833, 22.2]<br><br>F(x) = 0 (>22.2) Liquid pressure, temperature, and vapor pressure had an inverse relationship with the radius. Pressure, however seemed to decrease as the temperature was increased. The bjerknes force for different equilibrium radii was constant. The bjerknes force for the larger distances was, logically, decreasing. The interesting observation was that the distance was decreasing at a rate of inverse distance squared, much like gravity. The conclusion was that the light emission is a result of different parameters working together, instead of one lone effect. The researcher has proposed a new theory to explain the phenomenon of SBSL. At the point of liquid collapse the researcher hypothesizes that there would be sufficient pressure to create a primordial black hole. An event horizon would form and since the bubble is now expanding again (the sound waves negative pressure), there will be an area of empty space in which Hawking radiation would occur. This can be treated as the light emission. Applications for single bubble sonoluminescence include a possible future energy source, and a laboratory for condensed matter physics.<br><br>

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN HIGH PRESSURE PHASES OF LITHIUM* *PUBLISHED IN 8 NOVEMBER 2002 ISSUE OF SCIENCE MAGAZINE

At ambient conditions, lithium has ordinary metallic properties and assumes a highly symmetric body centered cubic structure. As pressures increase, however, lithium undergoes a series of phase transitions. At 40 gigapascal (GPa), it assumes a cubic polymorph cI16 structure and behaves like a semiconductor. Theoretical predictions correlate superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) of up to 80 K in high-pressure phases, propelling Li into the high-Tc category of superconductors. <br><br>To corroborate these predictions, I use a highly sensitive magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity techniques adapted to diamond anvil cells to identify superconducting transition temperatures. The results show a Tc, critical temperature, increase from 9 K at 24 GPa to 16 K at 33 GPa, yielding a positive pressure derivative of 0.8 K/GPa. From 33 GPa to 80 GPa, the pressure derivative becomes negative as Tc's begin to decline. This unusual pressure dependence of Tc suggests multiple phase transitions consistent with reported X-ray diffraction results. However, the observed values of Tc are lower than those theoretically predicted indicating that more comprehensive theoretical treatments similar to those proposed for metallic hydrogen may be necessary to understand superconductivity in lithium. The peak transition temperatures observed in lithium rival those of sulfur and vanadium (~17 K), elemental solids having the highest Tc's under pressure. <br><br>The discovery of superconducting lithium is an integral step to the attainment of metallic hydrogen because both elements behave comparably under pressure. Metallic hydrogen is predicted to be a room temperature superconductor and, thus, overcomes the most formidable limiting parameter: unfeasibly low critical temperatures.

EFFECT OF STATIC ELECTRICITY ON "REBOUND" OF DROPLETS AGAINST A WATER SURFACE
Hokuto Sunago
Toyama-tyubu high school, Toyama city, Toyama prefecture, Japan

Observing that droplets of Indian ink often survive on the surface of bulk ink, we were interested why the droplets remain on the surface without merging with the bulk.<br><br>In this research, we paid attention to a phenomenon that droplets of water cast out of fine nozzle bounce off water surface. We named this phenomenon as "rebound". To analyze "rebound" reproductively, we made an experimental device composed of a hose connected with a tank placed at the roof of the building.Due to the water pressure, fine drops of water were constantly produced out of the nozzle. We found that a static electricity field prevents the rebound. The static electricity, which prevented rebound, was much weaker than that could be detected by the leaf electroscope. To test whether the polarity of water molecules affects the "rebound", we used non-polar solvent, benzene. The static electricity did not prevent rebound of benzene. Thus, we tentatively conclude that the polarity of water is responsible for the rebound. The study is on going to corroborate the hypothesis.

THE "BLACKBERRY" CLUSTER: THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM AND POTENTIAL MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF GIANT NANOSCALE INORGANIC MOLECULES IN SOLUTION
Brandon Stuart Imber
Commack High School, Commack, New York, United States of America

The development of the giant polyoxomolybdate (POM) family has made the desire to create inorganic molecules on the nanoscale a reality. Physicists have predicted that these molecules would not behave similarly to standard inorganic molecules in solution. Solution behavior of the POM family was studied using the Laser Light Scattering technique. Results show that giant POM molecules will form huge uniform vesicle aggregates, in a rare gradual equilibrium process of about three months. These hollow vesicles have been named the “blackberry” cluster. Heating the solution environment increased the rate of equilibrium, making vesicle formation an endothermic process. The effect of the electrolyte (salt) addition was concentration specific. Moderate concentrations, like those of human blood, resulted in a breakup of the vesicles, a short period of solely individual molecules in solution, followed by a rapid regrowth of “blackberry” aggregates. A model was devised from research on the POM family, that may potentially be used for all nanoscale inorganic molecular aggregates. The balance between electrostatic repulsion forces and attractive Van der Waals forces make the hollow spherical cluster an ideal orientation for giant inorganic ions. The “blackberry” cluster may represent an entirely new universal solute state, and an explanation for the physics behind inorganic aggregation. Finally, it was discovered that the POM series and potentially other nanoscale inorganic molecules may act as ideal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents with anti-tumor qualities. These molecules have the potential to create clearer images than any currently used contrast agents.

IS EATING BLUEBERRY PIE BAD FOR YOU?
Jennifer Anne D'Ascoli
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany, New York, USA

Naringenin and genistein, found in many common foods, are two flavonoids with possible anticancer properties. Because these foods are usually cooked before consumption, this research investigated the effect of heat on the flavonoids’ molecular structure. Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to simulate the cooking process. Three endothermic reactions and a white-yellow to red-brown color change were observed. This color change remained when the flavonoids were dissolved in a solvent (DMSO) for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), indicating that the new color was produced by the individual molecules. This further means that heating must have affected the molecular structures. However, carbon and hydrogen NMR showed no differences between the heated and unheated flavonoid molecular structures. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy data from the heated samples contained extra absorption peaks at longer wavelengths, indicating greater conjugation. This means the heated molecular structures must be different from the unheated ones. These results indicate that cooking flavonoid-rich foods can change the flavonoids’ molecular structure, potentially affecting their anticancer properties.

DIMPLE PATTERN AND SHAPE - IS THE NEW BREED BETTER?
Colin Randall Studyvin
Wells Jr. High School, Greenwood, AR U.S.A

This experiment was designed to test the aerodynamics of several golf balls, each with distinct dimple patterns and shapes. These characteristics are the dominant factor in the aerodynamic performance of a golf ball. In doing this project, the scientist hoped to discern differences in the drag by the use of a fluid tunnel. After observing various vortices and types of drag formed, a definite superior golf ball was found. <br><br>The first step was construction of a fifteen-foot long fluid tunnel to provide laminar flow. Use of plastic fluorescent tube covers, in alternating patterns, separated by square pieces of grid material, provided laminar flow of the fluid.<br><br>After mounting one of the four balls, flow was started through the tunnel. A small pitot tube introduced red coloring for visualization of the turbulence. Digital images were taken when the coloring was caught in this turbulence for comparison and presentation. <br><br>As the images detail, it is clear that one ball outperformed all other golf balls tested. While the other balls created large, loose vortices that indicated more drag, one ball established tight, strong vortices, which suggest reduced drag. Its increased performance is probably the result of its 100% dimple coverage, which eliminates flat spots between dimples. Most balls have flat spots since only about 80% of the surface is dimpled. Flat spots create laminar flow that leads to drag, and thus, the ball does not perform efficiently.<br><br>

DOES THERMAL ENERGY AFFECT AERODYNAMIC FLOW AROUND AN AIRFOIL?
Randall Cody Arnold
Tishomingo County High School, Iuka, Ms, United States

The purpose of this project was to determine if thermal energy affects aerodynamics in airfoils. The first thing needed to do is to design and make a closed circuit wind tunnel. Research must be done in order to construct the design and to form a hypothesis. The next step was to create designs of airfoils in order to do testing. These designs can be original or can be created by designs from actual airfoils. Instrumentation must then be developed in order to determine if thermal energy does affect aerodynamics. The instrumentation used to gather this data are thermometers, pitot tubes, and manometers. Several tests will be completed on the different airfoils to get accurate data. The project did conclude that thermal energy does affect aerodynamics. The "hotter" the temperature the more pressure there was around the airfoil. The "colder" the temperature the less the pressure was around the airfoil. This could prove useful in the fact that planes or other devices that use airfoils could heat airfoils before a flight or cool airfoils off according to their needs and uses.

ROLLING AND MOMENT OF INERTIA
Andreas Andersen
Broenderslev Gymnasium, Broenderslev, Denmark

This project is the result of a comprehensive research of rotation of rigrid bodies in a physical perspective. The purpose of the research was to develop mechanical principles to obtain an understanding and explanation of the physics behind rotation of a rigrid body. My approach to the problem was both theoretical and experimental. The idea was to choose two separate experiments to form the basis for my theoretical research. <br><br>1. A cylinder on an inclined plane: Measurements of position, velocity and acceleration of different cylindrical bodies led to non-intuitive results of the nature of rigrid body rotation. The cylinder experiment motivated the theoretical concepts and formulation of rotational energy and moment of inertia.<br><br>2. The rotation of a polygonal, plane body: By analyzing the rotation around different axis I discovered how a parallel displacement of the rotational axis results in a change of the moment of inertia around the axis. This led to the formulation of The Parallel Axis Theorem. <br><br>To demonstrate the power of the theoretical results I applied the theory to a practical problem:<br><br>3. Predicting the motion of a yo-yo I operated with two different yo-yo models: a) the primitive yo-yo and b) the advanced yo-yo. Using the developed theory together with energy consideration I made precise predictions about the motion of both of the yo-yo´s and showed how the advanced yo-yo will behave like the primitive in a limit. The correctness of these theoretical results was confirmed experimentally.<br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF BOWLING BALL TRAJECTORIES
Daniel Burke Meaders
North Ogden Jr. High, N. Ogden, Utah, USA

The purpose for this experiment is to gain a scientific understanding of the best trajectory for obtaining a strike using bowling balls of different weight. <br><br>A bowling ramp was positioned 24 inches from the start of the pin deck, and straight in line with center head pin. A ball was placed on the ramp with finger holes to the right and thumb hole to the left, so the ball rolled between the holes when it was released. This procedure was repeated ten times each for each of four different weight balls; ten, twelve, fourteen and sixteen pounds, and the pin fall results were recorded. The ramp was then moved one, two, and three inches to the right and the experiment repeated at each location. It was determined from this that the best place for strikes was two inches to the right of center. The ramp was positioned at this spot and the angle of entry changed two, four, six and eight degrees with the procedure being repeated at each offset angle. The resultant angles of the pin and ball were determined. From this information, the initial and final velocities, momentums, and kinetic energies for each were calculated and compared. The data showed that striking the headpin at a two inch offset and a six degree angle was the most effective, increased momentum caused less deflection of the ball resulting in better pin fall, and that there was an average 27 percent kinetic energy loss due to friction, heat and sound. <br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE PLASMA PLUME CREATED BY LASER ABLATION
Kevin Edwin Claytor
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos New Mexico, USA

Probe beam deflection has been previously applied several times as a monitor of laser ablation. In most of these cases, however, the material being ablated was the reason for monitoring the above-surface effects. Here, however, the plasma created by the ablation of the material was under investigation. To this end, a pulsed NdYAG laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm, a pulse length of 4 ns, and an average output of 20 mJ/pulse was used as the excitation source. A CW laser with a wavelength of 670 nm and a 2 mW (nominal) output was used as the probe beam. The samples that were ablated have properties that ranged from metallic and soft (Aluminum) to nonmetallic and brittle (ceramic). Overall, it was shown that the plasma plume is reproducible, within experimental error, not in agreement with one of the references, although the mylar (plastic) waveform was not reproducible at distances over 5 mm. It was also found that the plasma has a lower optical density than that of the ambient air. It was verified that the plasma plume decreased in speed while traveling away from the ablated substrate. According to this data, there are thought to be three main segments to the waves propagating from the surface; a fast, short acoustic wave, a slower plasma wave, followed by an extremely slow heat pulse. This project verified all by experiment. The speeds of the plasma plumes were also determined using the first deflection peak to be around 10 to 13 m/s, with one reaching 16 m/s, in good agreement with references. The amplitude of the plasma plume did not seem to drop as rapidly as did the acoustic or heat pulse, possibly indicating that the plasma formed may have some characteristics of a soliton wave.

MEASURING THERMAL EXPANSION WITH HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY
Joshua David Kalin
Catholic High School, Huntsville, Alabama, USA

The ability of holographic interferometry to accurately measure the thermal expansion of linear solids was investigated. The technique used for the production of these holograms was the Double Exposure, White Light Reflection Technique. This method allows for the hologram to show a change in size by taking an exposure while the object is in its "ground state" and then after it has been warmed and the material has contracted/expanded. The question to be answered in this project: Is this a feasibly easier way to measure the thermal expansion of a stainless-steel rod rather than using other methods? And, is the number of fringes a function of the amount of temperature change? The Double Exposure Interferogram shows the change over time yielded. It would have been conceivable to use a helium neon laser for the holography but in fact there are some very cheap and yet efficient laser diodes that do the same job very well and yield better results. It has been very interesting to see how the laser diode has produced some very good holograms and one could be very pleased with the results. The project was rather successful after the first 4 holograms and after some experience was gathered. The coefficient of thermal expansion for the stainless steel rod was measured and it was found to be relatively accurate.

THE EFFECTS OF MICROSTRUCTURES ON THE EFFICIENCY OF AERODYNAMIC FLIGHT SURFACES
Alexander William Dillard, Bradshaw High School
Florence, AL United States of America

Most species of flies should be unable, by conventional aerodynamic theory, to stay aloft. Interestingly, the top surface of a fly's wing is coated with miniscule hairs aligned in a regular pattern. These sub-micron structures may help account for the extra lift flies create. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between airfoil efficiency and surface structures similar to those found on a fly's wing. Wind tunnel analysis of airfoils with larger, while highly similar structures as those found on fly wings, was utilized in this investigation. Collected data focused on the lift vs. angle of attack properties of the test airfoils. The knowledge gained may later be applied to conventional aircraft, and may prove particularly useful in the development of very small insect-sized reconnaissance drones. The expected affect created by the small wing surface structures was to increases lift. However, based on the size of the structures tested, the data does not support the hypothesis. The presence of fly-like surface structures actually seems to reduce the achieved lift by approximately 10%. The tested surface structures may be significantly too large to evaluate a phenomenon that may be exhibited only at the micron level.

A2BX4 CRYSTALS: THE HOME SECURITY SENSORS
Josue Felipe Martinez
CROEM, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico

This research project looks into using the physical properties of a perovskite-like crystal to improve security systems. By using this A2BX4 crystal capacitor’s ability to sense magnetic fields, a possible security system that uses this crystal as a sensor is explored. The effect in the crystal is a change in voltage on the order of micro volts in the crystal capacitor. <br><br> The crystals were first grown using the slow evaporation method, which was done by mixing and heating the compounds, forming an oversaturated solution, and then allowing for the water to evaporate, leaving crystals behind. The crystals’ dimensions were approximately 1 cm^3 and a mass of roughly 2.5 g. Once the crystals were grown, the capacitors were built by attaching copper wire with silver conductive ink to opposite sides of the crystal. Using a function generator, a sine wave was sent through the capacitor in series with a variable resistor, an inductor and an oscilloscope. The signal was generated at different frequencies in order to find at which frequencies the crystal is most susceptible to magnetic fields. <br><br> The two crystals that produced very significant changes on the sine wave were the Cs2ZnCl4 and Cs2ZnI4 crystals doped with Mn at 0.5% and 1% respectively. The Cs2ZnCl4 crystal worked best at lower frequencies. The Cs2ZnI4 crystal displayed many similarities to the previous crystal only it worked best at higher frequencies, approaching 1 MHz. The effect of doping the crystals with Mn is a change in the frequencies the crystal is susceptible to. The Cs2ZnCl4 crystal doped with Mn at 0.5% shows several phase changes after 270kHz. The crystals show possibilities as sensors because of their significant signal changes.<br><br>

STAGING VERSUS CLUSTERING WHICH SYSTEM IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN CARRYING A GIVEN PAYLOAD TO A GREATER ALTITUDE
Shane Milton Suazo
Hillsdale High School, San Mateo, California, U.S.A.

The object of this project is to compare multi-staging and clustering in terms of maximum altitude in order to determine which is the more efficient system when carrying a given payload. Both theoretical simulation and actual experimentation were used to determine this.<br><br>The project compares the sustained, low-thrust profile of a multi-stage flight to the short, high-thrust profile of a cluster, and the outcome with variations in model mass. It explains with mathematical reasoning why clustering is more effective in launching models with large mass, and why multi-staging is more effective when mass is low.<br><br>To test my hypothesis, I designed and scratch-built four rockets: one 2-stage model, one 2-cluster model, one 3-stage model, and one 3 cluster model. In each pair being compared (2-cluster vs. 2-stage, and 3-cluster vs. 3-stage), the two subjects were equal in mass, diameter, and height. The models were first tested in a theoretical numerical simulation. From the simulation, I found that the 2-cluster model out-performed the 2-stage model, and the 3-cluster model out-performed the 3-stage. Actual flight data, however, was inconclusive due to errors in data collection and design flaws.<br><br>Due to these errors, I am in the process of continuing my experimentation.

MODELING THE DYNAMICS OF A PNEUMATIC WATER SPRAYER
Ross Andrew Coleman
Winner High School, Winner, South Dakota, USA

What determines the velocity of water forced from a pneumatic sprayer, a system that ejects liquid to allow compressed air to expand? I hypothesized that the ideal fluid model would approximate the dynamics of a pneumatic water sprayer at low velocities, with diminishing accuracy resulting from increasing water velocity or decreasing nozzle diameter. <br><br>I conducted my initial experiments using a weed sprayer filled with water. The parabolic path of the sprayed water was used to determine the stream’s velocity at different driving pressures. My results indicate that the ideal fluid model overestimates velocity at the conditions tested. My results also showed that the relative error of the theoretical model increased as nozzle velocity increased. Next, to study a simpler but similar system, I conducted experiments on an open column of liquid with a hole near the bottom. Three different sizes of holes were employed, using water and vegetable oil as the working fluids. At the low velocities tested, the relative error of the theoretical model was independent of velocity. However, the error was affected by the size of the hole. I also found a significant change in the error when an estimate of the efflux coefficient was added to the model.<br><br>I am currently working to improve my theoretical models of fluid flow by incorporating viscosity into my calculations. It is my hope that a more realistic model will predict a fluid’s exit velocity from a tank, even when fluids of differing viscosities are employed.

MAGNETOPLASMADYNAMICS: IONIZATION AND MAGNETIC FIELD
Ray Chengchuan He
Hempfield High School, Landisville PA, USA

This project sought to determine the effect of magnetic fields on the ionization of argon plasma at various pressures. Finite element analyses were used to calculate the magnetic fields. A vacuum chamber and plasma reactor were successfully created to test the effect on ionization.<br><br> For the first time, equations relating breakdown voltage as functions of transverse magnetic field and the pressure-distance product were established. The simplest model was obtained using non-linear regressions:<br><br> Vb(B,pd) = 564-124ln(pd)-9.34ln^2(pd)+9.29ln^3(pd)+743B<br><br>with a correlation constant of .9526, where Vb is breakdown voltage, pd is pressure-distance product, and B is magnetic field. Other equations modeled specific relationships. The average and maximum standard deviations were 2.855 and 8.526 volts, respectively. The data and equations, which support the hypothesis that voltage will increase as a function of magnetic field, are statistically significant according to .001 confidence level t-tests.<br><br> Equations obtained from experimental data can be used to create specific environments in industries utilizing magnetoplasmadynamics, such as space exploration, fusion power, and semiconductor manufacture. A direct application involves controlling breakdown voltages in NASA’s ion engine. Preventing breakdown in the xenon-feed system will increase the efficiency of ionization in the engine.<br><br> From observations of magnet surface defections caused by ion bombardment in this experiment, a new process was devised to create pinning sites in magnets to increase coercivity. This process was tested on several samples, which were sent to research institutions for magnetometer testing and transmission electron microscopy of the surface. Preliminary results support the validity of the process.

ALTERATION OF FABRIC STRENGTH AND TEXTURE BY EXPOSURE TO ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF OZONE
Angy Nabil Mounir
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, Kentucky, United States

Ozone is a strong oxidant, known to reduce the strength of rubber and a few fabrics. There has been limited research on ozone’s effect on common fabrics and that is the focus of this project. The purpose was to determine how physical characteristics of various textiles are affected by exposure to the oxidant. These studies include four widely used fabrics: cotton, polyester, rayon, and spandex.<br><br>The fabrics were exposed to 49 ppm ozone for 40 hours, and cotton and polyester were exposed for an additional 30 hours since they showed no effects after the original interval. A dissecting pin attached to a computer force probe enabled the measurement of the force needed to induce failure in control and experimental textiles. Ten trials took place for each sample. The average values for the control fabrics were 2.17 N for cotton, 8.01 N for polyester, 3.38 N for rayon, and 1.19 N for spandex. After the initial ozone exposure, rayon had deteriorated, so that the average force to puncture was only 2.20 N. Cotton showed no significant change after forty hours (2.29 N). However, it weakened after seventy hours so that only 1.88 N were required to puncture it. Polyester also did not change in strength after forty hours (9.24 N) or after seventy hours (8.09 N). Using NIH Image software, microscopic examinations of both the control and exposed fabrics were conducted. Cotton and polyester displayed no changes in microscopic profile after exposure. Rayon’s light regions after exposure were slightly smaller than before (P = 0.03), and dark regions after exposure were substantially longer than before (P << 0.001). Spandex’s dark areas appeared smaller, and the white areas more frayed. There was no change in appearance before or after exposure in any fabric except spandex, which yellowed. <br><br>

ON THE QUANTUM DUALITY OF BETA RADIATION
An T. Ho
Piedmont Hills High School, San Jose, California, United States of America

All matter, including subatomic particles such as electron, may exhibit wave properties. If I can show that a relative number of electrons undergo a unique property of waves called total internal reflection, rather than refraction or diffraction, I can prove that electrons have unique wavelike natures. To summarize, the problem of my project is when beta rays are sent from a slow water medium to a fast air medium, will the electrons reflect completely at the surface? Given that there is a chance of the electrons acting as waves as it passes through two contrasting mediums, I hypothesize that the beta rays should exhibit total internal reflection.<br><br> In this experiment, I use a galvanized pipe filled with water to direct a stream of beta particles from a strontium-90 source at 90 degrees, 75 degrees, 35 degrees, and 15 degrees, and then measure the average counts of ionization from the beta particles per minute using a Geiger counter. The average counts per minute decreased from 23, to 23, to 21 to 15 counts per minute respectively. My results indicate that as the directed angle increases, the counts per minute decreases. However, since the beta particles did not undergo complete internal reflection, I have not confirmed my hypothesis.<br><br> Further projects include testing with different sources at different angles and testing the linear energy transmission of beta particles in water.<br><br>

The processes that were observed during the experiment were described in the second chapter , as well as well-known and unknown effects (known were: water electrolysis, phenomenon of sublimation, turbulence in liquids, and almost uninvestigated phenomenon of screen boiling); unknown effects were: vibration of wires made from different materials accompanied with low-frequency noise, «running of bubbles», and interesting influence of magnetic and electric fields on wires movement and noise! For achievement of our goals we used some simple school and some difficult physical devices(including videorecording). <br><br> The model of happening processes was made. Given model was checked and the result happened to be the same as the one we got by theoretic way and it confirmed the accuracy of our model (hypothesis).The accuracy of the results was checked by the method of physical analysis.

IV. MEASUREMENTS OF INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT ELECTRON DENSITY USING MICROWAVE INTERFEROMETRY
Tianhui Li
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, Oregon, USA

Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) uses simple electric fields to confine FUSION-producing PLASMA. Inside a VACUUM, an electrostic potential is generated between a transparent geodesic cathode and a larger spherical anode shell. I modeled the reactor based on Hirsch's derivation of Poisson's Equation and wrote a C++ program to solve the model. The model confirmed the alternating shells of positive and negative charge that constitute the plasma. The second component of the project involved measuring the electron density of the plasma with a MICROWAVE INTERFEROMETER. Microwaves 'shift' while passing through plasma depending on the electron density. By measuring a microwave beam passing through plasma versus a reference beam, I measured the electron density to be 5.5 E10 cm^-3, higher than was previously recorded in the literature. The higher density is more favorable to attaining breakeven fusion and is attributed to the use of "Paschen Breakdown" for background gas ionization. Aside from being a potential energy source, IEC has a variety of other applications including NEUTRON TOMOGRAPHY and synthesizing radioisotopes used in MEDICAL DIAGNOSES. Its light weight compared to other conventional reactors allows IEC to be used as a reactor aboard SPACE and NAVY ships.

ANALYSIS OF STRING INSTRUMENTS AND SOUND
Ileana Talia Sevilla
Charlestown High School, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the different factors that affect the sound created by string instruments. <br><br> From the research it was found that the resonance chamber in any string instrument amplifies the vibrations created by the strings and the composition of the harmonics depends chiefly on it. The composition of the strings, and other components of the instrument, is important in determining the quality of the sound. <br><br> By experimenting with notes and their measured frequencies from a violin using a digital oscilloscope and fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analyzer, the musical patterns were studied. Graphs of notes in A major scale produced by an electronic wave generator (WG) and a violin were compared. The WG produced pure tones, therefore, the FFT showed only the fundamental frequency. However, the FFT of the violin showed peaks of higher frequencies than the fundamental, or harmonics.<br><br> The harmonics differed in each different note played on one violin, and also differed when the same note played two times on a violin. The quality of the sound of a violin or other string instrument depends on the different compositions of harmonics. <br><br> A possible extension of this work includes the study of other factors that affect the sound such as air pressure, temperature, and an increased sample size. <br><br>

FROM FLYING INSECTS TO MICRO AIR VEHICLES- HOW ANGLE OF ATTACK AFFECTS LIFT FOR A MODEL INSECT WING
Samuel Joseph Hefty
Luke M. Powers Catholic High School, Mt. Morris Twp., Michigan, USA

Scientists have looked at designing tiny flying machines called micro air vehicles (MAVs) by looking at the aerodynamic mechanisms that govern insect flight. Equipped with video and audio sensors, these micro machines could provide vital surveillance information under difficult and hazardous conditions.<br><br> Unlike the fixed wings of airplanes and birds, insects have moving wings that can sustain lift by making efficient use of formed vortices. In order to understand the relationships between insect flight and a model insect wing for its application to the design of a robotic micro flyer, two sets of experiments were conducted.<br><br> Wing shapes of four different flies from the Class Diptera were used to create airfoils, scaled to a six-inch wingspan. These airfoils were tested in a wind tunnel to find the critical angle of attack, which produced the most lift, and is the point where wing rotation occurs in insects. A figure-eight flight pattern was theorized and tested, showing the changing amounts of lift produced by a wing at different angles.<br><br> The experiments showed that shape, movement, and angles of attack of a model insect wing influence the maximum lift generated. The angles of wing rotation and the theorized figure-eight pattern calculated by these experiments can be used in constructing a micro air vehicle.<br><br>

3...2...1...LIFTOFF MODELING ROCKETRY
Chris Hale Barnes, Woodrow Wilson Senior High School
Washington D.C., U.S.A.

This project compares two modeling approaches for predicting model rocket altitude, which includes a mathematical model based on physics and a statistical model. The models investigate how weight, engine thrust, and drag influence the altitude to which model rockets fly. The hypothesis of the project was that the mathematical model would better predict the effects weight, drag and thrust upon the rocket’s altitude.<br><br> To evaluate both models the research procedure was designed to examine the actual effects of weight, drag and thrust on the altitude of rockets with actual flight data. To enable a proper statistical analysis for this project, rockets were launched 8 additional times for a total of 31 launches. The independent variable of rocket altitude was measured using a Skyscope for all 31 launches. The dependent variables were the thrust of the rocket engine, the frontal area of the rockets, and the weight of the rockets with various payloads consisting of nails.<br><br> The results indicate that the predicted height based on the mathematical computer model was slightly more accurate than the statistical model in predicting the measured height of the rocket launches. As predicted by the models, weight, drag, and engine thrust have a significant impact upon the apogee of the rocket. <br><br> The main contribution of this project is to provide an easy method to predict the altitude of model rockets. The results can be used by model rocket enthusiasts to easily calculate the altitude of their rockets with implications for choosing safe launching sites.

LISTENING FOR ENERGY
Fred Leon Stone
West Plains High School, West Plains, MO, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to find a relationship between the amount of kinetic energy and sound energy involved in a collision. My hypothesis was that a relationship exists between these two energies and given one, the other can be predicted. <br><br> To find a relationship between these two energies, I measured the kinetic energy and found the amount of sound energy given off by the collision. To measure the intensity of the sound, in dB, I used a sophisticated decibel meter that would flash the intensity of the sound on the screen. This was placed two meters above the collision site. I recorded the height and mass of each steel sphere dropped. To attempt to measure the amount of time the sound took to occur, I constructed a platform into which a speaker was enclosed. This speaker was connected to an oscilloscope which was placed near a stopwatch. Both were recorded during the collision and two times were recorded: one at the beginning of the peak, one at the end. The difference of these values gave me the amount of time. I later played this back in slow motion. After calculating kinetic energy and sound energy, I created a scatter plot to view the relationship. <br><br>My conclusion is that there is a relationship between kinetic energy and sound energy involved in a collision. This relationship is most likely quadratic, but could be exponential.<br><br>

THE PHYSICS OF MALLET PERCUSSION; THE SEARCH FOR AN ALTERNATE WOOD - YEAR 2
Ashley Renee Woodall
North Garland High School, Garland, Texas, USA

My project was focused around the problem that the wood commonly used for making marimbas, Honduran Rosewood, is becoming rare due to the recent destruction of the South American rainforests. The problem is compounded by the fact that Rosewood is a slow growing tree. This is my second year to find an alternative for Rosewood, but this year I will use imported and domestic hardwoods.<br><br> In my project, I built a test marimba and used several woods with Honduran Rosewood to fabricate marimba bars tuned to a pentatonic scale. The bars were tuned to D4, E4, G4, A4, & B4. I also made 5 resonators tuned to each corresponding bar.<br><br> In my experiment, I conducted two tests to determine similarity to Rosewood. I tested for decay time and conducted a spectral analysis. I used the waveform to sample the volume of decay at 0.05-second intervals. Then the spectrum was viewed, and the top 5 peaks were recorded into a spreadsheet (frequency and amplitude were recorded). This allowed me to compare each bar's overtone strength to Rosewood.<br><br>For the overall likeness to Rosewood, Padauk was the closest wood tested again this year. In both decay time and overtone similarity, it possessed the least amount of differences to Rosewood than any other bar. This is a very good result since Padauk is $8/board foot compared to Rosewood at $20+/board foot. Not only is it more cost effective, but also Padauk is much more common than Rosewood.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION INTO AUTOMOBILE AERODYNAMICS
Molly von der Heydt, Falmouth Academy
Falmouth, MA, United States

When purchasing automobiles, many peoples’ decisions are more about form than function, despite the fact that car manufacturers put a lot into designing an aerodynamically efficient car. The purpose of this experiment was to develop a basic understanding of automobile aerodynamics and to compare the drag coefficients (Cd) of 5 wood models, a block, a Lamborghini Murciélago-based model, an BMW M3-based model, a Ford Windstar-based model, and an original design to each other and the full-scale cars they represented. It was hypothesized that these comparisons could be made, a Prototype design could be created, and that the model based on the Lamborghini Murciélago would be the lowest drag shape. <br><br>Drag and wind speed were measured in a wind tunnel with a force meter and manometer. There are two types of drag that apply to this experiment, friction drag, which is associated with the boundary layer, the viscosity of the fluid, and the surface of the object, and form drag, which is due to a pressure imbalance between two points on an object. <br><br>In all tests, the Block model had the highest Cd, followed by the Windstar model, the M3 model, the Lamborghini model, and the Prototype design. Though the Cds of the models were remarkably consistent, their Cds did not compare well with the actual vehicle Cds due to their simplicity. <br><br>As it was shown with these models that streamlining greatly lowers the drag of automobiles, relatively inexpensive small-scale wind tunnel testing may prove to be very useful in car design.<br><br>

IS THE WIND PREDICTABLE?
Nolan Herman Reis
Palo Alto High School, Palo Alto, California

The intent of this project is to find out if the wind is predictable within a day. If true, then for a sailboat race, the racer could use trend data to predict upcoming wind direction shifts to sail a shorter course. <br><br> My first step was to collect highly accurate wind data and then analyze it for trends. Unfortunately, conventional wind instruments didn’t work because they weren’t sensitive to small wind direction shifts. So, I designed an apparatus, which uses a cross-axis of ultrasonic transmitters and receivers. Sonic pulses are then sent along each axis. The magnitude of the wind’s effect on each pulse’s transit time is logged to determine the wind speed and direction. For example, if the wind is behind an ultrasonic transmitter, the pulse will get to its receiver faster than if there was no wind. <br><br> Tests were done to verify that there is a linear relationship between the sonic pulse transit time and the wind. The data were then collected at Redwood City, CA and compared to a USGS weather station there. Every 20 seconds the wind direction and speed were stored. <br><br> The data shows that the wind direction is (within a day) often predictable. It is sinusoidal in structure, with a typical period of 15-50 minutes. When it occurs, its pattern continues throughout the afternoon. Using this data, one could look at trends and determine how to sail a much shorter course to win races.<br><br>

CHAOTIC FLUIDS - AN EXAMINATION OF PHASE TRANSITIONS IN TAYLOR-COUETTE FLOW
Mairead Mary McCloskey, Loreto College Castlerock Road Coleraine
Co Derry N. Ireland BT51 3JZ

An experimental apparatus to study the behaviour of the Taylor-Couette system was designed, built and tested. By means of computer controlled stepper-motors, the apparatus allows precisely controlled driving of independently rotating, co-axial cylinders, between which the fluid under study was confined. Drive speeds were controlled to an accuracy of better than 0.5%. The flow of the fluid was visualised using Kalliroscope, a suspension of mica crystals which exposes fluid flow directions by differential light scattering. Flow regimes were initially identified qualitatively and then characterised by measuring the time variation of the intensity of light scattered from the fluid, using a digital video camera. Phase transitions between the flow regimes were mapped on a phase plane whose co-ordinates are Reynold’s numbers of the inner and outer cylinders (Ro-Ri space). The predicted rapid onset of chaotic behaviour over very small increments in Reynolds numbers was observed. Twelve distinct flow regimes were identified and the corresponding phase transitions were mapped on the Ro-Ri phase plane. Significant departures from published research were observed. In particular a number of phase transitions appear to be gradational over significant ranges in Ro and Ri. Detailed investigations of selected transitions showed locally strong hysteresis which was shown to vary systematically with Reynold’s number in the counter rotating condition. Hysteresis was not observed for co-rotating cylinders. Modulation of the driving Reynolds numbers, by the periodic forcing of either cylinder, was found to have no measurable effect on the location of phase transitions in Ro-Ri space.

THE EFFECT OF INNER ELECTRON DENSITY ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT
Roy Connor Sheppard
Stanton College Prep, Jacksonville Fl, Duval

This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that increases in inner electron density in substances would increase the refraction of light by those substances. Light refraction is caused by interaction with electrons in the substance through which it passes, and since inner electrons are held more strongly to the nucleus than the outer electrons, it was believed that these inner electrons are the ones that interfere with light and cause the refraction.<br><br> Inner electron densities (IED) of various substances were calculated and 0.50M solutions were prepared. Each solution was placed in a semicircular-shaped refracting dish and using pins to establish light rays for incident angles of 60, 65, and 70 degrees, the refracted rays were marked and their angles measured.<br><br> Convention holds that mass density scales with refraction. But the results do not support this convention. No correlation between either outer electron density or total electron density and refraction was observed. The results however do show a close correlation between inner electron density and refraction. Refraction increased with increase of inner electron density for all compounds for all incident angles. Refraction of the ammonium compounds indicate that additional factors such as type of bonding may also affect refraction because while these compounds did scale with inner electron density with respect to each other they did not scale with the inner electron densities of the other compounds. Therefore the hypothesis was supported, but not proved.<br><br>

BEAMED ENERGY PROPULSION BY MEANS OF TARGET ABLATION
Benjamin Arthur Rosenberg
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, United States

Beamed Energy Propulsion is a relatively new field of study, and consists of firing a high-powered laser at a metallic target. The laser ablates the metal into plasma, which streams away in a propulsion plume. Metal targets may be coated with liquids which enhance the thrust of the reaction.<br><br> This project tests which combinations of solid targets and liquids are most effective at converting such energy.<br><br> Preliminary testing was completed using a local laser with ablative photographic paper as a target. Pendulum deflections were digitally recorded to calculate results. 64 targets were tested dry, with water, canola oil, and methanol as additives.<br><br> Full laboratory experimentation was completed using a high-powered laser. Targets made of aluminum, titanium, and copper were tested in carefully monitored laboratory conditions on ballistic pendulums. The same liquids were tested, and four tests were made for each combination.<br><br> Each test was recorded on high speed digital video, and reviewed on a computer. The angle of deflection was recorded, and calculations demonstrated the efficiency of conversion from beamed energy into kinetic energy for each test.<br><br> Aluminum targets proved to be most efficient, followed by titanium, and copper. The most efficient additive was water, followed by canola oil, methanol, and dry.<br><br> To further demonstrate these principles, paper airplanes with aluminum targets were launched using laser beams. The testing was so successful that a new world’s record was recorded for distance traveled by an airplane propelled by BEP. The project proved that BEP is a viable source of propulsion.<br><br>

TESLA COIL RESONANCE
Alex Barry Costa
Hilton Head High, Hilton Head SC, USA

The goal of this experiment was to achieve resonance in an air core resonating transformer (tesla coil). Several variables were tested: the tap point of the primary coil, the overall length of the spark gap, and the size of the discharge electrode. Tap points of 10, 11, and 12 turns were tested. There were 12 sections of copper pipe each separated by 0.025 inches. Gaps of 0.15,0 .2, 0.25, and 0.3 inches were all used. For the discharge electrode 6 different sizes were tested. All discharge electrodes were coated in aluminum foil tape. The sizes were (diameter of sphere in inches) 1.68, 2.5, 4, 5, and 6. A 3x14 inch toroid was also used. First the length of spark gap was tested with the smallest discharge electrode in place. The results were: 0.15-inch gap-4 inch discharge, 0.2 inch- 5 inch discharge, 0.25 inch- 6 inch discharge, and .3 inch- 7 inch discharge. It was determined that the tap point had little effect on the coil for the values tested. Relying only on visual observations there was no change in output. For testing the discharge electrode the largest spark gap was used (0.3 inches). The 1.68 inch sphere produced a 7 inch spark, the 2.5 inch sphere produced a 6 inch spark, the 4 inch sphere produced a 6 inch spark, the five inch sphere produced a 10 inch spark, the 6 inch sphere produced a 4 inch spark, and the toroid produced no spark. In conclusion the 0.3 inch spark gap with a tap point of 12 turns and the 5 inch spherical dishchage electrode optimized the effects of the tesla coil.

STUCK IN A RUT? TRY 10% CRUMB RUBBER
Kelsee R. Stephens
Gaffney High School, Gaffney, SC, USA

The goal of this experiment is to show that crumbe rubber from recycled tires can be used to improve the life and safety of asphalt paved highways. There are many problems with tires today that are hazardous to our environment. Landfills become so filled up with tire waste that many other landfills are created and before we know it, there are huge tire piles in our backyards. Also, pools of water are retained in the tires from rain and this creates a very nice living environment for mosquitoes to nest. Tires that have already been used cannot be recycled to make new tires. The quality of the new tires would be horrible, and most important, unsafe to use on the roadways. Asphalt pavement can be extremely expensive, especially when it comes to laying two to four lane highways. It is known that if polymers (plastics) are mixed with asphalt it will cause the pavement to last longer. Recycled crumb rubber can improve asphalt like other polymers. In this experiment, I varied amounts of crumb rubber blended with standard asphalt binder. The caused the viscosity of the asphalt binder to change. I showed that this increase in viscosity led to the improvement to resistance to rutting when blended with an asphalt mix. Increased amounts of crumb rubber will cause higher viscosity in asphalt binders. That in turn will improve resistance to rutting. Analysis of data shows addition of crumb rubber in moderate amounts improves the life and safety of highway asphalt.

TO INFINITY AND BEYOND? THE EFFECTS OF WATER TO AIR PRESSURE RATIO ON WATER ROCKETS
Caleb Lee Meeks, Cumberland Valley Christian Home School
Corbin, KY, USA

A water rocket is propelled when compressed water and air, as stored energy, are released from a nozzle as kinetic energy in a downward direction, thus propelling the rocket in an upward direction. By launching rockets with varying water and air pressures, varying altitudes are achieved. The effects of water to air pressure (psi) ratios on altitude were investigated. <br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to learn the volume of water necessary for a water rocket to reach its highest altitude for any psi. Using a theodolite tracking system, a control rocket, and a specific air pressure (80 psi) the ideal ratio of water to air pressure necessary to reach maximum altitude was determined. This ratio (0.5 ltr:80 psi) was then applied to varying pressures in order to determine if it enabled the rocket to reach maximum altitudes at each of those pressures. The expectation was that if the ratio held true, one could know, for any psi, the ideal volume of water for that psi and predict the maximum altitude the rocket would attain.<br><br>The results supported the expectation at 100 psi, but failed at 60 psi thus, disproving the projection that the ratio would apply to all air pressures. <br><br>This discovery lead to the assumption that the ideal ratio would change again at a pressure beyond the control rocket's maximum pressure range (145 Psi.). However, for pressures within the control rocket's range, the equation: Y=mX-b -- where Y = average of the altitudes achieved using the found ratio, X = average of the air pressures tested, and intercept (b) = (0,0)-- was used to graph slope (m), and project the approximate altitudes of future launches. <br><br>

AERODYNAMIC DRAG EFFECTS ON OSCILLATORY MOTION OF A SPHERE
Stephen T. Clark
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach, FL, USA

One purpose of this science project is to measure the effect of drag on the amplitude of a spring/spherical-mass system. Spheres of differing size but constant mass are suspended from a spring and allowed to oscillate. both the amplitude and frequency are measured for each of four spheres. The tests also included a control mass with nearly zero aerodynamic drag.<br><br> A second purpose is to compare the predictions of a force-based differential equation to data collected from experimentation. To be solvable, the differential equation is linearized, which means that the drag-force term is simplified.<br><br> A third purpose is to compare the predictions of a time-stepping math model to data collected from experimentation. Unlike the differential-equation approach, this model does not require linearization.<br><br> The fourth purpose of this project is to combine the mathematical models and the data to determine an appropriate drag coefficient for oscillatory motion of a sphere.<br><br> Materials inlcude a rigid support structure, a Hooke's Law spring, different sizes of spherical Styrofoam balls, a stopwatch, a tape measure, and a means of attaching the balls to the spring.<br><br> I expect the larger the frontal area of the spherical mass, the faster the amplitude will decay. I also expect the time-stepping model to fit the data better than the differential equation because the time-step model is not linearized. The drag-coefficient should be similar to that for steady-state motion.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AIR-CORED RESONANT TRANSFORMER AND THE QUANTIFICATION OF ARC-INDUCED OZONE
Abram Levi Coley
Big Sky High School, Missoula, Montana, USA

An air-cored resonant transformer is designed, constructed and optimized. The gas phase ozone produced by the air-cored resonant transformer is then quantified. The primary circuit of the air-cored resonant transformer operates at a frequency of 9.7 x 10^5 Hz. The primary circuit inductor was found to have an inductance of 4.1 x 10^-6 H.<br><br> The ozone produced by the air-cored resonant transformer is collected in an oxidation resistant environment and reacted with a two-part iodide solution, mixed in equal volumes: Solution A consists of KI, NaOH, a molybdate catalyst, and Solution B is potassium hydrogen phthalate. The tri-iodide ion forms during the reaction. The solution is analyzed spectrophotometrically for the presence of the tri-iodide ion, which is indicated by a yellow color. <br><br> To calculate ozone production, the molar absorptivity of the tri-iodide ion was established to be 2.75 x 10^4 LM^-1cm^-1. The two-part iodide solution is then reacted with produced ozone for six minutes and absorbance data is gathered in 30-second intervals. Absorbance data is plotted versus time. Beer’s law and stoichiometric techniques are then used to establish a rate of ozone production. The rate of ozone production by the air-cored resonant transformer was calculated to 6.4 x 10^-7 moles O3 per minute. <br><br>

A STUDY OF DNA ADSORPTION KINETICS ON OTS SURFACES
Joseph Michael Barone
West Islip High School, West Islip NY, USA

The evaporation kinetics of TE buffer droplets containing DNA were studied as a function of DNA molecular weight and DNA concentration. The contact angle and overall droplet morphology were observed using a KSV contact angle goniometer as a function of time. Simultaneously, the DNA distribution and adsorption kinetics were measured with confocal microscopy. The DNA droplets were deposited on hydrophobic OTS-covered silicon surfaces and stained with an ethidium bromide solution. The results show that a DNA ring is formed at the air/solid/liquid interface around the circumference of the drying droplet in a manner similar to that reported for colloidal suspensions. DNA adsorption values were determined by measuring the florescent intensity of the resulting ring. The droplet drying dynamics and DNA morphology are affected by both the molecular weight and the DNA concentration.

The purpose of this experiment was to find out which wheels, out of three that were picked, were fastest in speed and time according to their aerodynamic ability. The problem was what is the affect on the performance of bicycles if different wheels are added to enhance aerodynamics. At the beginning of the experiment, it was predicted that if the aerodynamic drag were reduced, by changing the wheels, then the rider would attain a higher speed and therefore a decrease in time. <br><br>The basic outline of the experiment is this: Perform the roll out method with the Alex rim wheel set for a total of six trials. Next, change the wheels to the Rolf Vector Pro wheel set and complete procedure the same as the Alex Rim wheels. Lastly, change the wheels to the ZIPP disc rear and ZIPP three-spoke front wheel set and complete the roll out method for a total of six trials. <br><br>The Alex Rim "training" wheels average time was 33.68 seconds, the average speed was 39.89 kmph, and the average maximum speed was 63.89 kmph. The Rolf Vector Pro wheels average time was 32.53 seconds, the average speed was 42.15 kmph, and the average maximum speed was 66.31 kmph. The ZIPP carbon disc rear wheel and front three-spoke wheel average time was 32.46 seconds, the average speed was 42.72 kmph, and the average maximum speed was 65.99. Overall the ZIPP carbon disc rear wheel and front three-spoke wheel would prove to be the fastest combination over a long course because a higher average speed would result in a lower time, over a given distance. <br><br>In conclusion, this experiment provided the results that were needed. Cyclists and tri-atheletes can use this information when purchasing wheels. This experiment was a great learning experience plus it was fun!<br><br>

Astronaut High School, Titusville, FL, USA

The project involves the investigation into the behavior of several different ionized solutions to determine their magnetohydrodynamic response as it applies to MHD power generation.<br><br> First, the researchers collected information and performed research on low-temperature plasma and its characteristics. Plywood, tubing, PVC pipe, and other materials were assembled into a test apparatus. Test solutions were prepared using sodium potassium tartrate (Rochelle Salt) and sodium chloride with distilled water as the basis for the solutions. They calculated how many grams of chemical would be needed to obtain three liters at certain solution concentrations. The researchers gathered brackish water from Sandpoint Park and seawater from the Atlantic Ocean. They conducted over 390 individual test flows, amounting to over 40,000 data points on 9 different solutions. Distilled water was used as the control.<br><br> The salt solutions test results indicated that the velocity and the magnetic field strength had a direct influence on the voltage produced. Rochelle Salt solutions yielded totally unexpected responses to the test combinations. The results contradicted the models for electrolytes as described in other documents. Although the sodium chloride solutions provide linear response to the magnetic field and the velocity, the application of the idea to generate power from such a device commercially may not be entirely feasible.<br><br> Additional testing will be accomplished to see if Rochelle salts (in a crystalline form) could be used in a different type of apparatus utilizing its inherent high piezoelectric properties in the presence of a MHD environment.<br><br><br>

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation on the effects of sound quality based on different types of wood and different notes. The Initial experiment was based solely on the alterations of wood, but finally changed to an altering of wood and notes. In the changing out of wood, 3/4 inch and 1/2 inch was used for each of the following types of wood; MDF,particle board, and plywood. Two boxes of each were made with a place for the speaker. Then each box was tested with each note; A,E, and D. With the speaker properly secured on the box, a single note was played, from the same CD player, and finally to the computer, where graphs are made, and data collected and printed off. The contributions of this project are in a way both helpful to the manufacturer, and the owner. It will in turn allow users to view which type of material that sounds the best at the appropriate thickness, and at what type of tone. It also proves that the more reliable material to use is MDF, at 3/4 of an inch. The benefit of the speaker box qualities was demonstrated.

The researchers started this experiment by putting a softball on a catapult and launching the softball in the air. Then the researchers measured how far the softball traveled from the catapult to the landing spot of the softball. Also measured was the degrees of the air temperature they were testing in and the wind conditions. There was no wind at any temperature. Then angle and force at which the catapult was at remained the exact same throughout this experiment. Also, the same softball was used to avoid false results. The researchers created their own device to throw the softball into the air, but if testing this experiment on your own, buying a catapult is also an option.<br><br>After the experiment was tested the results came out how the researchers predicted. The softball traveled farther in the warm weather than in the cold weather. In 16 oC the average distanced traveled was 9.703 meters. In the 10 oC the average distance traveled was 8.975 meters. In the 4 oC the average distance traveled was 8.101 meters and in the -7 oC the average distance was 7.876 meters. The researchers found their hypothesis was correct according to the results obtained. In conclusion, the researchers have found the warmer the weather is, the farther distance the softball will travel.<br><br>

The purpose of our project was to construct an accelerator with amateur budget big enough to be able to trigger nuclear reactions. For this we had to satisfy the conditions of practical as well as theoretical part of the project.<br><br>The construction itself presented quite a technical challenge because of its requirements for high precision work. The theoretical part includes accurate theoretical models, predictions and knowledge of classical and modern physics.<br><br>The accelerator is based on Van de Graaff electrostatic generator which produces half a million volts. Protons are created in an ion source inside the sphere of the generator with nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen gas. The protons accelerate from positive potential through the evacuated accelerating tube to the grounded target where they fuse with light nuclei.<br><br>We used Beryllium as a target and measured the produced radioactivity with the Geiger-Muller tube. The number of events per minute we detected (40) was noticeably larger than the natural radioactive background (25), but much less than dangerous. Our theoretical model predicted 210 events per minute, but we detected only 15 effective gamma photons. The reason for this was that the detector covered only a small space angle. This is the proof that we succeeded in triggering nuclear reactions in which Boron nuclei and gamma rays were created.<br><br> Ideal experiments are with targets of light nuclei where all types of rays are produced. We have developed a small and economic device according to energies it produces and possibilities of usage in various research on Institutes, as a modern inexpensive school tool at Universities as well as application in medicine (proton observations) or industry (X-ray spectrometry).<br><br>

TONER PARTICLES ON AN OHP TRANSPARENCY SHEET AS A GRATING FOR DIFFRACTION.
Mai Ikeda, Natumi Kamioka
Niihama-west High School ,Niihama, Ehime,Japan

Shooting a laser beam through a monochromatically printed OHP transparency sheet, we observed a straight line on a screen. Assuming that the phenomenon was a kind of diffraction, we decided to look for that which acts as a grating. By looking at the printed part, we found that toner particles were regularly placed. The lattice constant was obtained by a formula, sin = . We also measured the interval of the lines of toner particles with a micrometer.<br><br> The former method gave the grating constant 1.19x10 m, whereas the latter method gave as1.20x10 m, in satisfactory agreement.<br><br>By contrast, the multicolour-printed OHP transparency was found to produce various diffraction patterns. These diffraction patterns were due to the regular arrangement of the toner particles. The yellow toner particles line up and the line of yellow color intersects those of other colors with 10 , 110 , or 130 ,whereas the lines of the other colors intersect each other at 120 . We believe the electric charges on a drum of the printer determine the arrangement of the particles.<br><br>

ANTIGRAVITY?
Ethan Arthur Rein, Jim Bergren, Luke Duncan
Dearborn High School, Dearborn, Michigan, 48124, USA

“Antigravity?” contains two parts. In the first part, a “lifter” is constructed. This is a triangular craft made of balsa wood, steel wire, and aluminum foil. When electricity is fed to the craft, it floats above the ground, restricted only to the tethers attached, preventing the apparatus from flying out of control. The process of proving that the apparatus works is the first segment of the project.<br><br> <br><br>Next, the reason the apparatus flies is examined. One theory to be tested is the effect of electricity passing between two lines of metal, pushing the air between them down, forcing the apparatus up in the air, due to Newton's Third Law. This is the “ion wind theory.” This theory is tested with a line of fog running under the apparatus as a way to see the effect of an air current. <br><br>The second theory states that the electricity causes the apparatus to create a positive charge above the craft and a negative charge below. This apparatus moves toward the positive charge, and under the correct circumstances, upward. This is called the “Biefield-Brown Effect.” "Antigravity?" attempts to test the validity of this theory through experimentation. A test of the craft in mineral oil is done to eliminate the effect of air in the working of the apparatus.<br><br>

BIONICS - A TECHNICAL REALIZATION OF CRAWLING
Daniel Illhardt, Tanja Zimmermann
Gymnasium "Am Lindenberg", Ilmenau, Thuringia, GERMANY

The aim of our work starting on 3rd of March 2002 was to turn over the movement of a snail technically, with the intention of creating a prototype whose fields of use could be as variable as the living space of snails. First the locomotion of this animal was analyzed with the help of literature, to see the special, detailed process of movement. One part is the foot wave caused by the special coordination of muscles in the foot which presents the mechanical part of the movement. On the other hand the slime produced by the snail which makes the movement possible through its changeable qualities. In our work we concentrated on the creation of a movement system, in which the energy is realized by a wire making the mast of the "Shape-Memory-Effect". A prototype was created in which the mechanical part of the snail's movement was put to technique. However, the realization of a non-symmetrical friction was only possible because of the compromise with the bristles. Therefore a movement of the available model finished on 16th of February 2003 is only possible on a horizontal pad at the present time.

WHAT LIGHT MAKES IT RIGHT? THE EFFECTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ON PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM
Abigail Shaha, Hilarie Ann Laukat, Emily Ann Smith
Crescent View Middle School, Sandy, Utah, USA

A simple step outdoors can lead one to believe that there is more to light than meets the eye. The human eye recognizes only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as visible light; while human skin responds to the ultra-violet (UV) portion by tanning or sun burning. With the help of specialized equipment, the entire spectrum can be perceived. This project is an investigation of how different types of radiation accessible to inexperienced researchers affect standard color film. <br><br> In order to conduct this investigation, several different photographic subjects were used to measure distinguishable features: true color, depth, surface texture, and recognition. By photographing each subject under x-ray, infrared, UV-A, UV-B, radio, and visible light, precise data were gathered to form a conclusion. For the photographs taken, precautions were made to ensure that the range of the electromagnetic spectrum being tested was the only radiation present when the pictures were taken. The same film, camera settings, and developing center were used for every photograph developed, to control variables. <br><br> Film exposed to visible light produced images as they would appear to the naked eye. Exposure to UV-B showed many distinguishable features, while UV-A showed very few. Infrared, like radio waves, produced unrecognizable photographs, while x-ray radiation showed no effect on standard film. <br><br> It was discovered that the tested ranges of wavelengths outside that of visible light, affected film differently than expected. Of all ranges, visible light showed the most distinguishable features on standard film, as was hypothesized.<br><br>

DETERMINING CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF URANIUM OXIDE (UOX) AS A THIN FILM IN SOFT X-RAY REFLECTANCE
Hollilyne Drury, Megan Rowberry
Provo High School, Provo, Utah, United States

It has been found that the use of uranium oxides have promising results in astronomical optics as low-angle reflectors as well as other soft x-ray applications. Prior research has shown that a possibility of several forms of uranium oxide could exist as thin films, with uranium as the likely candidate. Our first experiment was to determine if the uranium oxides that were being used were uranium dioxide. By heating the UOx sample under vacuum conditions, crystal structures within the films were produced, allowing for analysis and verification of the crystal structure. Our second experiment was to determine if the uranium oxide would change if the atmosphere within the sputtered system was changed. After obtaining the newly sputtered samples, more calculations were done to determine the substance. These experiments and the information produced are key elements for the researchers at a local university, possible changing the target reflectance goals for the uranium oxide mirror that they are making.

DISCRIMINATION OF VIOLIN QUALITIES THROUGH FREQUENCY TIME ANALYSIS
Linden Webster
Beeslack Community High School, Midlothian, Scotland, UK

The project involved the recording of violins of different qualities and sizes. The project aimed to determine whether the positioning of the air and wood resonances affected the quality of the instrument and to determine characteristics present in a good quality violin. The main air and wood resonances were measured and analysed taking into account varying instrument size and quality. The harmonic break-up of the sounds was analysed using a program called MATLAB to detemine whether the harmonic pattern was related to quality. Different methods of playing the violin were examined, from playing with the bow to plucking the string. This included the technique of playing " vibrato", which is deliberately causing oscillation of the note frequency, thereby improving the tone.<br><br>It was discovered that the placing of the main air and wood resonances had a considerable effect on tone quality. It is known that the best quality instuments have a main air resonance at around 293Hz and a main wood resonance around 440Hz, and it was found that as the size decreased,the resonances moved further from these ideals. The smaller instruments had a more irregular harmonic pattern, with pronounceed high harmonics, but lacked any deeper harmonics. The misplacing of the resonances on the small instruments caused this decreased sound quality. There were interesting damping effects observed when a plucked "closed string" was compared to the open string. Although the harmonics were dampened and the decay increased when the string was plucked "closed", vibrato reduced the decay.

THE ACOUSTICAL PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT FACTORS IN SUBMERSIBLE DESIGN
Christopher Ray Yen
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Fl, United States

Modern Anti-Submarine Warfare is moving away from listening for submarines and using sound transmissions to locate them using a method called Active Sonar. The recent adoption of High Energy, Low Frequency Sonar mark a clear shift from Passive to Active Sonar. This researcher applied the methods used in stealthing aircraft to submersibles in order to effectively hide them from active Sonar.<br><br>The research involved two facets: Firstly, the development of a shape capable of significantly reducing its sonar Cross-Section, and Secondly, to determine material properties that best absorb Sonar waves. Previous Research had been conducted at 200 kHz, but in order to better simulate military sonar, this researcher conducted a series of 50 kHz tests this year. The data was then transferred to the computer and analyzed using a imaging program. <br><br>This researcher found that the Octahedron had a drastically smaller surface area than a submersible shaped object of the same surface area. A tetrahedron with curved sides had a drastically larger cross-section, creating a larger signal than the ocean floor. The materials test showed that common ceramic tile was capable of absorbing nearly the entire sonar transmission. Thus showing that this researcher's conclusions were still valid at this lower frequency.<br><br>This researcher concluded that an Octahedral or similar shape using a non-crystalline, carbon-composite material will be able to be nearly invisible to Active Sonar. This design can be implemented as a mine, a torpedo, or even a large ballistic missile submarine. The teardrop shape could be implemented as a countermeasure that could easily defeat the active warheads of modern torpedoes by presenting a much larger target than the submarine.<br><br>

SUPER COOL SUPER STRONG
Catherine Nicole Bewerse
Satellite High, Satellite Beach, FL, Brevard

Cryogenics is the science of low temperatures. Cryogenics is used on metals but many commercial companies to strengthen tools, athletic and safety equipment. There is much controversy over what is happening to the metals, since testing results are inconsistent, and many scientists do not believe that a change is happening at all. The ASM has appointed a committee to address the controversy.<br><br> This project's purpose was to discover how cryogenics affects metals. Samples of Aluminum, Copper, Brass, Iron, and Zinc were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), at up to 30,000x magnification. The metals were examined before and after being cryogenically treated with liquid nitrogen for 24 hours. The images were then compared for changes in the surface topography and grain size. The samples were also Nanoindented to gauge their hardness pre- and post-treatment. The indents were then examined under the SEM to identify changes in the pile-up or sink-in phenomenon.<br><br> After treatment, the surfaces of the metals became rougher and pitted. The indents showed more of a sink-in or less of a pile-up. The hardness of the metals was increased, except in Aluminum and Copper. When the metals were cryogenically frozen, they condensed and compressed upon themselves, exceeding the internal yield strength. This induced work hardening. The created stresses deformed the metals and formed dislocations, increasing the strength of the metal and decreasing ductility. Copper and Aluminum both have a face centered cubic lattice structure, which does not allow as much room for compression and prevented strengthening from occurring.<br><br>

REFLECTION PROTECTION WHICH WINDOW TINT LOWERS THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE?
Kayleigh Danielle Lewis
Port Saint Joe High School, Port Saint Joe, Florida, U.S.

I wanted to find out which type of window tint works the best at lowering the temperature inside your house. For my experiment, I built three small houses with black shingles on the roof of each. On each house I cut out three rectangular holes to insert a piece of glass in each with caulking. In the first house, I tested clear, non-tinted glass windows. The second house tested non-heat reflective tinted glass windows; in which I used a spray bottle and soapy water to easily lay the tint down on the inside of the window. The last house tested heat reflective tinted glass windows; therefore I used the same process of installing the tint. Then I used three clamp heat lamps to hang over the house to be tested. I tested each house one at a time under the lamps for ten trials every fifteen minutes. I then waited thirty minutes for the heat lights to cool down to their normal temperature and began to test the next house. I used the same procedure with the third house. After receiving my results I collected them in a chart and graphs.<br><br> During my experiment, I found out that by using heat reflective glass, the temperature inside your house will be lowered. The non-heat reflective glass cooled the house also, but not as much as the heat reflective house. Although, there was a large difference in temperatures between the clear, non-tinted glass and the non-reflective/reflective glasses.

NUTS ABOUT ENERGY
Ashlynn Marie Thomas
Lutcher High School, Lutcher, LA, USA

In order to obtain caloric values similar to accepted values for different types of nuts (peanuts, walnuts, almonds, etc.), a calorimeter was constructed and numerous trials for each nut were run using different heat-absorbing substances in the calorimeter. The data was compiled into tabular form and statistical analyses were performed to see which substance produced results closest to the accepted values having the lowest standard deviation. At present, more trials are being conducted. The results from these new trials must be placed into the data sets before definitive results can be obtained.

USING INFARED TECHNOLOGY TO MAP AIR VELOCITY ACCLERERATION RATES OVER THE SURFACE OF THE SLOW-FLIGHT AIRFOIL.
Drew A Papke
Wildwood Highschool, Wildwood, Fl, U.S.A

The research believes that modern day wind tunnels are accurate for studying the aerodynamic behavior of objects but not for directly analyzing or viewing the air behavior over various objects. The researcher believes that it will be more accurate to use infrared temperature readings of surface temperatures of an airfoil during flight to be able to analyze air acceleration rates over the surface of an airfoil or other objects. To test this theory the researcher constructed a wind tunnel that’s capable of housing an infrared camera.<br><br> The researcher placed a warm slow-flight airfoil similar to the NACA 2415 into the wind tunnel. The researcher took images of the airfoil 2 sec. after airflow simulation initiation and at 15. Sec. intervals after initiation. The images were cataloged into a 3-letter system for future analysis. After obtaining the images they were analyzed to search for temperature variations that indicate air velocity rate changes between the airfoil's 17 "zones" or lateral sections of the airfoil that lay parallel with the leading edge.<br><br> Extracted data from the images supports the researcher's hypothesis. The velocity rates were mapped by recording the temperature difference from group to group (delta-t). In trial D.A.1 the temperature difference between group 1 and the groups in progression increased on an average of 1 degree through the progression of groups leading to the trailing edge. By comparing these changes and rates it is possible to accurately map air velocity acceleration rates at different sections of the airfoil for comparison.<br><br>

A VIBROACOUSTICAL STUDY COMPARING THE OUT-OF-PLANE MOTION OF VIOLIN BRIDGES USING MODAL ANALYSIS
Emily Rae Drabek
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN, USA

Modal Analysis is a method used to animate vibrational modes. Nodal lines, defining areas in a structure’s vibration, can be found once modes are determined. This project was designed to determine the vibrational patterns of an ebony-embedded violin bridge and a regular, wooden violin bridge using Modal Analysis. It was hypothesized if the out-of-plane vibrational patterns of an ebony-embedded violin bridge and a regular, wooden violin bridge were compared using Modal Analysis, then there would be a difference in their vibrational modes. A manually operated impact hammer, including a force transducer, was used to strike the bridge at 33 pre-selected points where a small microphone picked up the sound and sent it to a PC computer. A DOS loaded Wavepack program then acted as a dual-channel Fast Fourier Transform analyzer, or FFT. Channel X of the FFT was connected with the impact hammer and channel Y was connected to the microphone; the ratio of channel X and channel Y was a transfer function. An average for each point was found after it was struck four times. Transfer functions were sent to the modal analysis program where peaks were analyzed and curve fitted, resulting in modal animation. Nodal lines were then identified. Modes one and two of both bridges were identical. Mode three, however, had a nodal line that was slightly higher on the ebony-embedded bridge. Mode frequency suggested that this difference in mode three could be due to the added mass of the ebony. Based on the data collected, the hypothesis was supported.

INVESTIGATIONS OF A ROTATING FLUID PHENOMENON
Adreanne Laree Brungardt
Brush High School, Brush, Colorado, USA

Rotating fluids have bedazzled people and intrigued the scientist for generations. The Earth’s rotation hinders the scientist from formulating and estimating the motions in a system which is rotating. The description of such phenomena such as the formation of thunderstorms to the circulation of oceanic currents to the formation of galaxies requires that the scientist have a fundamental understanding of the effects of rotation on fluids. The purpose of this project is two-fold. First, to investigate and isolate the major factor which contributes to the slowing of a shaken pop can rolling down an incline. Second, to formulate a feasible and plausible model which describes the motion of the shaken pop can as it moves down an incline. Cans filled with various fluids were rolled down an incline and timed. An experimental model was developed. Trials using this model were digitized and results analyzed. Analysis of video indicates that a greater number of small bubbles are formed when the container is shaken. From a theoretical point of view, the existence of bubbles accommodates a compelling justification to explain the slowing phenomenon observed in the solutions with viscosity near water. The action of shaking results in the increase of bubbles present, which indirectly accounts for the slowing phenomenon. The propagation of bubbles augments the interaction of the bubbles with the rotating liquid. This in turn slows the rotating liquid and container.<br><br>

DYNAMIC HOLOGRAPHY IN PHOTOREFRACTIVE POLYMER COMPOSITES WITH METAL NANOPARTICLES
Elysa Wolf Chao
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

The photorefractive (PR) effect involves a non-uniform light-induced change in the index of refraction of a material due to a photo-induced redistribution of charge, and is useful in a number of image processing applications. This is a study of the potential improvement in photorefractive response time and diffraction efficiency due to the presence of gold nanoparticles in photorefractive polymer composites. The other materials in the composites were polyvinyl carbazole as a photoconductive polymer, C as a sensitizer, a nonlinear chromophore, and a plasticizer. The PR effect in the samples was studied using a four wave mixing set-up in which two writing beams interfere in the sample which leads to the PR effect and the diffraction of the probe beam. Each measurement was run by applying an electric field and then allowing the writing beams in the setup to interfere in the sample. The intensity of the resulting diffracted beam was recorded as a function of time. Results show that the diffraction efficiency increased two to three times depending on the applied electric field. The photorefractive response time decreased by a factor of three. These effects are thought to be the result of the nanoparticles concentrating the electric fields which would increase the amount of charge generated by the laser light and/or increase the electric field effect on the chromophore. It is also possible that the nanoparticles alter the trapping of charge. The results show that the nanoparticles aid in the creation of the diffraction grating within the polymer composites studied.

ANTIBUBBLES: THE SEARCH FOR PRACTICAL USE
Michael J. Pizer
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53217, USA

Antibubbles, a long known but little studied scientific oddity, were the subject of this research. Antibubbles are spherical air shells surrounding a liquid in a liquid. Early research determined that antibubbles have a critical depth—the maximum depth to which they can survive—and this limits their usefulness. Pressure is the dominant factor affecting this critical depth, and this research focused on attempting to increase the critical depth to useful levels through pressure manipulations.<br><br> An automated antibubble generator that created consistently sized antibubbles at nearly 100% efficiency was designed and built, along with a pressure chamber. For the first time, production of antibubbles was mechanized. Three types of experiments were conducted using the antibubble generator and pressure chamber. First, antibubbles were created under constant pressure throughout their entire lives. Second, external pressure was varied after antibubble formation. Third, only the formation pressure of antibubbles was altered.<br><br> Research revealed that the critical depth of antibubbles can be controlled by manipulating either the formation or external pressure. Greater formation pressure increased critical depth, while greater external pressure decreased critical depth. The critical depths of antibubbles respond to small changes in pressure, and it was shown that they could be used as a sensitive indicator of barometric pressure. Finally, this research supports the exciting possibility of using antibubbles as chemical delivery mechanisms in lakes and ponds. Antibubbles can now move from being simply a scientific oddity to become a useful scientific tool. <br><br>

SPATIALLY FRACTIONATED RADIATION (GRID) BEAM DOSIMETRY USING FILM AND TLD
Navid John Meigooni
Henry Clay High School, Lexington, KY, USA

Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (GRID) is used in the treatment of large and bulky cancer tumors. Several investigators have shown that GRID therapy not only maximizes the dose to the tumor, but also minimizes the dose to the normal tissue, which reduces the chance of complication for the patient. In this project, dosimetric characteristics of the external beam GRID therapy for a recently fabricated GRID block have been investigated. These investigations were preformed using film and Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) dosimetry techniques. The tissue equivalent phantom materials were accurately machined to accommodate the films and TLDs at different depths. The films were exposed for 10x10 cm2 and 20x20 cm2 radiation field size using 6MV and 18MV X-ray beam from a Varian 2100 EX Linear Accelerator. The responses for the films were read using a Lumus 50 Laser Scanner and the responses for the TLDs were read using a Harshaw 3500 TLD Reader. These responses were converted to dose by calibrating samples of films and TLDs using a calibrated X-ray machine with a calibration setup. The results showed that the dose rate at the center of the grid hole for 6MV and 18MV were 0.832 ± 5% and 0.691 ± 5%, respectively. Moreover, the dose rate in the shadow of the block for 6MV and 18MV were 0.07 ± 5% and 0.118 ± 5%, respectively. A comparison between film and TLD dosimetry had shown an excellent agreement between these two techniques. However, film provides a higher spatial resolution dosimetry than TLD.

NOVEL MODELING OF CRYSTALLINE GRAINS IN SOLAR CELLS BASED ON THIN FILMS OF SILICON
Ondrej Certik
Gymnazium Christiana Dopplera, Zborovska 45, Prague, Czech Republic

In the near future, solar cells will become an important renewable energy resource whose operation does not produce any pollution. Cells based on thin films of silicon can be produced with less energy than the most widespread wafer cells. <br><br> I have investigated growth, morphology and some electrical properties of microcrystalline grains contained in silicon thin films. I simulated growth of such grains by Monte Carlo method and studied morphology of grains.<br><br> I found the rules for atom absorption, migration and binding, which produced simulated grains similar to the conical grains really observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The apex angle of the simulated grains depends on the probabilities of microscopic steps and its comparison with experimentally observed angles could be used to study atomic scale processes that are experimentally inaccessible. <br><br> I also created a program for solving Laplace equation with the relaxation method. The result was the distribution of electric potential within the thin film. By taking a gradient of electric potential, I could compute electric field and current density within the film. I have observed the field concentration near the tip of the crystalline grain that could be important for the operation of the solar cells.

THRUST OPTIMIZATION OF ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITORS
Evan Eric Frank
DuPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY U.S.A.

When high potential, low current electrical energy [>18KV, <10mA DC] is applied to an Asymmetrical Capacitor [AC] module, thrust is produced using no moving parts or fuel! The capacitor can be nearly any combination of two electrodes, asymmetrical in size and separated by a dielectric. <br><br>Last years’ research confirmed these devices produced low levels of thrust by using a linear test setup. Frictional resistance and error prone evaluations prevented any meaningful effort to optimize these devices. <br><br>I designed a new test apparatus that directly allows thrust and power consumption of AC’s to be recorded by computer in real time. PC controlled strain gauge use around AC’s has not previously been reported in part due to the high levels of RFI and EMI [electrical noise] produced by these devices. I successfully protected all the necessary equipment to allow automated data gathering. <br><br> My project goal was to discover the key variables that control thrust output and efficiency of AC’s by analyzing different device configurations. This approach allowed the devices’ thrust and power consumption to be both quantified and optimized. <br><br>This approach allowed me to report:<br><br>1. The first evidence that these devices produce oppositely directed low levels of thrust at low voltage levels [>4KV & <18KV].<br><br>2. Power consumption increases exponentially with voltage.<br><br>3. The preferred mode of operation is to ground the largest electrode,<br><br>4. Thrust increases linearly with both increased device diameter and applied voltage.<br><br>5.

ATTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES: USING FILTERS TO REDUCE NOISE
Courtney Dianne Maxson
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA

Three AM radio stations are causing harmful interference with amateur radio equipment on the USS KIDD museum ship in Baton Rouge, LA. Harmful interference is unwanted noise caused by another frequency source that results in serious degradation of the desired frequency. In the beginning of this experiment, it was thought that there was only one intrusive AM station; however, further testing proved this wrong and identified two other problematic stations.<br><br> Different types of filters were researched then designed using a circuit-modeling program called “5Spice”. Tests were run with the energy-reject filter selected as the best option, and the series-tuned filter chosen as the constant. Both designs were modified based on model runs until the expected results were obtained. Once filter components were inventoried and acquired, both filters were built, and then taken to the USS KIDD for testing. The filters functioned well, as expected. The series-tuned filter only attenuates one frequency; its range is not wide or deep enough to have an effect on the other two AM stations. The energy-reject filter; however, worked perfectly. It attenuates all three stations about 40dB, yet does not have a negative effect on the 20-meter and 40-meter amateur radio bands.<br><br> Except for two unexpected hindering AM stations, the results were as predicted. Even with three interfering stations, a filter design was achieved. The research hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected.

LASER ACOUSTIC MATERIALS ANALYSIS
Kevin E Claytor
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, New Mexico (NM), United States

Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) has been widely developed and used as an accurate technique for material composition, structural, and fatigue analysis. However, most of the previous methods have relied on sample contact, both for signal generation and reception. This project, however, takes a novel approach to this analysis. Using an unfocused, high power laser to generate an acoustic signal in the material has been achieved in this investigation, and does not damage the material or require contact with it. Likewise, acoustic signals can be created in the material by laser ablation; however, this removes a small portion of the material. Interestingly enough, this project has shown that the signal amplitudes generated by these two methods are only a factor of two different, despite a large difference in laser power intensity. Although piezoelectric transducers were used in this experiment, purely for economical and bandwidth reasons, the transition to a laser vibrometer (a non-contact sensor) would be feasible given the large amplitudes produced. All waveforms were analyzed using a Fourier transform and a time shifted Fourier transform. Unlike RUS, a single laser pulse covers a wide range of frequencies, allowing for greater frequency analysis in a much shorter time span. In addition to materials characterization by acoustic waves generated in the sample, this project has also shown that the acoustic waves produced by the plasma plume from laser ablation can also be used to characterize the material. Plasma acoustic generation, thermoelastic wave generation, and ablation hold promise for fast, non-contact materials analysis.

DOES REPEATED HEATING OF MOTOR OIL AFFECT VISCOSITY?
Nick Head
Ensweiler Academy, Gary, IN, USA

Does oil really get thinner when it is heated? There are many different types of oils, some thin with less viscosity and some thicker with high viscosity. When you put oil into your car it is important to know something about what goes on in the motor or block. <br><br> Have you ever noticed that your car starts more easily before you change the oil? All oils break down after a point and it then starts to lose its viscosity or thickness. As you drive down the road your motor is going more revolutions than your transmission and when the oil breaks down it puts wear and tear on nearly every part of the motor. This will cause bearings to wear out, valves to chatter, or even your motor to lock up. When oil breaks down it becomes very thin and you can tell that it is thinner by looking at it when you change oil. <br><br> Several oils were heated on the hot plate to 275 F and then cooled. The oil was then tested for viscosity. I then reheated the oil to 375 F, cooled it, and tested the viscosity again. The more expensive oils were more viscous to begin with and did not lose their viscosity when heated. The less expensive oils remained essentially the same.

THE EFFECTS OF SPIN ON A VOLLEYBALL
Kimberly Marie Sutterer
Terre Haute North Vigo High School

The purpose of this experiment was to analyze the effect of spin on a volleyball and how lift played a part. I tested three spins, top spin, back spin, and no spin. Spin, speed, and the angle of trajectory could be changed with the ball machine I used. I completed and recorded three shots of each spin at three different angles. I then made overlay plots of the trajectory of the ball onto graphs and analyzed my data. I looked at the actual and theoretical distances, the velocities, and lift. When I looked at the data I realized how big an effect lift actually has. From my data I determined topspin had an average lift of 1.127 m/s^2, backspin an average of 2.155 m/s^2, and no spin an average of 2.253 m/s^2. No spin had the most lift of the three, then backspin, then topspin. The sequence of these results did present some "Why did that happen?", questions because of what I learned from research. In conclusion lift affects a volleyball. Whether it is due to unknown error, or some part of a volleyball that doesn’t follow the laws of physics, there is more to study. This is definitely a project that could be continued and looked at in more depth. I also found that by putting a different spin on a volleyball it can be a great strategy to use when serving in a volleyball game.<br><br>

MECHANICAL WAVE MODULATION AND IT'S APPLICATION
Amruth Bagali Ravindranath
Sadvidya P U College, Mysore, Karnataka, India

Natural sources of mechanical waves are characterized by their energy per cycle, which depends on their amplitude. Their amplitudes are generally too low to be economically harnessed or too high to be put to constructive work. This project reports a method developed to modify the amplitude of mechanical waves so as to change their impact on the target. <br><br> <br><br>The primary objective of the project is to develop an effective shock absorbing system, by suitably decreasing the impact of the wave by modulating its amplitude.<br><br> <br><br>The basic system consists of coupled oscillators with the frequency of adjacent oscillators increasing by a constant value. This system causes the wave energy input at the low frequency end of the system to get modified so that at the high frequency end the output is in the form of a series of smaller impulses. Thus the system acts as a shock absorber. <br><br> <br><br>With further study it was found that this system can also be used to increase the amplitude of the incident wave. The system designed mainly for this, used fluids to propagate energy since the loss of pressure will be avoided.<br><br> <br><br>On the basis of the results obtained, this project also proposes models for some possible applications. These include better shock absorbers, better vibration isolation platforms, resonance control, and wave energy harnesser with unique features. It may also find applications in electricity generation from sources with presently unsuitable energy levels and the use of non-newtonian fluids as shock absorbers.<br><br>

USING AN IONIC MOTOR SET-UP TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE ANDRES PREDICTION OF THE MURIEL DRESDEN MICROSCOPIC THEORY OF TURBULENCE
Mark Leo Pioquinto Bejemino
Philippine Science High School WesternVisayas, Iloilo City, Iloilo, Philippines

Recently, a novel theory of turbulence known as the Muriel-Dresden Microscopic Theory of Turbulence (MDMTT) was proposed. <br><br> This study seems to confirm the Andres Prediction of the MDMTT on the Angular Velocity (w) versus Energy (E) Graph of the Ionic Motor Set-up (IMS) by showing the presence of multiple plateaus in the w vs E Graph of the IMS using three electrolyte solutions. <br><br> The Experiment was conducted with 5% HCl, 10% HCl and 5% NaCl. The w vs E Graphs of the 5% HCl, 10% HCl and 5% NaCl solutions were approximately square root functions interrupted by multiple plateaus. Four plateaus were observed in the w vs E Graph of 5% HCl. Three plateaus were observed in the w vs E Graph of 10% HCl as well as 5% NaCl. Distilled water was also used, which did not move nor rotate in the IMS.<br><br> The experimental results seem to confirm the Square root of (2n+1) Effect, the Concentration Effect and the Ionic Mass-Concentration Effect for the critical angular velocities. The results also seem to confirm the (2n+1) Effect and the Ionic Mass-Concentration Effect for the critical energies. The experimental results are inconclusive with regards to the Concentration Effect for the critical energies.<br><br>

CENTIGRADE 4.0: TURBULENT PENETRATIVE CONVECTION IN CHILLED WATER
Meredith Ann MacGregor
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO, USA

The existence of a maximum in the density of water at about 4 C makes it possible to construct an experiment for investigating the properties of turbulent, penetrative convection. A thermoelectric module, regulated by a simple proportional control circuit was used to cool the bottom of a cylindrical, water-filled container to slightly above 0 C, while the top was maintained at a fixed temperature above 20 C by a resistive heater. Convection occurred in a region occupying the lower 3/4 of the container where the water temperature was 4 C or less. Measurements made within this region using an adjustable thermistor probe showed how convection produced a cold (3 C), constant-temperature layer with an equilibrium thickness that varied inversely with the imposed top temperature. The average heat flux through the layer was estimated to be more than 17 times the amount that could be carried by thermal conduction alone. The convection was found to occur in the form of transient, buoyant, plumes of cold water that formed at different locations on the bottom of the container. The ascent of such a plume could cause localized temperature variations of as much as 2 C, depending on position in the layer. The largest temperature fluctuations (3-4 C) were detected in a thin layer of stable water at the top of the convection region where conditions were continuously variable. Estimates show that these disturbances are likely to be gravity waves, produced by plumes that reach the top of the convective layer and overshoot into the non-convective region above.

SUPERLUMINAL ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN THE NEAR-FIELD
Stephen Harold Ingraham
New Fairfield High School, New Fairfield CT, USA

Superluminal (faster-than-light) physics is currently a popular field of research, but definitive results indicating superluminal wave group velocities have eluded scientists. Group velocity is known to be the velocity of wave energy and information in most cases. One possible instance of a superluminal group velocity involves electromagnetic wave propagation in the near-field of an oscillating electric dipole. The theoretical analysis presented in this paper, which is based on classical electrodynamics theory derived from Maxwell’s equations, shows that the fields propagate many times faster than c in this region. An experiment was performed to confirm this result for the transverse electric field. A plot of phase versus distance from a dipole antenna was differentiated and substituted into the phase and group velocity equations. The results show that the phase and group velocities of the wave are clearly superluminal in the near-field. For example, at 0.1 wavelengths from the source, the group velocity of a 60 MHz wave was measured to be 10 times the speed of light. The relativistic consequences of this phenomenon and the possibility of sending superluminal signals are discussed.

JAVAPSI - SIMULATING AND VISUALIZING QUANTUM MECHANICS
Marcel Schmittfull
Celtis-Gymnasium Schweinfurt, Germany

The aim of this project is to simulate and visualize the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics with an interactive Java program. Almost all input data are modifiable by user interaction during runtime. In particular, the shape of the potential in which the particle 'lives' can be entered freely by mouse and the eigen functions are shown by selecting the corresponding energy eigen values. The program computes time-dependant or time-independent solutions, either of one-, two- or three-dimension Schrodinger equation. In the one-dimensional time-independent case the wave-function is numerically calculated by the Numerov algorithm, the energy eigen values are found by a shooting method. The complex-valued time-dependant wave-function, which is evaluated using the Goldberg-Schey-Schwartz algorithm, can either be animated or plotted as a function of space and time, whereby the real and imaginary parts are visualized using a color map.The wave-functions of a three-dimensional spherical potential are calculated by reducing the problem to the one-dimensional case using radial and spherical eigen functions and solving the problem again using Numerov's algorithm. Comparisons of the calculated wave-functions with analytical solutions of well-known potentials (e.g. free particle, simple boxes and walls, harmonic oscillator, etc.) are made and show the accuracy of the code. Especially, the program is suitable for educational purposes due to its ability to elucidate a large variety of quantum mechanical principles and effects, such as wave property of particles, tunnel effects, or the behavior in arbitrary potentials.<br><br>

NEAR INFRARED DETECTION OF PHYTOPHTHORA PALMIVORA INFECTION IN CARICA PAPAYA THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTISPECTRAL FLUORESCENCE IMAGING
Chelsey Lauren Villanueva
Kapolei High School, Kapolei, Hawaii, United States of America

This experiment set out to determine if a DuncanTech MS2100 multispectral camera could detect Phytophthora palmivora infection in Carica papaya before symptoms could be seen by the human eye. It was hypothesized that the near infrared (located between 650 – 1100 nm) photos would show signs of infection characterized by low leaf fluorescence before symptoms of infection could be seen by the human eye in the visible light range (400 – 650 nm). Photos were acquired by the camera and accompanying software DTControl FG in the visible light range and the near infrared (NIR) light range before and after C.papaya tissue culture samples were infected (inoculated) with a P.palmivora solution. Along with the multispectral photos, qualitative observations were performed and by hour 96.5 after inoculation, symptoms of infection were visually noted and the acquiring of photos ceased. After the experiment, the visible light range photos, NIR photos, and corresponding normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) photos, created by the ENVI 3.4 program, were printed and analyzed. A decrease in the NIR and NDVI fluorescences were observed among the infected C.papaya leaves in the tissue culture samples, but were accompanied by a decrease in the leaf color due to infection as recorded by the visible light photos. The camera was, therefore, unable to detect P.palmivora infection in the C.papaya tissue samples before it could be seen by the human eye and it was concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. <br><br>

A Scanning Tunnelling Microscope feels the surface of the sample with the help of an extremely fine tip. It belongs to the most important tools in the nanotechnology because it can make even partial atoms of a material surface visible. The peculiarity of my microscope is that you can achieve a resolution which is 1000fold better than with normal light microscopes. It is also possible to scan within the nanometre area. This corresponds to the resolution of an electron microscope. However, it works according to the principle of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope.<br><br>By lowering the costs, I was planning to make the tool accessible for a larger group of interested costumers.<br><br>Contrary to professional devices, which cost several 10,000 dollars, my expenses confined to 40-50 dollars. Such relation to the price and the resolution is unique.<br><br>With a STM, there are different components, which are working together. In order to achieve a price reduction, I had to test several other ones (different tips, software, mechanics to sink the tip slowly and electronics (for example a microcontroller version).<br><br>Filaments serve as a microscope tip and a pile of towels damps undesirable vibrations. A disk-piezo and a soldered electronic is used for the movement of the tip. I reached the biggest reduction in costs by the usage of a standard pc sound card for the digitization of the measuring signal.<br><br>

WHICH WAVELENGTH IS MOST EFFICIENT?
Carl Anthony Turner
New Prague High School, 221 12th St. N.E., New Prague, MN 56071

Audio signals can be carried as radio waves, through space, and as electrical pulses through wires. Other forms of electrical radiation, including light, can also carry audio signals. In this project we are able to actually listen to a beam of light. I am testing different visible wavelengths to find the most efficient wavelength. My hypothesis is that the higher the frequency the more efficient the wavelength will be. I thought that this would be the case because it has a shorter wavelength and it transmits faster than the longer wavelengths. The reason I think this is because the higher frequencies have more energy so I think that they will be more efficient. I set up different experiments, which gave me conclusive evidence that my hypothesis was not correct. The results where actually the exact opposite as my hypothesis. Instead of the higher frequencies being the most efficient wavelengths the lower ones were. One of the possible explanations for the longer wavelengths being more efficient, is the solar cell that I used. It is possible that the solar cell picked up the longer wavelengths better than the shorter ones. If I were to this project again, I would have to find more wavelengths of light to test, including inferred and ultraviolet lights. I would also make sure that my solar cell picked up all types of wavelengths the same amount.

SECURITY UPGRADE FOR DNA STEGANOGRAPHY USING STANDARD PAPER
Rachel Lisa Bayefsky-Anand
Solomon Schechter High School of New York, New York, NY 10024, USA

DNA steganography is a technique that conceals a secret-message oligonucleotide, whose codons represent letters, within a much larger amount of concealing, or genomic background DNA. This mix has been transmitted from the sender to the receiver via DNA microdots. DNA microdots have previously only been used on pure, filter paper. This study examines and alters the experimental conditions of DNA steganography in order to improve the security of the system. In this research, the DNA microdot scheme is used on standard paper by applying the results of experiments on the elution of DNA into water. Two methods are employed: elution and binding DNA to paper through baking and U-V crosslinking. While elution proves successful in enabling the decoding process to function with standard paper, attempts to bind DNA to paper are unsuccessful. When the inconspicuousness of the secret message within DNA steganography is maximized, through these and other improvements, DNA steganography provides a high level of security for encoded information.

THE CHARACTERISTIC AND INTERACTION OF VORTEXES GENERATED BY TWO APERTURES
Zheng-Wei Chen
National Tainan First Senior High School, Tainan, Taiwan

It has been known from everyday experience that vortexes produced by a single aperture¡Xthrough which water is drained from a tank by gravity¡Xdisplay different patterns as the diameter of the aperture and the water depth vary. However, little has been explored about twin vortexes. This study thus probes into the interaction of vortexes produced by two water-draining apertures. The experiments were recorded by a video camera; the inner and outer diameters of the vortexes were measured from the recorded images, and the data were further processed by a personal computer. In all experiments, the inner and outer diameters of the vortexes appeared to be somewhat in proportion. It was found, however, that at fixed water depth the two vortexes either tend to neutralize or to reinforce each other, depending upon the specific setup of the diameters of the two apertures and the distance between them. In particular, when the two apertures were close to each other, only one vortex was observed. The second vortex appeared as the distance between the two apertures was increased, but it was typically smaller in size. Also, the second vortex became weaker or even diminished when it was too close to the water inlet. A number of interesting phenomena regarding vortex sizes and patterns were observed.

TUNABLE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF MAGNETIC FLUID FILMS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Yun-Hsin Chao
Taipei Municipal Chien Kuo Senior High School, Taipei 100, Taiwan

Magnetic fluids show novel tunable optical properties, which can be potentially applied to electro-optical devices. The poor existing understanding of the refractive index motivated us to investigate the refractive index of the magnetic fluids. The refractive index of the magnetic fluid was observed to increase under an external magnetic field until it exceeds a critical strength. The relevant physical mechanism was then clarified. With the magnetically tunable refractive index of magnetic fluids, an innovative optical-fiber attenuator is designed. The attenuator consists of a bare fiber core surrounded with magnetic fluid. By manipulating the refractive index of the cladding, using magnetic fluid, the occurrence of a reflection at the core-cladding interface controls the transmitted intensity of a light. The attenuation can be enhanced by raising the field strength, enlarging the length of the bare-core section, or cascading in the attenuators. These results definitely demonstrate the tunability of the refractive index of magnetic fluid.

THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE ON THE NEMATIC PHASE OF A LIQUID CRYSTAL
ALIZA ILANA MALZ
Hunter College High School, New York, NY 10128, USA

Substances capable of forming liquid crystals change their molecular organization at extreme temperatures and pressures, limiting their use in optical display devices. With a long-term goal of furthering the design of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) used in deep-sea and space exploration, this project evaluated physical methods that can discriminate among gel, liquid crystal, and liquid phases. <br><br> The dynamic behavior of aqueous phospholipid dispersions was investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in order to test the suitability of this spectroscopic technique to identify a liquid crystalline phase. Phosphorous NMR line widths and spin-lattice relaxation times were measured for egg yolk lecithin (EYL), dilauryllecithin (DLL), and dipalmitoyllecithin (DPL) in liquid crystalline and gel phases at ambient pressure and four different temperatures. Measurements of self-diffusion coefficients at different pressures had limited signal strength that could be improved by increasing lipid concentration or switching from observation of phosphorous to hydrogen nuclei. By comparing the different phospholipids and using reference data for DPL phase transitions, it was demonstrated that both phosphorous NMR measurements reflected the relative mobilities of the compounds, were diagnostic for the phase state, and revealed the onset of a phase change as the temperature or pressure was varied.<br><br> In future work, NMR will be applied to monitor phase changes at extremes of pressure and temperature in substances known to exhibit the twisted or super-twisted nematic phases used in LCDs; the results should guide the design of materials that exhibit liquid crystalline properties in extreme environmental conditions.<br><br>

GENERATING GIANT PULSES THROUGH INTRACAVITY CHOPPING
William L. Hennessey
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas Sao Paulo, Brazil

The purpose of this project was to generate giant laser pulses through the application of Q-switching to a carbon dioxide laser. After analyzing possible techniques, intracavity chopping was chosen because of its relative ease of employment and adjustment. <br><br> In order to set the chopper a Brewster window was designed and installed according to Brewster’s Law in order to promote greater transmittance at the infrared level. Since a ZnSe window of desired length was not available, a smaller window was found and the designed suffered modifications which did not favor output. <br><br> With this setup two experiments were calculated. First, to test whether Q-switching was actually pulsing the laser. Second, the test of the influence that chopper frequency has over average output. The latter test investigated the average output because the available power meter could only measure average output, not peak power of pulses. <br><br> The first test did not produce valid results because laser output was not large enough. Drawback reasons for this include a small leakage in one of the laser gas valves and failure of one of the electrodes. From the second test, it was concluded that intracavity chopping decreases average output in relation to continuous operation output and that frequencies below 400 hertz could be a low frequency that would allow for the time during which Q is spoiled to grow the gain to a saturation level.<br><br> If this experiment were to be done again, a new Q-switching method or chopper would be employed to produce frequencies greater than 400 hertz. The expected behavior of average output as frequency increases would be of no change since average output is not influenced by chopper frequency, unless this is so low as to allow gain saturation or so high as to not allow much gain. Also, if a fast power meter were available, the Q-switched pulse could be observed through an oscilloscope and characterized.

SOUNDS OF SILENCE
Jessica Ann Goldstayn
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, Tennessee, United States of America

The main objective of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of creating a baffle that would effectively attenuate sound without creating excess backpressure. This was done in comparison to two other commercially available baffles.<br><br> This experiment was conducted using a 1” sound pressure level microphone, a 1/4" sound pressure level microphone, a 5/16” pitot probe, a high pressure air jet blow down facility, a manometer, lab view software, and four baffle configurations. Initial decibel level data was taken off an automobile exhaust. The air jet was set to emulate these properties using a power drill to pulse the airflow to create the lower frequencies. The configurations were then tested for backpressure and decibel level. The results were then plotted and analyzed based on the number of decibels per Hertz. <br><br> The two commercially available baffles were comparable in sound cancellation; however, one had significantly more backpressure as a result of the geometry of the internal cyclonic divisions. The experimental baffle surpassed both commercial baffles in noise attenuation and minimal backpressure. However, the experimental baffle did have a flaw in that it allowed frequencies that were multiples of 39Hz to pass through freely.<br><br> The experiment was successful in that it accomplished the set objectives. It could be continued by modeling the airflow and the cavity using computer software to determine placement of smaller internal obstructions to eliminate the sound frequencies that pass through. Upon completion of this task, the baffle could then be marketed to any of the existing exhaust manufacturers. <br><br>

CENTRIFUGAL RED SHIFT OF LIGHT
David Robert Hagen
Ayersville High School, Defiance, OH, United States

This project was an investigation into the red shift of light in a centrifuge according to the General Theory of Relativity and the Equivalence Principle. This project attempted to prove that red shift occurs in a centrifuge and that the red shift is equivalent to the red shift caused by gravity. A centrifuge approximately two feet in radius was constructed to hold a laser on the outside edge. The laser beam traveled to the center where it reflected off of a mirror along the axis of rotation. A beam splitter above the centrifuge combined the beam with a second laser beam from a similar laser. Together, these beams were shown onto an intensity interferometer. No interference pattern was detected, probably due to the fact that the red shift never overcame the linewidth of the lasers.<br><br> A mathematical approach was used to show that red shift in a centrifuge could be approximated using the geometry of the motion in a centrifuge. The geometric approximation was accurate to seven digits when compared to the standard equation using reasonable values for radius, frequency, and the laser wavelength.<br><br> Providing additional evidence of General Relativity and insight into the Equivalence Principle is important since space travel and the Global Positioning System are just a couple of the areas that rely on General Relativity. The Equivalence Principle allows centrifuges to investigate high gravitational environments without actually traveling to a massive body. <br><br>

DETERMINING PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONSTANTS OF SPUTTERED URANIUM AND THORIUM AS EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET THIN FILM REFLECTORS
Richard Winston Larson
Provo High School, Provo, Utah, United States of America

Uranium and thorium in the thin film form are effective reflectors of Extreme Ultraviolet Light (EUV). The purpose of this project was to study the composition, density, lattice structure, and roughness of sputtered uranium and thorium thin films and then study the effect of these characteristics on the reflectance of these same thin films. Thorium, uranium nitride, and uranium oxide were studied.<br><br> The samples were sputtered using RF Magnetron sputtering. Diffraction patterns were obtained using the Transmission Electron Microscope and analyzed using Bragg’s Law. It was found that the thorium samples are thorium metal, the uranium nitride samples are uranium mononitride, and the uranium oxide samples are uranium dioxide. Uranium mononitride was the densest, thorium metal the second densest, and uranium dioxide the least dense. The denser the sample the higher the reflectance. All compounds were found to have a face-centered cubic lattice structure.<br><br> The Atomic Force Microscope was used to obtain root mean square roughness data and power spectral density data. The RMS roughness was analyzed using the Debye-Waller method and the Nevot-Croce method. The results were then averaged to obtain good estimates of the decrease in reflectance. Uranium mononitride decreased 10%, thorium metal decreased 20%, and uranium dioxide decreased 40%. The rougher the sample, the lower the reflectance. Most of the roughness was high frequency roughness.<br><br> Based on roughness and crystal structure, uranium mononitride is the best reflector, thorium metal the second best reflector, and uranium dioxide the worst reflector.<br><br>

TWO NOVEL CAPILLARY-BASED FLUID VISCOMETERS
Yu-hsuan Cheng
Taipei Municipal Li Shan Senior High School, Taipei, Taiwan

The viscosity is one of the most important parameters of the fluids. In conventional viscosity experiments, capillary-based viscometers are widely adopted because of their user-ready devices and moderate prices. However, to accurately measure the viscosity, the fluid velocity must be kept constant; otherwise, the fluctuation may cause the serious deviation. Besides, traditional capillary viscometers often require a long time to make the measurement. <br><br> This research aims at exploring the capillary fluid mechanics and developing accurate and rapid methods to measure the viscosity. In this study, we developed two creative viscosity-measuring methods, the gravity sloping helical structure and the gradational liquid-level difference, and constructed two cost-effective capillary viscometer prototypes accordingly. The gravity sloping helical structure employs a long helical capillary as the flow channel and utilizes the gravity force to keep the fluid velocity extremely constant. The highlight of this method is that we can see the fluid flow through the capillary directly. On the other hand, the gradational liquid-level difference method uses the pressure sensors to precisely monitor the liquid-level difference, which drives the flow in the capillary, and allows automatic measurement of viscosity.<br><br> Compared with computer simulation, the experimental results agreed well with the theoretical values. The gravity sloping helical and gradational liquid-level difference methods achieve 0.5% and 0.8% accuracy respectively. In addition, the automation of viscosity sensing also greatly facilitates the viscosity measurement. Furthermore, these two methods are both valuable for incorporating into educational purpose and industrial application.<br><br>

A DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE: A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF MOVING OBJECTS ON THE EARTH'S ELECTRIC FIELD
Sean Thomas Malone
Malone Homeschool, Edgewood, NM, USA

The purpose of my project is to determine the effects of moving objects on the electric field surrounding the earth.<br><br> The potential difference between a point in the air and the ground is approximately 100 V/m, but very little current flows because of the high impedance of air. When a conducting object moves by the sensor, it shunts the voltage to a near-ground level, producing a fluctuation in the local electric field. I built a sensor to detect this fluctuation.<br><br> I hypothesized that the amplitude of the signal produced by a human jogging or walking by the sensor would vary inversely with the distance from the sensor and that the frequency of the signal would match that of the subject’s footsteps. I also thought that the amplitude would be greater when the subject is jogging than when the subject is walking.<br><br> The subject walked/jogged by the electric field sensor at various minimum distances from the sensor, and I recorded the waveform produced on a data logger. I took two data runs for each distance/movement type.<br><br> The amplitude of the signal varied inversely with the square of the distance from the sensor. The frequency of the signal did match that of the subject’s footsteps. The amplitude was greater when the subject was jogging than when the subject was walking. I am currently investigating the effects of various other moving objects on the earth’s electric field.<br><br> This has many applications, in both security and military use, as a personnel and vehicle detector. <br><br>

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: THE EFFECT OF THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH A SUPERCONDUCTOR ON THE RESISTIVITY-TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIP
Jonathan Joseph Naber
Waterloo High School, Waterloo, Illinois, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of the level of current flowing through a superconductor on the resistivity-temperature relationship, specifically critical temperature. A YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) superconductor with attached current and voltage drop electrodes (to calculate resistance) and a thermocouple (to measure the temperature of the superconductor) was used in the experiment. An amplification circuit that multiplied the thermocouple voltage and voltage drop readings from the superconductor by 100 times was built and calibrated to increase the resolution of the voltage readings. The current levels were varied by limiting the electric current supplied by a six volt battery with the following power resistors: 100, 50, 25, 16.667 and 12.5 ohms. Three trials were performed for each of the five current levels, which consisted of cooling the superconductor with liquid nitrogen and then allowing the superconductor to warm gradually, while recording data from the voltmeters which showed the temperature, resistance and current measurements. For each of the fifteen trials, the first temperature at which resistance had significantly jumped was noted. This indicated the loss of superconductivity, and therefore the critical temperature. The mean critical temperature for each of the five current levels was found, and varied from 96.2°K at the lowest current of 60 mA to 92.1°K at the highest current of 393 mA. The results provide substantial proof of the hypothesis that the amount of current flowing through a superconductor inversely affects the critical temperature.

IMPULSE OF PAINTBALLS PART II
William Ryan Roth
Taylorville High School, Taylorville, IL , USA

They make their way across a small patch of woods. Listening to every noise, scanning the trees in front of them for movement, they close in on their enemy. Shots ring out from the brush to their right. They are not soldiers but players, and this is not a battle but a game of paintball.<br><br> Whether the battle is real or a sport, industries have demand for gear that not only protects one from injury, but provides an edge on the field. To find an ideal pad for a paintball vest one must first measure the impact forces.<br><br> Impact forces were measured for pads of various materials, thickness, and density with a test apparatus constructed using a vertically mounted hollow plastic tube with a photogate attached across the tube, and a fixed force probe at the bottom. The photogate with LabPro interface was used to record the velocity of a free falling mass prior to impact. A Calculator-based Lab and software program measured impact forces.<br><br> Newton's Second Law states that the impulse of a moving object is equal to the magnitude of the object's change in momentum. Forces of impact are dependent on the time over which an object changes its velocity. Increasing the thickness of the fiberfill shows a mutual decrease in the impact force for both densities. An 11cm pad with density of .085 grams per cubic cm is the most practical choice for use as a protective paintball vest.<br><br>

PERIODICITY OF COMPLEX PENDULUMS
Brandon John Campbell
Wahlquist Junior High, Ogden, Utah

This project investigates the periodic behavior of a pendulum in a nonlinear forcing field. Other researchers suggest that chaotic behavior is associated with irregular periods. Several researchers have found that chaos is induced in a pendulum by placing magnets around it. This experiment measures the periodicity of a pendulum with several configurations of magnets. <br><br>The experiment was conducted by securing a light source to the pendulum and recording swings with varying configurations of magnets. The data was recorded on video then loaded onto a computer. The coordinates of the pendulum's position in each frame were determined. Periods were identified by locating velocity minima. The data show that the configuration of two attractors produced the most random swings. Data also showed that the pendulum trials with magnets (as opposed to the pendulum trial without magnets) were losing energy rapidly. A hypothesis was formed that the pendulum was losing energy because it was wobbling as it passed over magnets. The experiment was re-conducted, securing the pendulum to prevent wobbling. Results showed that the pendulum retained energy longer. Concluded that the pendulum lost energy due to wobbling.<br><br>

PSCS - PULSED SCANNING COMBINATIVE SPECTRUM
Xin Chen
The Affiliated High School of South China Normal University

As the main source of energy for plants in traditional opinion, sunlight is one of the most important factors for plants growth. Can we substitute a low-energy light for sunlight when we grow plants? In our research, we designed and construct a special device to perform a new light environment, the PSCS-pulsed scanning combinative spectrum, where the illumination is from 0 to 3330lux, under 5% that of the sunlight in average. <br><br>After collecting the situations of plants' growth under different light environment, we find that the PSCS can make plants grow better and faster than others grown under natural sunlight or artificial lamp. The PSCS make plants higher and stronger, grow larger and thicker leaves and produce more organic matter in total while sugar and protein per gram is reduced. We also notice that PSCS is helpful for the self-healing of diseased plants.<br><br>On the other hand, residue of pesticide is reduced faster by 11.9% to 34.5% by PSCS. <br><br>We suggest that light would provide plants not only the energy they need but also a signal to make them grow. For the characteristic it has, the PSCS is one of the signals that make plants grow better. A PSCS signal may help the plants make full use of the energy ATP£¬makes many significant enzymes more active and cause the light signal transport system inside to transport light signals faster.<br><br>Further study would be done to apply PSCS into the industry of agriculture in China.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ACOUSTIC PRESSURE DISTURBANCES ON REFRACTION OF VISIBLE LIGHT IN GASES
Alexander William Dillard
Bradshaw High School; Florence, AL 35630; United States of America

It has been found possible in recent studies of acoustic pressure nodes in gases that quite significant levels of pressure differentials are inducible. Researchers have used these pressure differentials to aid in such tasks as concentrating many fine particles or suspending small objects. The bulk of this research has predominantly focused on kinetic anomalies of these pressure nodes. Any effects that acoustic disturbances have on the optical properties of gases seem to have been comparatively ignored. The purpose of this study is to determine if significant refractive gradients can be induced in gases as a result of acoustic pressure waves. This information could be useful in creating a much lighter and more electronically controllable type of optics than is currently available with solid-state lenses. First, computer simulations were written and used to determine what configuration of test device would prove most useful for detection of this effect. Then an actual test apparatus was constructed based on the results of the computer simulations. Experiments were conducted to test the computer simulations and provide data for possible refinement of the technique.

CONCRETE: REPLACING SAND AGGREGATE WITH CENOSPHERES
Brandi Renee Boney
Demopolis High School, Demopolis, AL, USA

Cenospheres have recently been investigated for industrial use because of their lightweight, free-flowing, heat-resistant properties. I decided to investigate their ability to increase the strength of a concrete block. My hypothesis states that adding cenospheres to a cement mixture will increase the strength of the blocks until its composition reaches 50% cenospheres. A mixture consisting of more than 50% cenospheres will show a reduction in its strength. I started my experiment by making 11 different samples of concrete. Each sample consisted of a percentage of cenospheres in multiples of 10 ranging from 10% to 100%. I also set up a control containing no cenospheres. Following the standard procedures for ASTM, I created dozens of concrete blocks for testing. I picked 5 of the best blocks from each sample to test at Cemex (local cement plant). My control sample averaged a pressure strength of 3921 lb/in², samples containing 50% cenospheres averaged 1298 lb/in², and my 100% cenosphere sample averaged a strength of 758 lb/in². As my numbers show there was a continual decrease in the strength of my blocks. I used a line graph to display the averages for each sample to clearly show a relationship between cenosphere concentration and a decrease in strength.

DEVIATIONS FROM AN ISOTROPIC AND HOMOGENEOUS EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE
Ilya Gurwich
Amit State Religious/Municipal Comprehensive School, Beer-Sheva, Israel

The first solution to Einstein’s equation was published by Friedman in 1922. It was the cosmological solution, describing the expansion of the universe, and was based on the assumption that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous. Scientists are well known for their first commandment: “If it works, don’t fix it,” and for that reason, Friedman’s solution prevailed for a very long time. Already in the 1960s, a problem in Friedman’s model was discovered: apparently, the universe expands as if it contained 10 times the amount of matter we see. The above problem was ignored, since it was claimed that 90% of the matter in the universe does not radiate and therefore we are unable to see it. It was called “dark matter”. Recently, however, a new problem has come to light: it seems that something we do not see exerts an effect on the expansion that is twice as strong as the dark matter. This time, non-radiating matter is not an option, because this energy causes the universe to accelerate its expansion, which means that it is causing “anti-gravity”.<br><br>As a result of the above problem, there were many attempts to generalize/change Einstein’s theory of relativity (strings, branes, etc.), but there were almost no attempts to question Friedman’s assumptions.<br><br>We all know that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous on the large scale. That statement is refuted, however, when dealing with galaxies or even clusters of galaxies.<br><br>In this article, my aim is to introduce small anisotropic and inhomogeneous deviations into the matter and the metric of the universe, examine their behavior (theoretically), and then determine whether they can affect our cosmological observations or other physical phenomena.<br><br>

MULTICHANNEL DISCHARGE WITH LIQUID CATHODE
Almaz Fivzatovich Gaysin 
Secondary school # 49 , Kazan, Republic Tatarstan, Russia

The structure and features of multichannel discharges between metal anode (solid, hollow, spicate) and electrolyte cathode at atmospheric pressure are investigated experimentally. The characteristic features and types of free multichannel discharges with electrolyte cathode and their interchanges are revealed. The analysis and generalization of experimental data allowed to discover main physical processes responsible for sustaining of multichannel discharges with electrolyte cathode. The multichannel discharge with liquid nonmetallic cathode at atmospheric pressure consisting of large number of microdischarges can readily be regarded as a “spatial discharge”. It is established that the most stable geometrical, electrical, and thermal discharge characteristics are realized in a multichannel discharge with nonmetallic cathode. The discharge voltage is shown to change weakly with current increase. This is explained by that the increase of current leads to increasing of the number of microdischarges. The potential and electric field strength distribution in plasma column is of uniform character. The cathode potential fall on the liquid cathode is about 700 V. The current density on the liquid cathode significantly depend on the electrolyte composition and concentration and the interectrode distance.It is established that at small interelectrode distances the multichannel discharge has a technological effect of treatment of the surface of metallic anode. The multichannel discharge is used for purifying, polishing, and strengthening of metal and semiconductor surfaces; in obtaining powders from carbonated and instrumental steels; in synthesis of organic substances in electrolyte solutions; in sterilizing solutions and samples; for activating and purifying of water.

MAGNETIC FIELDS AND FERROFLUID DENSITY
Patricia Taylor Thompson
Memorial High School, Victoria, TX, U.S.A.

Purpose: To determine whether or not ferrofluid density increases when the magnetic field in proximity is intensified.<br><br>Hypothesis: The density of ferrofluid increases as the magnetic field in proximity is intensified.<br><br>Procedure: The experiment was conducted as follows:<br><br>Supplies were gathered and organized and 200 mL of ferrofluid was poured into a cylindrical, nonmetal container. Without magnets attached, the glass marble was placed in “drop” position and released simultaneously as a stopwatch timer commenced. Once the marble clicked onto the bottom of the jar, the timer was stopped. This process was repeated four times totaling five trials. Results were recorded. The ferrofluid was poured into the separate plastic container with a spout in order to extract the marble. Then the ferrofluid was poured back into the original cylindrical container.<br><br>Fifteen uniformly sized magnets were secured onto the container using electrical tape by means of precisely measured distances and attachment methods. The marble drop was repeated with the taped ferrofluid container, followed by recording data, extracting the marble, and refilling the original container. These steps were repeated 3 more times with 15 magnets being added each time, allowing a 30 magnet trial, a 45 magnet trial, and a 60 magnet trial in addition to the 0 magnet and 15 magnet trials, totaling 5 separate trials. A conclusion was derived from the data recorded. All supplies were then properly cleaned and safely stored. <br><br>Conclusion: Ferrofluid density increases as the magnetic field in proximity is intensified. <br><br>

WHAT IS THE BEST SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR SUPPLYING PEAK DEMANDS UNDER EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS?
Sudheer V. Earanky
Stanton College Preparatory, Jacksonville, Florida, USA

The purpose of the project was to find a power source alternate to secondary power sources that can perform under extreme environmental conditions. This research can lead to the possible discovery of possible alternatives to secondary power sources.<br><br> In order to conduct this experiment two ultracapacitor banks were formed, one for the equivalency of a lead acid battery (18 ultracapacitors) and the other for the equivalency of a nickel-cadmium battery (24 ultracapacitors). In the fisrt experiment the battery was charged to its maximum voltage and the ultracapacitor bank was also charged to a similar voltage. In the second experiment the battery and the ultracapacitor bank were discharged to minimum voltage and the time recorded along with the voltage and the current. In the next experiment the battery and the ultracapacitor were subjected to -15 degrees Celcius and both they were charged and discharged. The voltage and current were recorded for both of the tests. The next series of tests was the cordless phone tests in which the ultracapacitor bank was compared to the nickel-cadmium battery. These tests also included the fast charge tests, which involved the ultracapacitor bank being charged with charging resistors of 39, 10 and 5 ohms. <br><br> In conclusion, the results showed that at room temperature the secondary power source can hold more power for a longer period of time then the ultracapacitor bank. With the fast charge tests it showed that the ultracapacitor can be charged with a high current and not suffer any loss of capacitance. <br><br>

A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR THE QUANTIFICATION OF TRAPPING FORCES IN OPTICAL TWEEZERS
Yiyi Deng
Ward Melville High School, East Setauket, New York, United States

Optical tweezers, the experimental realization of science fiction’s tractor beam, consists of a sharply focused laser beam capable of non-invasive manipulation of dielectric nanoparticles. Theoretically operative by radiation pressure, optical tweezers are employed in chromosome dissection, kinetic studies of DNA, controlled cell fusion, cell microsurgery, in vitro fertilization, force measurements of cellular transport and adhesion. Precise determination of forces exerted by optical tweezers can be applied in the elimination of cancerous cells and description of protein folding.<br><br> Current optical tweezers force quantifiers require expensive equipment, labor-intensive calibration and do not account for conditions of low-power optical tweezers (mW lasers). Using a LT024 20mW 780 nm diode laser and a 1000x oil immersion microscope to focus the laser, the author constructed a compact optical tweezers setup and empirically developed a novel method for quantifying forces exerted by low-power optical tweezers: the Trapping Immediacy Model (TIM). TIM is a significant improvement on other methods because it utilizes trapping theory to eliminate error resulting from measurement, inaccuracies due to particle-light interactions, and complex electronics. Most importantly, TIM considers both trap strength and consistency, crucial for accurate modeling of forces exerted by low-power optical tweezers. <br><br> The author changed the cross-sectional profile of the laser to test TIM’s ability to quantify trap forces by simulating infinity correction of the microscope objective. Multiple methods of trap quantification, including TIM, demonstrated that trap forces on polystyrene spheres and yeast cells did increase (60-75%) upon infinity correction. These observations support the author’s novel TIM as an effective and comprehensive trap quantifier.

ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION BY BENTHIC MICROORGANISMS IN FRESHWATER SEDIMENT
Monica Mary Summe
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY, USA

A microbial battery involving marine sediment was discovered by Reimers and colleagues in 2001. Benthic infauna within freshwater sediment were hypothesized to also have the capability to generate electricity. Freshwater Winogradsky columns studied in 2002-2003 generated voltages of around 0.8 V, and yielded fleeting currents ranging from 1 to 150 µA. This freshwater system is further studied in investigations concerning voltage development during column maturation, internal resistances, power and energy outputs, current and power densities, and the effect of various negative electrode sizes.<br><br> Columns were set up in two-liter bottles or chromatography tubes with electrodes imbedded at the bottom of the mud layer, at the water-sediment interface, and the overlying aerobic water. Areas of bottom electrodes were varied by threading carbon rods through carbon mesh.<br><br> Potential differences started low, increased rapidly, and then leveled off as columns matured. Larger electrode areas yielded larger potential differences. Internal resistances of 2-L Winogradsky columns ranged from 688 to 2000 ohms, where the smaller values were obtained in younger columns. Internal resistances were generally smaller with increased electrode area. Current densities between 1.84 and 5.4 mA/m2 were smaller than those reported for marine sediments (65 mA/m2). Power densities ranged from 0.558 to 0.738 mW/m2. The electrons per second transferred to the carbon electrode ranged from 0.14 to 0.32 nmol/s. Investigations that include taking the 16S gene sequences of the organisms surrounding the electrodes will help determine the identities of the benthic infauna responsible for voltage generation.

SURFACE TENSION DISRUPTOR-PHASE 2: USING ELECTROMAGNETS AND A SUPERCONDUCTOR TO AFFECT WATER'S SURFACE TENSION
Alina Rae Muellerleile
Coon Rapids High School Coon Rapids Minnesota, USA

Taking a drop of water out into space and letting it settle into a sphere is an example of surface tension isn't it? Or is it? If you observe molten rock in space, which creates planetoid bodies, it supposedly settles into a sphere because of increasing gravity. But then how would you classify a planet-sized body of water? The same material, in the same environment, producing the same effect, should be caused by the same force. This is the exact thought that brought me to my experiment involving the use of electromagnets and a superconductor to affect water's surface tension. <br><br>Assuming the two forces are related, and then tying in NASA's experiment using electromagnets to affect gravity. I should be able to affect surface tension with an electromagnetic field.<br><br>My procedure for doing this was to place six coils around a superconductor and then suspend a vortex of water in the center of the ring. The superconductor deflected all downward movement of the fields from the coils, up to where the water was. I ran the coils with a Basic Stamp program. I hoped to see some movement in the water indicating to me that the surface tension is being affected. I looked for confirmation of this movement from the video of the experiment. My visual results were inconclusive, however I did receive confirmation that the superconductor was amplifying the field when I placed a magnet in the middle of the field and it was violently thrown out. I have very high hopes for this experiment. The applications of technology like this are only limited by the imagination.<br><br>

A NOVEL GROWTH METHOD FOR SILICON OXIDE NANOWIRES
Michael Edward Coulter
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Much research has been done in recent years on the synthesis and applications of one-dimensional nanostructures. The purpose of this project was to create silicon oxide nanowires with a very simple growth method. The nanowires were made by heating plain silicon substrates under a hydrogen and argon atmosphere. This method is unique because it requires no catalyst, a relatively low growth temperature and a short growth time. Three different nanowire morphologies were observed. These wires were found to be approximately 50 nanometers in diameter and were up to tens of microns long. It was also observed that the crystal orientation of the silicon substrates influenced the nanowire growth pattern. The results suggest that hydrogen etching of the silicon surface begins the nanowire growth process. In the future these wires could be used in scanning near-field optical microscopes and other optoelectronic devices.

BULLET TRAJECTERY
Daniel Robert Bragg
Metcalfe County High School Edmonton , Kentucky. United States 

Abstract<br><br>To demonstrate bullet Trajectory I used six different bullets in my experiment: 12 gauge, 20gauge, 12 gauge slug, 38 caliber, and a 30 - 30 rifle. I used simple equations: Force = Mass x Acceleration, Momentum = Velocity x Mass, and Work = Force x Distance: to show the simple physics of these bullets<br><br> I used a Styrofoam ball to show that bullets with a higher momentum will do more damage on an object than will lower momentum bullets. The shotgun slug had the highest momentum and did the most damage to the ball.<br><br> I shot a paper target with all the guns. This was to show guns with higher velocities are more accurate. My hypothesis proved, the 30 -30 had the highest velocity and was closest to the center of the target. I shot a potato with every gun. The multiple projectiles in a shotgun shells caused the most damage, but all shotguns had the highest force and momentum. <br><br> The last object I shot was a .05 Kg block of wood. I wanted to show the work of the bullets. My goal was to show that force and momentum go hand in hand with work. The 12 gauge shotgun did the most work on the block. However the 20 gauge and the 12 gauge slug were very close. Hopefully This experiment will help people realize the role physics play in our everyday<br><br>life.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SPACIAL FRICTION ON FALLING SPHERES II
Steven Edward Buchholz
Sacred Heart High School, Kingston MA, United States

This experiment explored the effect of varying pressures and its related spacial friction on a free-falling sphere through gas. It was hypothesized that changes in pressure and the resultant adjustment of density would alter the velocity of the sphere. <br><br>A drop chamber was created using an acrylic tube, PVC connectors and valves. After sealing all joints and researching materials used, the apparatus was rated to approx. 5.5 atm. A vacuum pump was used to achieve close to 0 atm and a compressor to obtain pressures of up to 5 atm. A timing circuit consisting of a electronic clock, fiber optic cables, optical sensors, relay, and power supply were designed to measure the time of the sphere’s drop through 1.5 m to an accuracy of 1/1000 sec. Ball valves were used to hold the pressure and as a release mechanism for the drop of the sphere. The sphere was dropped in the same way through each pressure ten times. Pressures of 0.1 atm to 5 atm were used with 1 atm increments. <br><br>By measuring the time it took to drop at each pressure, it was shown that the greater the pressure the longer it took for the sphere to drop through the 1.5m. This proved the hypothesis. The data was then converted to show the loss of energy due to spacial friction of the gas interacting with the sphere. This experiment could be used when considering the effect of spacial friction on bullet trains traveling through an evacuated tunnel.<br><br>

ACOUSTICAL ENVIRONMENT PHYSICAL BOUNDARY EFFECTS ON SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY
Mitchell Keith McCowan
East Central High School Hurley, MS USA

This project in its present state is to prove how physical boundary sound reflections along with absorption materials can enhance or adversely effect speech intelligibility in a given room.<br><br> Procedures incorporated a computer measurement program, measurement microphone, and pink noise generated from test CD into speaker system with test microphone recording impulse response of room in location where audible echoes were heard. Recorded impulse response A without absorption and impulse response B recorded with absorption placed to either side of microphone. Response A was placed into Acoustical analyzer for analysis of percent Alcon score, reverberation time, direct to reverberant sound level, and speech transmission index.<br><br> Impulse response A shows sound reflections at 40-100ms in time, with 4 strong reflections within 10dB of direct sound. Impulse response B shows that reflections were reduced by 20-25dB and isolated as coming from parallel side walls.

Further testing is needed to explore all parameters that effect speech intelligibility. <br><br><br><br><br>

BLOODSTAIN PATTERN ANALYSIS: A FORENSIC INVESTIGATION
Seth Peter Robinson
Leicester High School, Leicester, MA 01524, USA

This forensic investigation was designed to determine the height from which, and the angle at which, a gravity-accelerated blood drop has fallen, through consideration of the geometric characteristics of the resultant bloodstains. Simulated blood was used as a human blood substitute.<br><br> An apparatus was constructed to systematically test the independent variables of height of fall (which was varied by increments of 15 cm, from 15 to 150 cm), and angle of impact (which was varied by increments of 10º, from 90º horizontal to 10º). Control set-ups attempted to minimize all extraneous variables.<br><br> Analysis of data indicated that definite correlations exist between the geometric characteristics of bloodstains (the dependent variable) and the independent variables of height of fall and angle of impact. As the height of fall increased, the diameter of the resultant bloodstains increased proportionally. As the acuteness of the angle of impact decreased, the value of the ratio of the width to length measures of the elongated bloodstain increased. This ratio, in turn, can be expressed as an arc/inverse sine function of the impact angle. Qualitative data also demonstrated that various surface textures yield bloodstains with variable physical characteristics; these findings indicated that surface texture consideration is an integral aspect of bloodstain pattern analysis.<br><br> Experimental results were consistent with the existing literature and fulfilled research objectives. Valid, established methods were used to gather data, which can be practically applied – and the study further extended – to determine the area of origin of blood drops when reconstructing a crime scene. <br><br>

THE AXIAL EFFECT OF CONES ON THE INTENSITY OF SOUND AN EXTENDED ESSAY IN PHYSICS
Rune Gjoringbo Haugseng
St. Olav vgs., Stavanger, Norway

The objective of my investigation was to find how the intensity of sound is affected by passing through a hollow cone along its axis. The intensity of a sound wave is related to the sensation of loudness, and is defined as the energy transported by the wave per unit time across unit area; cone-like shapes are often used to increase the intensity of sound, for instance in the form of megaphones. <br><br> More specifically, I looked at how the intensity is affected by the distance from the sound source, the angle of the cone and the frequency of the sound, as well as how the intensity of sound passing through a cone compares with that of sound moving only through open space. <br><br> I measured the intensity versus the distance from the sound source for three cones with different angles, and without a cone, and the intensity versus the frequency at a constant height outside one of the cones. When analyzing this data, I found that none of the theoretical models I had found fit my data, and I therefore had to find empirical models based on my measurements. For the measurements taken without a cone and outside the cones, the intensity I seemed to vary with the distance r according to the formula I = a/(r+b)^2, where a and b are constant with regard to r, while for the measurements taken inside the cones the best model I could find was <br><br>I = (a+b*sin(c(r+e))+c*cos(c(r+e))/(r+e)^2, where a, b, c, d and e are constant with regard to r. I was unable to conclude anything about the dependence of the intensity on frequency and angle, except that the intensity appears to decrease for increasing angles. It was also evident that the intensity of sound is significantly increased by passing through a cone.

A STUDY ON THE MPEMBA EFFECT
Jacob Lee Stricherz
South Shore High School, South Shore South Dakota, United States

Abstract:<br><br>This experiment tests the Mpemba effect on water and hydrogen peroxide. I hypothesize the Mpemba effect will work in the water, but will not work using hydrogen peroxide.<br><br> I used TI-83 Plus graphing calculators with CBL 2 and Vernier software temperature probes. The warm water was placed in an incubator for 6 hours at 35 degrees Celsius. The cold water was placed in a refrigerator for 6 hours at 5 degrees Celsius. Both containers were left undisturbed and carefully transported to the freezer. The freezer was set at –30 degrees Celsius and the temperature was graphed on the calculators every minute until both containers were found to be completely frozen.<br><br> My conclusion supports my hypothesis in that the Mpemba effect did not work using hydrogen peroxide and it did work using water under the same circumstances. This shows that the convection in water is a major factor in the Mpemba effect. Another contributing factor is the molecular structure of the water compared to the hydrogen peroxide. The amount of dissolved gases hydrogen peroxide can hold may also be a factor.<br><br> Also I found that there was not enough evaporation while the freezer was closed tightly shut. The Mpemba effect only occurred when the freezer lid was left ajar 3 cm throughout the test, thus evaporation is a very important factor in achieving the Mpemba effect.<br><br>This experiment has created new questions for me to ask and new aspects to study the Mpemba effect.<br><br>

HEAT CONTENT FOR HARDWOODS: IS IT LINKED TO DENSITY?
Nathan Gale Dailey 
Parkersburg High School, Parkersburg, WV, United States of America

This investigation was limited to two main properties of individual hardwood species: the strait grain dry density and the average total heat content expressed in terms of total energy per unit volume. This investigation’s purpose upon determining these values was to first, determine the graphical correlation among the data, and secondly, to determine whether this graphical representation of data could be used to accurately predict either the total heat content or the dry density given the other value (to determine whether additional data would fit the graphical correlation established). From analyzing the data obtained through multiple testings of hardwoods of widely varying densities, a best fit linear model for density and heat content was created. Data was obtained for additional wood species and the data was plotted, paying special attention to the degree of variance from the linear model. From the results of this investigation I drew the conclusion that, as a general rule, the greater the dry density of a hardwood species the greater the total heat content for that species will be, although, as was evidenced by certain hardwood data values, more specific components of density may play additional roles in total heat content. By plotting additional values on the established linear model, I was able to conclude that, for the most part, either the density or the total heat content of a hardwood can be used to accurately predict its partner’s value within the greatest original percent variance of the woods used to determine the linear model.

INSULATION CAPABILITIES OF EMERGENCY BLANKETS
Oliver Ralf Gothe
Dutch Fork High School, Irmo SC, United States

Insulation is one of the most common elements in modern houses. However, the insulation that is applied in buildings might still be improved. Emergency blankets have been used for some time now to insulate a person that had an accident. These blankets prevent the victim from overheating or from critical heat loss. Combining the old conductive insulation (fiberglass insulation) with this reflective insulation should yield a more powerful insulation for modern houses. In this project this improvement of the insulation capability is being researched by building models and then conducting experiments with these models. These experiments will measure the potential to keep heat energy in or out, depending on whether it is cold or hot outside. Succeeding in producing a better insulation will help reduce energy usage due to regulation of inside temperature in living areas and thereby help prevent an energy crisis.

AN EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE CORRECTION FACTOR IN RAYLEIGH'S CRITERION
Erica Sarie Janoff
Leigh High School, San Jose, Ca, United States

Although many experiments have been conducted to investigate<br><br>Rayleigh's criterion, many variations have used only light waves. I was interested to see if this was still true if I used water waves, and if true, was there a constant involved with water similar to the constant of 1.22 pertaining to light waves. <br><br>Water waves were generated in a ripple tank. An electric motor was then attached to one end of the tank, with two knobs attached to that. The knobs just barely touched the surface of the water, so that once the motor was turned on, the knobs could create duplicate circular wave patterns. I then placed two blocks of paraffin wax into the water, exactly twenty-five centimeters from the epicenters of each of the waves (L). The distance between the two blocks (D) was determined by the independent variables: the distance between the two epicenters (d) and the wavelengths produced by the motor (ë ). I moved the blocks either towards each other or away, until I saw that the wave pattern that had passed through represented only a single wave front (ie. that without nodes). I tested four different distances between epicenters, and four different wavelengths, which totaled six different trials.<br><br> To find the correction factor I used the formula that is used as Rayleigh’s criterion, for light waves è=1.22 (ë/d). However, because I used water waves instead, I needed to find a new number, n, that would represent 1.22. By substituting the numbers from each of the trials, I was able to get an approximate value of .45, which represents the new constant for Rayleigh’s criterion when applied to water waves.<br><br>

LIQUID TENSILITY AND BEESNEST CONSTRUCTED OBSERVATION BEESNEST BUILDING
Ling Zhang
Xinzhou No.1 Middle School Xinzhou, Shanxi, CHINA

This project talks about how the beesnests shape into hexagonal configuration.<br><br> It is believed that bees are expert architects in the building of their hexagonal nests. <br><br> On the basis of obserbvation and research,I find that bees first make individual round holes instead of the hexagonal ones, then stick them together, and then shape into the hexagonal ones. Why is it?<br><br> Through observing the soap bubble blowing, I also notice piles of hexagonal soap bubbles. Then, I associate it with the hexagonal beesnests. By doing the soap bubble blowing experiments, it turns out that a certain kind of natural force makes the soap bubbles shape into the hexagonal. The beesnest-wetting-and-separating experiments also prove that the individual round holes naturally shape into the hexagonal ones. Thus,the conclusion is as follows:<br><br> (1) A bee has a gift for making the round holes, but it is the <br><br> tensility of liquid that makes the round holes shape into the <br><br> hexagonal configuration.<br><br> (2) Beesnest does not save building material.<br><br>

DIRECTED TARGET ABLATION FOR BEAMED ENERGY PROPULSION
Benjamin Arthur Rosenberg
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head Island SC, USA

Beamed Energy Propulsion (BEP) is the use of a powerful laser beam to ablate metal, turn it into plasma, and create thrust. Three phases of research occurred during this project, all designed to increase the efficiency of the BEP reaction.<br><br> The primary phase of experimentation tested a unique improvement – a shaped metal target cavity – thereby directing the plasma and ablated material in a more perpendicular path than the previous hemispheric pattern created by a flat metal target. This greatly increased the efficiency of the targets, especially when they were covered with an additional liquid for additional mass.<br><br> The second phase of experimentation tested target materials for efficiency (defined as kinetic energy converted / laser energy introduced). Aluminum, brass, and copper were tested as dry targets, and in combination with water and vacuum oil as additives on the surface of the target. Aluminum was the most efficient metal, followed by brass, and finally copper. Water was the most efficient liquid, followed by vacuum oil, and both were far more efficient than dry targets.<br><br> The third phase introduced several new target designs which refilled themselves with a liquid, making them suitable for consecutive laser shots. These three designs were evaluated, and the most promising was built and tested. The target worked efficiently with repeated shots from the laser.<br><br>

POLYCRYSTALLINE LASER MEDIA
Adolph Brian Mullen
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head, SC, USA

Historically, Nd:YAG has been the media of choice for solid-state lasers. Shortly after the invention of the laser, scientists realized, polycrystalline or ceramic YAG offered significant material advantages over single crystal YAG. However, early efforts were plagued with high scattering losses and solarization. Recently, the scattering issues were solved using advanced vacuum sintering techniques; however, solarization continues to be an issue. <br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to determine if a high-purity polycrystalline media will have increased solarization resistance and thus be a viable replacement for single crystal laser media.<br><br> Samples of single and polycrystalline Nd:YAG as well as Nd:phosphate glass were tested for scattering losses with a novel apparatus comprised of a CCD camera and several visible laser sources. It was determined that the polycrystalline Nd:YAG rod, obtained from Konoshima, did exhibit negligible scattering losses. The polycrystalline Nd:YAG rod was then tested in a laser resonator for relative efficiency and solarization resistance. Under flashlamp excitation, the lasing performance of the polycrystalline rod was nearly identical to the single crystal laser rod. Under high excitation energy, the polycrystalline laser rod did solarize. An interesting observation was that some of the color center formations recovered over a period of several days at room temperature. The manufacturer and other researchers have not reported and were unaware of this phenomenon. <br><br> Since polycrystalline Nd:YAG exhibited solarization only under high fluence, it may be concluded, polycrystalline Nd:YAG is a viable replacement for single crystal Nd:YAG in some applications. <br><br>

A STUDY OF TUNNELING BETWEEN DISSIMILAR METALS
Ryan Bradley Comes
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

In electrical contacts there is an inherent resistance when electrical current travels between two dissimilar metals. This is due to the contact potential difference where electrons experience a different potential energy level in each metal. The goal of this project was to improve conductivity between dissimilar metals using quantum mechanical principles. The surprising results of this research provide a new theoretical model supported by experimental evidence for the improvement of electron transport between dissimilar metals. Applications are numerous and include improved computer chip operation and improved performance of nearly all electrical devices.<br><br>Different surface treatments were used to study the behavior of electron conductivity in electrical contacts. A scanning tunneling microscope was used to produce tunneling between a platinum tip of the microscope and various metal samples. Data collected compared current versus voltage (I-V) graphs for treated and untreated contacts. The I-V data was analyzed using mathematical solutions of Schrodinger’s Equation for quantum tunneling. In a surprising result, increases in the potential energy barrier for the gap were correlated with improved electron transport between the metals. In other words, raising the potential energy barrier in a contact improves the overall conductivity.<br><br>Calculations presented show that the transmission probability for electron tunneling is actually higher than that of conducting electrons due to the contact potential barrier. By increasing the potential barrier between the metals, the number of electrons conducting is reduced and, if the barrier is very thin, then the number of higher energy electrons used for tunneling increases.<br><br>

EFFECT OF METHANOL/ETHANOL RATIOS AND CIRCUIT LOAD ON FUEL CELL PERFORMANCE
Mitcham Hudson Costley
Rockdale Magnet School, Conyers, GA, USA

The purpose of this research was to determine how concentrations of methanol and ethanol fuel and resistance load on a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell affected its power output. The research hypotheses were that if different mixtures of methanol and ethanol were used as fuel in the fuel cell, then the solution with the highest concentration of methanol would provide the greatest power output, and that if a variable resistance load was powered by current from the fuel cell, then there would be a point where the fuel cell was producing the maximum power output (based on load resistance). Different fuel solutions for use in the fuel cell were mixed: 3% methanol (control), 2% methanol/ 1% ethanol, 1% methanol/ 2% ethanol, and 3% ethanol. For each fuel solution, the voltage and current at different levels of resistance (0, 1, 3.3, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 220 Ù) were measured. Power was then calculated from these measurements. A t-test was conducted comparing each ethanol-containing fuel with the control fuel at each resistance level on the basis of power output. It was determined that ethanol-containing solutions exhibited significantly less power output than the control solution for low load resistances (0 to 50 Ù) but produced approximately the same amount of power for high load resistances (100 and 220 Ù); also, a maximum power point did not exist in the 3% methanol or 2% methanol/ 1% ethanol solutions, but it did exist in the 1% methanol/ 2% ethanol and 3% ethanol solutions.

CHARACTERIZATION OF SQUID SUSCEPTOMETER
Yunjie Ma
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village Colorado, USA

I have measured the energy sensitivity of a set of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) susceptometers manufactured by optical lithography on silicon wafer chips and used them to analyze the Barkhausen Noise of two magnetic shields. My project was conducted at the University of Colorado at Denver Low-Temperature Superconducting Laboratory. In my project, I would induce a magnetization of a sample by applying a small current through the field coil of the susceptometer. The resulting signal is amplified and then sent to and read at room temperature and recorded. It was found that the devices had a minimum sensitivity of 63 Planck Bars. The best susceptometer measured was the Low Resistance Type A Gradiometer. Using the susceptometers, I then analyzed the Barkhausen Noise, a type of magnetic noise that occurs in all materials when one applies a magnetic field induced by an AC voltage, of two magnetic shielding materials: Metglas 2605SA1 and Mumetal. I found that Mumetal was much quieter than Metglas.

THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE ELECTRIC RESPONSE OF A HIGH-VELOCITY, AIR-SUSPENDED PIEZOELECTRIC CRYSTAL POWDER IN A MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
Ryan Paul Jones, Eric Anthony Smith
Astronaut High School, Titusville, FL, United States of America

This project explores the possibility of developing an ambient temperature plasma with characteristics that will enable a magnetohydrodynamic process generator to extract electrical power. This unique approach involves a piezoelectric crystal powder (KNaC4H4O6) suspended in a high velocity air stream, seeded with static energy from a homemade Wimshurst electrostatic generator.<br><br> Prior to construction, the researchers’ past MHD projects were reviewed and new concepts theorized. The researchers’ project intends to offer a solution to traditional MHD generator electrode erosion problems.<br><br> Two complete test units were constructed, with the first unit modular in design, constructed of clear polycarbonate sheet, but not fully functional due to slow seed material injection problems. The second unit uses PVC pipe, some of the original modules, and most of the original design concepts. The concept requires a high-energy source to cause ionization of the entrained powder. Research suggested a Wimshurst electrostatic generator would provide sufficient high voltage energy, so it was fabricated and integrated into the test unit.<br><br> Initial tests with the KNaC4H4O6 were encouraging until the material’s melting point was reached, fouling the fan. The unit was disassembled, cleaned, repaired, and further tests were accomplished using NaCl and KCl.<br><br> Results of both voltage and amperage tests of NaCl were compared to that of clear air alone using ANOVA statistical analysis and it is clearly evident that plasma ionization is occurring due to the high power output. This unique approach shows that low temperature plasma can be used in a MHD environment to generate electrical power.<br><br>

THE 2P-3D ELECTRON TRANSITION MULTIPLET OF AR+13: A STELLAR DENSITY DIAGNOSTIC
Laura Anne Heeter, Kristina Lynn Naranjo-Rivera
Breck School, Minneapolis MN, USA

The 2p-3d electron transition multiplet of Ar+13 was tested as a density diagnostic for stellar objects and plasma. Theoretical photon emission models show a correlation between beam current density and electron transitions from the ground state 2p(spin 1/2) and metastable state 2p(spin 3/2) of Ar+13 to the 3d levels. Using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), peak intensities of Ar+13 were tested for sensitivity to beam current density. The first goal of this project was to test increased electron excitation to the metastable state as beam current was increased. The second goal was to determine the relationship between beam current and intensity ratios of Ar+13 spectral peaks. Argon was ionized to Ar+13, and Ar+13 photon emission spectra were collected. N+5 was used to calibrate the data. Intensity ratios were calculated for peaks of the 2p-3d multiplet. The results showed an inverse relationship between beam current and the intensity ratios. At low beam current densities, experimental intensity ratios were within 10% of theoretical predictions. At higher beam current densities, the experimental data show a 10-20% lower intensity ratio than predicted. Since the discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental data were minimal, the results obtained with EBIT should be applicable to natural stellar thermal plasmas. The findings of this experiment suggest Ar+13 is a practical density diagnostic. Further experiments may repeat this method with other elements to provide a broader range of density diagnostics.

DETERMINING BOLTZMANN'S CONSTANT THROUGH ANALYSIS OF BROWNIAN MOTION
Samuel James Asarnow, William Tucker Page
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Boltzmann's constant is a fundamental constant that connects the kinetic molecular theory of ideal gases with the laws of thermodynamics. This project sought to calculate experimentally a value for Boltzmann’s constant through measurements of Brownian motion, the random motion of microscopic colloids in suspension caused by collisions with molecules of the suspending liquid. In this experiment, latex microspheres were suspended in water and viewed under a high powered microscope. Digital video of their Brownian motion was collected and video analysis software was used to measure their average physical displacement in a defined time interval. The theoretically derived equation describing Brownian motion in terms of Boltzmann’s constant was applied to the data, and a value of 1.45x10^-23 J/K was determined for Boltzmann’s constant. This value differs from the accepted value of 1.38x10^-23 J/K by only 4.64%, well within the allowable limit for a project of this magnitude and nature. Because of this accuracy, and the relative simplicity of the experiment, the procedure used will be condensed into a lab protocol for advanced high school physics classes.

THE PHOTON DISTRIBUTION STATISTICS OF HIGH AND LOW-GAIN LASERS OPERATING AT THRESHOLD IMPROVING THE PROCESS OF QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
Huy Tuan Le, Stephen Austin Age
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

Quantum cryptography, though still in its infancy, is troubled by several problems. One of which is the need for an inexpensive reliable single-photon light source. Although machines might have been built, this team believes that timing is the key toward statistical reliability. By using a Helium-Neon (He-Ne) laser and a Semiconductor Light Emitting Diode (LED) laser to study the photon distributions at or barely above threshold, it was hoped that a form of multi-atom, single-photon laser could be found. When photon counting was performed for the He-Ne laser at 60V, 80V, 82V, 90V, and 100V, it was found that there were strong Poissonian characteristics. It was also found that the distribution became more random with higher input power. Similar results were obtained for the LED laser at 1.90V, 1.91V, and 2,00V, as well. These data rejected the hypothesis that the distribution becomes less Poissonian closer to the operating threshold. It seemed to suggest that at a voltage between the maximum and the threshold, the distribution is mostly non-Poissonian. Additionally, it appeared that with the LED laser, higher operating power results in a higher mean emission of photons. This trend was not evident for the He-Ne lasers. Thus, the data were inconclusive for the second hypothesis that the number of photons emitted is proportional to the quantity of lasing materials not the amount of lasing power. Using these statistics, a mathematical model and computerized simulation of this data is to be formed and further studies are already on the drawing board.

ELECTROGRAVITY PROPULSION: THE ION WIND ARGUMENT
Audrey Morris, Faye Rook
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, & Arts, Hot Springs, AR, U.S.

The purpose of this experimentation was to create a basic asymmetrical capacitor, commonly called a lifter, powered by electrogravity propulsion and to determine whether ion wind is the only force behind the propulsion effect. It was hypothesized that electrogravity propulsion will successfully be demonstrated and it will be ascertained that the force produced by ion wind is not of great enough magnitude to be the only force involved and would therefore present an indication of other propulsion systems at work.<br><br> A high voltage power supply, able to generate up to 25-30 kV DC output from a 12-24 V DC input, was constructed to power the lifters. A basic lifter was constructed of balsa wood, aluminum foil, and thin copper wire. Using a Pasco strain gauge, the average thrust for the lifter was found. A pine straw smoker was used to pump smoke onto the lifter and the smoke flow on each side of the lifter was measured. A wind meter was used to get the actual measurement of the wind velocity.<br><br> The theoretical wind velocity needed to propel the lifter by purely ion wind was determined on an analytical basis. The minimum wind velocity required to propel the lifter was then experimentally determined. The comparison of the theoretical wind velocity with the experimentally measured wind velocity indicated that the hypothesis was supported and the force produced by ion wind alone is insufficient to propel a lifter.

When we rub the rim of a wineglass, a definite tone can be heard. One calls it a singing wineglass. This tone changes when we pour liquid into the glass. Air bubbles present in the liquid also alter the pitch we hear. We measured and analyzed these frequency shifts using piezoelectric crystal loudspeakers connected to both an oscilloscope and an analyzing computer.<br><br> Our experiments revealed some unexpected and sometimes counter intuitive results. Specifically, our findings include: <br><br>(1)Only a layer of fluid adjacent to the wall can affect the pitch one hears.<br><br>(2)The thickness of the layer is basically the same whether the fluid is contained in the glass or the glass is immersed in a fluid.<br><br>(3)We have developed a simple theoretical picture to describe the physics involved. We have also performed extensive experimental checks to verify this idea.<br><br>

NANOCONDUCTANCE: THE QUANTIZATION OF CONDUCTANCE IN METALLIC WIRES
Si Yue Guo, Raphael Gervais
College Regina Assumpta and Ecole Pierre-Laporte, Montreal, Quebec, Canada

A profound understanding of the behavior of materials at the nanoscale, more specifically conductance, will greatly benefit scientists essentially in communication and information processing technologies. Our project consists of designing and building a novel technique to measure conductance quantization in metallic nanowires (gold (Au), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu)). Creation of nanowires was possible using a simple and cost effective mechanical break junction on a plastic slide. Furthermore, aiming for precision, practicality, and efficiency, the system was automated to allow an objective gathering of conductance measurements. The collection of a great amount of data permits a statistical analysis of the results. The advantage of our system is the accessibility of the materials and the quick setup. This innovative aspect allows an observation of the quantum effects similar to those obtained in research done using an STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope). The histogram of the frequency of conductance values reveals three convincing peaks for Au and Ag, and a series of inconsistent peaks for Cu. The peaks correspond to the multiples of the theoretical quantization of electrical conductance, G0 (G0=1/12.9kOhms). The main explanation is the coinciding of the Fermi wavelength (highest wavelength of the electron at 0 Kelvin) to the diameter of one channel of atoms in metals. However, we were able to conclude that in addition to quantum electron transport, structural particularities also influence the results. Experimentation on nickel and tin is currently in progress. Future applications include the miniaturization of transistors in microelectronics.

STILL OUT IN THE COLD? ELUCIDATION OF THE ANOMALOUS GENERATION OF HYDROGEN BY PLASMA ELECTROLYSIS
Morgan Kathryn Habetz, Marissa Leigh Champagne
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, United States

This project replicated a controversial cold fusion experiment to determine whether it represents an energy solution or illusion. The specific purpose of this project was to obtain more energy than is put into a system by the Plasma Electrolysis of an electrolyte resulting in a Coefficient of Performance that is “over-unity.” Test variables included 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 moles of sodium hydrogen carbonate solutions, length of cathode (8, 16, 24 mm ), input voltage, reactor design, starting temperature, weight of water, time of reaction, and water types (distilled and filtered bayou water). Different tests performed included: equipment calibration tests, safety test, and heat loss test. One hundred and thirty-six individual experiments were conducted. The measured Coefficient of Performance of the reactor was above unity 67% of the time. The calculated Coefficient of Performance of the reactor was above unity 80% of the time. It was observed that lowering the starting temperature, increasing the cathode length, and having a higher electrolyte molarity increased the efficiency of the reactor. It was also noted that extremely high power input, electrolyte evaporation, and cathode erosion decreased the reactor’s efficiency. Ten final tests were conducted using identical settings to evaluate reactor’s capability to produce a consistent COP over unity.

SIMULATING THE PROPERTIES OF A MIRAGE
Bailey Alan Stewart, Lauren Rose Richey
Springville Junior High, Springville, Utah, United States of America

This experiment tests how different temperatures of air affect bending of light and also attempts to create a mirage in a labratory setting. We used two methods to accomplish this.<br><br> The first method consisted of an oven-like box placed outside in the cold winter air. With the angle of incidence set and the box placed parallel to the wall, we heated the container and watched the laser beam refract along the wall. By using trigonometric ratios, we calculated the angles of refraction and the indices of refraction in each temperature. <br><br> We later realized that a temperature gradient was present within the container during the first method. Because of this, we decided to conduct another experiment, in which the temperature gradient was controlled and analyzed.<br><br> Our second method consisted of suspending a pan full of ice water over a hotplate to create a controlled temperature gradient. By varying the height of the hotplate and pan, the mounted laser passed though different temperatures of air. The beam was shone down a large corridor, and the deflection was measured on a screen. An equation to predict the movement was derived, which allowed us to compare actual to predicted movement.<br><br> We then positioned a camera in place of the laser and took pictures through the temperature gradient. The pictures taken were in fact a mirage. When comparing data, we could see that as the heat increased, the image slowly shifted downward. We have concluded that a mirage can be produced in a laboratory setting. <br><br>

PROGRAMMING A MODEL ROCKET FLIGHT SIMULATOR
Brian D Go, Joshua C Klontz
Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, Bethesda MD 20814, United States

A program was built to simulate the flight of a model rocket. Previous software has been developed for use with real rockets, however the quality of those written for model rockets is often inadequate for practical and more advanced purposes. While both real and model rockets share the same velocity equation, for model rockets orbital mechanics are not needed. The simulator was composed of two parts, one written in C++ to calculate the flight of the rocket, and the other part was written in Visual Basic to allow a useable Graphical User Interface and a method for graphing the results. At the heart of the program is a brute-force integrator that takes into account the effects of engine thrust, gravity loss, and drag loss over time in order to plot graphs of the rockets velocity and altitude over time. To test the program six different rockets of varying sizes and shapes were launched three times each. The altitude for each launch was measured at three different tracking points to ensure accuracy. As opposed to placing controls on rocket specifications, a wide variety of rockets were used, to ensure that the program would remain accurate for all rocket designs. The results of the tests confirmed that the simulator accurately modeled rocket flight for conventional rockets, however it had trouble accurately predicting more eccentric models.

MULTI PIXELLED DISK MPD
Abraham Petrus van Wyk, Michel, Philippe, Mouton
Waterkloof High School, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa

The purpose of the research was to find a feasible method of significantly increasing the data storage capacity of removable optical storage media, without increasing compression ratios. The original concept of reflecting different colours from the same pit should create more data combinations compared to a single colour.<br><br>Initial research into current/future methods of optical data storage was followed by research in laser technology and the properties of light. Academics and engineers from different disciplines confirmed the feasibility of the theoretical design of a colour-coded disk with a multi-head, multi-colour reader/writer. Increasing the data capacity of every pit, from a binary number to an octal value, was investigated. Further study into codes used for storing data led to an affirmative, though theoretical, conclusion; four times more data storage capacity. A further improvement was conceptualised by the simultaneous reading of the two opposing pits, one per side of a double-sided disk. Two independent combinations of octal numbers result in 64 possible combinations (32 times more data). Although the theory is supported, similar applications could not be referenced.<br><br>A further quantum breakthrough will be the addition of UV light. The resultant capacity increase of 128 over current media is highly probable.<br><br>The underlying technology, which relies on creating more data per pit in combination with an opposing pit, is feasible. The breakthrough lies in the effective utilization of light and data codes rather than higher compression ratios.

COLLAPSE OF VAPOR FILM BY ELECTROSTATIC FORCE IN LEIDENFROST PHENOMENON
Yuto Hayamizu, Koki Osaki , Fumihiro Maezawa
Toyama Prefectural Toyama Senior High School, Toyama City Toyama Pref, JAPAN

When a droplet is dropped onto a heated body, a vapor film forms between the droplet and the heated body before the two come into contact. The vapor film prevents the droplet from coming into contact with heated body, This is called the Leidenfrost phenomenon. In the present study, two unique phenomena associated with this phenomenon were discovered: collapse of the vapor film (CVF) and light emission (LE) under the specific conditions of the Leidenfrost phenomenon. CVF occurs when a voltage is applied across the droplet and the heated body (conductor), and LE is observed when the droplets are of an electrolytic solution. The causes of the two phenomena were investigated in this project.<br><br>Progressing from a hypothesis that CVF occurs when the electrostatic force becomes greater than the buoyancy of the vapor film, an experiment was devised to measure the electrostatic force by recreating a condition similar to CVF. This hypothesis is later to be verified by comparison with buoyancy measurements, which are presently in progress.<br><br>For light emission, it was thought that the phenomenon might be similar to a flame reaction. In fact, LE appeared to be unique to each type of liquid. By analysis of the line spectra using a spectrometer, it is shown that for each type of solution there are significant similarities between the LE and the flame reaction line spectra, demonstrating that LE is closely related to a flame reaction. <br><br>

SEEBECK EFFECT: THE THERMOELECTRICAL POTENTIAL OF VARIOUS METAL COUPLES
Craig Toshiro Imazumi, Stephen Hop, Joanna Estrada
Oak Grove High School, San Jose California, United States of America

The Seebeck effect is the generation of an electrical potential when strips of two dissimilar metals are connected to each other, where the two junctions of the metals are at different temperatures. In this experiment, the potential was measured when nickel, tungsten, copper, silver, and Alumel (5% Al, 95% Ni) are paired with Chromel (10% Cr, 90%Ni) and steel at 0 and 100 deg C. It is hypothesized that metals with the largest difference in ionization energy between the metal and Chromel or steel will generate the largest potentials. Because nickel has the lowest ionization energy of the metals we measured, we expect it to generate the largest number of microvolts, and therefore to be the best thermocouple material. The thermocouples were submerged in boiling water and ice water, and the resulting voltage was measured using a voltmeter. (Actually, a Fluke 87 Multimeter and a Fluke 80TK Thermocouple Module was used to read the “temperature” in degrees C, which we converted to voltage.) The results demonstrate that Nickel wire coupled with Chromel generated the largest potential, followed by Alumel, silver, copper, and finally tungsten. In thermoelectrics there is something called a Seebeck Coefficent. The Seebeck Coefficent is the thermoelectric sensitivity of each metal. Ionization energies are directly linked with Seebeck Coefficents. The larger the difference between the Seebeck Coefficients of the paired metals, the higher the voltage. Our results are consistent with what is predicted by Seebeck’s theory.

THE EFFECT OF CENTRIPETAL FORCE ON ARMADILLIDIUM VULGARE
Jason Lavar Anderson, Watson,Clara Grace
Grenada High School, Grenada MS, United States of America

This project is a study of the common terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare. Research has been done to learn about anatomy, physiology, habitats, behavior, and growth rate.<br><br> The purpose of experimentation was to determine the effects of centripetal force on the growth rate of A. vulgare. It is hypothesized that centripetal force will decrease the average live mass and affect fecal droppings. <br><br> A. vulgare were collected, two control groups and two experimental groups were established. Average live masses were determined prior to placing the experimental groups on a spinning fan. Masses were taken daily for the next several weeks. Fecal matter was also collected. Mathematical calculations determined the centripetal force exerted.<br><br> Results compared with the control groups indicated that average live mass decreased in all groups, but the experimental groups dereased the most. The experimental groups experienced the most moulting.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS WHEN USED TO MUTE A B-FLAT TRUMPET - MUTE MANIA
Katherine Virginia Bowles, Rachel Campbell
Luray High School, Luray, VA, USA

The question for our project, "Mute Mania", was: Do different materials have an effect on the intonation of the trumpet when used as muting devices? We hypothesized that all the Styrofoam and paper materials would cause the notes to become sharp, the cloth materials would have no effect, and the glass and stoneware materials would make the notes flat. To carry out this project, we first warmed up and tuned the trumpet. The same person played the trumpet throughout the whole experiment. As the person playing the trumpet held a sustained note, the other person held a muting material over the bell of the trumpet. The same person holding the muting material held a tuner in their other hand. As the note was being played, its intonation was recorded and put into our data. We repeated this process with three notes (low C, middle G, and high C) and with every material.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

SELF ORGANIZED CRITICALITY IN THE DYNAMICS OF GRANULAR SYSTEM
Roisin McCloskey, Breandan Mac Chnoic
Lumen Christy College, Derry, IRELAND

Recent advances in our understanding of the ability of multi-component systems apparently to self organise into ordered structures in which characteristic length and time scales disappear, so called Self-Organised Criticality (SOC), may explain the origin of spatial and temporal fractals which are common in nature. They may also represent a first step in explaining the fundamental transition between a chemical soup governed by the laws of physics, to complex self-reproducing molecules governed by the laws of natural selection. <br><br>Here we examine the physics of sand piles as the stereotypical example of systems that produce structure from disorder without tuning. We show that while ideal computer sand pile models give rise to ideal critical point behaviour, more realistic models exhibit enhanced numbers of large events due to the effect of finite system size. We review experimental work on real sand and seed piles and note that their results are littered with examples of exactly this large event enhancement. We design and construct an apparatus in which a seed-pile is continually fed, sometimes for days, with a steady, tunable supply of individual grains. We examine the distribution of events on these piles using a photographic technique, which, we believe for the first time, allows the examination of small events on the surface of the pile. These events exhibit power-law scaling indicative of SOC but their development is punctuated by large catastrophic collapses due to a fundamental change in causative mechanism. A qualitative model is developed for the occurrence of these events.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF NANOSCALE STRUCTURES ON SEMICONDUCTOR: A NOVEL TECHNIQUE IN FABRICATION OF NANOWIRES USING SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPY.
Zihao Richard Zhang
West Shore Jr./Sr. High School, Melbourne, FL, USA

The principles of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) are not limited to imaging nanoscale features of conductive surfaces. Using basic and inexpensive STM technologies, one can hypothesize that nanoscale structures are created on the surface of a device by field evaporation method. This phenomenon of “atomic emissions” is linked to Müller field evaporation process, but little is known about its properties in nanoscale mechanics. Ultimately, harnessing this capability using the STM can lead to practical fabrication of small structures such as quantum dots or nanowires, which cannot be made by optical lithography and electrochemical deposition.<br><br><br> In this experiment, a high voltage pulse is applied to the STM pure Gold (111) wire tip produced by an electrochemical etching method. The Gold tip can obtain high definition scanning images as well as fabricate consistent features of nanostructures. Three types of substrates are used to test this hypothesis: Annealed Gold, Silicon, and Graphite substrates. Nanostructure dimensions and its adhesions and their variations with applied evaporation field potential and time duration are measured. Reproducibility of nanostructures is evaluated through consistent emissions at multiple substrate locations. Finally, using lateral control of substrate location by piezo coordination, nanowires down to widths of <20nm are produced in a desired pattern.<br><br><br> Experimentation and analysis concludes that “atomic emissions” using Müller field evaporation process from the STM tips on substrate are proven to be operative on the nanometer scale. This result opens up the possibility that nanoscale electronics or detectors can be made with STM in ordinary laboratory conditions.<br><br>

SUPER COOL SUPER STRONG, YEAR 2
Catherine Nicole Bewerse
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach Florida, United States

In theory, the Cryogenic treatment of metals permanently changes the structure of the metal, at least until the metal is heat treated or deformed. However, the affect on the characteristics depends on the metal and how it reacts to stress. This inconsistency in the result of cryogenic treatment on different metals has caused much controversy about the theory of cryogenic treatment.<br><br> Do the metals actually change? Samples of Aluminum, Copper, Iron, Zinc, Brass, and Steel were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope for changes in the granular boundaries. The metals were examined before and after being cryogenically treated with liquid nitrogen. The samples were also prepared and then Nanoindented at two different depths to gauge their hardness pre- and post-treatment. Samples were examined with a Transmission Electron Microscope to further examine grains and artifacts such as dislocations and twins. Samples were further analyzed with Differential Scanning Calorimetry to search for phase transformations.<br><br> After treatment the granular boundaries did not change. The hardness values at the deeper depth were found to be more accurate in statistical examination. Copper decreased in hardness, Aluminum, Zinc, and Brass increased, and Iron and Steel were inconclusive. When the strengthened metals were cryogenically frozen, the grains individually contracted, creating stresses. These stresses induced work hardening , creating dislocations which increase strength and brittleness. In Copper, the stresses initiated work softening, which relieved the stresses through slip. This reorganizes the metal, which showed as a decrease in strength.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF ATTRACTIVE FORCES ON MULTI-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY
Shannen Alexei Adcock
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock Arkansas, United States of America

In recent years, nanotechnology has flourished. It has become a source of newer, faster electronic devices and has opened the computer industry’s ever-increasing scope of possibilities. To study nanotubes, the cornerstone of nanotechnology, a powerful microscope must be used; however, the physical characteristics of nanotubes change at this level. Van der Waals forces begin to affect the nanoscopic structures.<br><br> The research objective of this experiment was to determine if multi-walled carbon nanotubes have a circular cross-section when deposited onto an atomically flat surface. It is expected that the nanotubes flatten under the effects of van der Waals forces. To test this, nanotubes were synthesized at UALR, stored in ethanol, and pipetted onto clean mica slides. The slides were heated until the ethanol had evaporated, then placed in the loading tray of the Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope. Several slides were scanned and sections of them were analyzed.<br><br> Through numerous scans, it was determined that multi-walled carbon nanotubes are, in fact, deformed. It was found on average that the horizontal distance the nanotube spans is far greater than the vertical distance. While standing alone, the nanotubes are very round and symmetrical. While under the effects of surface van der Waals forces, however, they lose their symmetry. The hypothesis failed to be rejected.<br><br>

DIAMAGNETIC LEVITATION
Jacob Andrew McGregor
James A. Bowie High School, Austin, TX, USA

<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to test if the levitated height of a magnet becomes greater or lower with respect to a material's magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic susceptibility of materials was tested by stably levitating a magnet and finding the maximum levitated height for each material.<br><br> Three diamagnetic materials with published magnetic susceptibilities, Lead, Bismuth, and Pyrolytic graphite, were tested to find which of the three would stably levitate a magnet the highest. The published values of dimensionless magnetic susceptibilities range from -23x10-6 (Lead) to -450x10-6 (Pyrolytic graphite).<br><br> There is a positive correlation between the negative magnetic susceptibility of the material and the levitated height of the floater magnet. Pyrolytic graphite has a value of -450x10-6, the lowest magnetic susceptibility value of the three diamagnetic materials tested, and levitated the magnet the highest (approximately 1.55 mm). <br><br> The experiment was repeated with three different size and strength floater magnets to confirm that the relationship between the material's magnetic susceptibility and maximum levitated height was a reproducible positive correlation.<br><br> This project confirmed that as the diamagnetic material's value of magnetic susceptibility becomes lower, the possible levitation height becomes higher. It also confirmed that the documented susceptibility values of the three materials are true with respect to repulsion strengths.<br><br> Little energy is needed to rapidly spin a levitated magnet. Combining a spinning magnet with a coil of wire in a vacuum will generate clean energy.

A VIBROACOUSTICAL STUDY COMPARING THE OUT-OF-PLANE MOTION OF VIOLIN BRIDGES UNDER DIFFERENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS USING HOLOGRAPHIC INFEROMETRY
Emily Rae Drabek
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN, USA

Holographic Inferometry is a method using the interference of two lasers to represent the vibrational patterns, or modes, of a structure and was used to determine the out-of-plane vibrational patterns of a standard violin bridge, an ebony-embedded violin bridge, and an E string ebony violin bridge while on and off of the violin. It was hypothesized that order of vibrational frequencies from lowest to highest would be the ebony-embedded bridge, the E string ebony bridge, and the standard violin bridge. A neodymium-YAG laser was used to create two holograms of the bridge’s periodic motion. Each hologram was of the bridge in its extreme position of motion, or where it did not vibrate. When these two holograms were combined, an interference occurred that allowed the vibrational patterns to be observed. When the bridges were clamped, the ebony-embedded bridge had the lowest vibrational frequency for mode one, and the E string ebony bridge had the lowest frequency for mode two. This was due to the shape of the mode in relation to the location of the ebony. When the bridges were on the violin, two modes were also observed. The mode shapes of the E string ebony bridge and the standard bridge were the most similar. Vibrational frequencies from lowest to highest were the E string ebony bridge, the ebony-embedded bridge, and the standard bridge. Because of the standard bridge’s ability to transfer higher frequencies better than the other two bridges, it could potentially allow the violin to produce a “brighter” sound quality. The hypothesis was partially supported.

RAISING THE RAYLEIGH NUMBER: PLUMES AND CIRCULATION IN TURBULENT THERMAL CONVECTION
Meredith Ann MacGregor
Fairview High School, Boulder, Colorado, USA

<br><br> An experimental study of thermal convection in water was conducted, in order to investigate the distinctive features of turbulent heat transport at Rayleigh numbers Ra>4x10^7. The thermal properties of states with 6.2x10^7<Ra<1.6x10^8 were measured in a cylindrical convection cell of aspect ratio one with a resistively heated bottom and a thermoelectrically cooled top. Temperature measurements were made using a LabVIEW-controlled data acquisition system to sample and store the outputs of thermistors inside the cell at time intervals between 0.1 and 1.0 seconds. Fluctuations, arising from both warm and cool plumes, were prevalent throughout the fluid, with the largest (>1 C) found near the top and bottom plates. The time-averaged temperature profile varied only in two thin boundary layers adjacent to the container top and bottom, with the temperature everywhere else about equal to the average of the top and bottom temperatures. Heat flux measurements showed that the Nusselt number varied as Ra^0.29, consistent with previous results but different from the Ra^1/3 dependence for lower Ra. The histogram of temperature fluctuations derived from a large number of measurements was found to fall off less steeply than the Gaussian distribution typical of lower Ra, indicating that large fluctuations are more likely. The existence of a large-scale flow inside the container was demonstrated by successive detections of advected plumes in two horizontally separated thermistors. The inferred flow properties suggest a continuous, single loop circulation around the inner surface of the cell with an average peak speed of about 4-5 mm/s.<br><br>

INVESTIGATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPINGING WATER DROPLETS AND THE LEIDENFROST PHENOMENON
Adreanne Laree Brungardt
Brush High School, Brush, Colorado, USA

In this present paper the researcher investigates in detail the impact of a water drop traveling at various velocities on a heated smooth surface which is at an angle of 10 degrees to the path of the water drop (80 degrees in relationship to the horizontal). The main goal of this present research is to investigate the relationship between the velocity of a water drop and its interaction with a heated surface. A secondary goal is to log the various regimes of daughter droplets produced from this interaction. A third goal is to develop a model of the relationship of the drop's velocity and the temperature at which the Leidenfrost phenomenon first appeared. This research documents the dynamic relationship between Leidenfrost point and parent drop velocity at an angle of 10 degrees to the path of the parent drop. One of the main features of the model developed for this relationship is in the model's simplicity. If the energy (velocity) of the parent drop is greater than what the vapor can support at a given temperature then either steam or secondary droplets are produced. If the vapor produced at the interface of the vapor/drop boundary then a single-drop daughter droplet is produced.

ULTRASONIC DETECTOR (USD) FOR GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY

Paul-Gerhardt-Gymnasium, Graefenhainichen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany

A gas chromatograph (GC) is an apparatus, which has the possibility to separate a gas mixture and to determine its components. I got the idea to invent a new detector for the GC basing on the relation between ultrasound velocity and molecular mass of gases.<br><br> After experiments with ultrasound sensors I constructed the first Version of the USD by using metal cases. In addition I developed a suitable electronics comparing the phases of the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to interpret the signals of the detector. Also a program to picture its data is a part of my project. To miniaturize and improve the system I created different versions of the detector.<br><br> Later I improvised separating columns separating gas mixtures with plastic tubes. I experimented with different fillings, like poppy seed and bird sand, and different films, like silicone oil. So I was able to separate mixtures like lighter gas (propane-butane). In addition with an aquarium pump, tubes and styrofoam, all developed components could be completed to a kind of a “low-cost” GC. <br><br> Additionally I could successfully verify the functionality of the detector with the aid of a real gas chromatograph. So its pictured chromatogram can be used to investigate gas mixtures.<br><br> The advantages in comparison to other detectors are that the detector is very high-resolution, cheap and easy to handle. The whole apparatus is a cheaper (rebuilding costs of my “low cost” GC: ca. 50$) alternative to more expensive systems (price of a GC: ca. 2000$ and higher). <br><br>

OPTIMIZATION RESEARCH ON DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS

Energy and environment are two main problems now. Fossil fuels are not renewable energy, and their excessive exploitation pollutes our environment. One of the best ways to solve these problems is to use solar energy--- an inexhaustible kind of energy with little impact on the environment. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a new kind of solar cell. Compared with others, DSSCs have the advantage of much higher performance-to-price ratio, which gives it a promising market.<br><br> <br><br> In my work, a new formula has been developed to fabricate TiO2 porous films, which have the merits of strong adhesion to the substrate, smooth surface, and controllable porosity and pore size. I also designed and synthesized a new solid-state electrolyte --- LiI-HPN. This kind of electrolyte has a suitable melting point of 100celcius and high conductivity of 10 Simens per centimeter. With these materials a new DSSC has been obtained. At a light intensity of 60 mW per square centimeter, the open current of the DSSC reaches 8.75 mA per square centimeter and the short voltage is 0.618V. The highest energy conversion efficiency reaches 5.0 %, which is the best result so far.<br><br> <br><br> The main contribution of the present work is the development of new solid-state electrolyte and the TiO2 film for assembling DSSC. This DSSC can efficiently drive a mini fan under sunlight, which shows the cell has a stable energy output. My study lays a foundation for potential applications in the future.<br><br>

COMMISSIONING A DPD-3 DIODE SYSTEM FOR IN-VIVO DOSE VERIFICATION OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT
Gurjit Singh Sidhu
Saint Johns Roman Catholic High School, Scotland, United Kingdom

Radiotherapy is the treatment of cancer with high energy X-Rays produced by Linear Accelerators. Each patient’s treatment is individually planned using a computerized treatment planning system and the treatment machines are calibrated to deliver the required does. It is helpful to be able to verify that the correct does has been delivered to the patient. One method of achieving this is to measure the does delivered to the surface of the patient during treatment, using a semiconductor diode detector system. The aim of the project is to commission a DPD-3 Diode System for use at a hospital in Dundee.<br><br>The commissioning process started by investigating the linearity of the diode response, the consistency of repeated measurements and deriving a diode calibration factor for a standard set-up. Further measurements were made to determine correction factors for variations to this standard set-up that may occur in practical use such as a change in temperature, or a change in the incident angle of radiation.<br><br>The tests verified that the equipment was suitable for measuring patient doses and a calibration factor was calculated to convert the reading from the diode into dose to water, in Grays, for standard condition. Further tests showed that no correction factor is required if the Source to Surface Distance is altered, however correction factors are required depending on the angle of the beam to the diode, the temperature of the diode and the area to be irradiated.<br><br>

BUBBLE, BUBBLE, TOIL AND TROUBLE
Michelle Elise Johnson
Nettleton Junior High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, USA

When experimenting with different types of bubbles, the experimenter [myself] discovered an entirely new type of bubble. These bubbles did not behave in the same way as air bubbles since they rose to the surface noticeably more slowly. Experiments were conducted to prove that these “unknown bubbles” (as termed by the experimenter) were not regular air bubbles. <br><br> An aquarium was filled partway with soapy water and two hundred of the unknown bubbles were created and timed as they rose 2.54 cm (1 inch). Similarly, one hundred air bubbles were timed as they rose 13.34 cm (5.25 inches) (a stopwatch couldn’t be operated fast enough to time them for 2.54 cm). These times were divided by 5.25 so they could be compared with the unknown bubbles.<br><br> Unknown bubbles took an average of seventeen times longer than air bubbles to rise the same distance. Other behaviors inconsistent with air bubbles were also observed, including the fact that sometimes an unknown bubble popped: simply disappeared, leaving a tiny air bubble that rose quickly to the surface. Also, when unknown bubbles reached the surface they did not breach it the way air bubbles did, and sometimes even bounced off, moving towards the bottom of the tank before rising again. These results are consistent with a new type of bubble, one filled with and surrounded by water, but with a thin layer of air in between.<br><br>

HOW ATTRACTIVE ARE YOUR MAGNETS? A THIRD YEAR STUDY
William James Shupe
Seguin High School, Seguin, Texas, United States

Electro-permanent magnets are permanent magnets surrounded by an electromagnet which are used to lift items without power and to release the items by putting a charge through the electromagnet. The electro-permanent magnet is not completely understood. If these magnets were understood, more efficient magnets could be made. Specifically, the researcher sought to identify if the reaction between the permanent and electromagnet is a linear reaction, or if the reaction amplifies or diminishes the total strength of the electromagnet non-linearly. The researcher sought to discover this by using a calibrated magnetometer, a device that measures the strength of the magnets in gauss. The researcher hypothesized that, by surrounding a permanent magnet with an electromagnet, the result would be the fields diminishing from each other in a non-linear function. Alnico cylinder magnets were used to perform the test. The permanent magnet was surrounded by an electromagnet and run through a series of tests using the magnetometer with the orientation of the electromagnet North to the permanent magnet's North and then the electromagnet's South to the permanent magnet's North with varying amps. Separate trials were done using the same power range using just the solenoid. A comparison was made using the results from all tests. It was noticed that while the electromagnet was measured at the same level regardless of the electricity applied, the electromagnet affected the permanent magnet more than a simple addition of field strengths. The hypothesis was supported, with the electromagnet affecting a permanent magnet in a non-linear function.

THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF COBALT AND IRON-NICKEL BASED AMORPHOUS METAL RIBBONS AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES
Jonathan Joseph Naber
Waterloo High School, Waterloo, Illinois, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to find the electrical conductivity of cobalt and iron-nickel based amorphous metal ribbons at cryogenic temperatures. I hypothesized that the resistance would be very low and possibly show a sharp dropping tendency toward superconductivity. The amorphous metal ribbons investigated were B(1-5%) Co(75-85%) Fe(1-5%) Mo(1-5%) Ni(1-5%) Si(3-7%) and B(1-5%) Fe(40-50%) Mo(5-10%) Ni(40-50%) Co (.3%max). The samples had voltage drop and thermocouple leads attached to monitor the resistance and temperature simultaneously on voltmeters over a wide range of temperatures. For the liquid nitrogen phase of the experiment, a thermally massive probe was built to hold the samples, and to reduce temperature gradients during cooling and warming. Each trial consisted of pouring liquid nitrogen onto the probe in a styrofoam cup and allowing it to reach 77 K. The probe was then allowed to warm to room temperature. Five trials were conducted for each of the two samples. Although the resistance was found to be moderately high, an extremely small temperature coefficient of resistance and a possible phase transition around 116 K were found. To extend the data for the cobalt based sample to lower temperatures, a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) was used to take resistance readings down to 4 K, liquid helium temperature. Three trials were run without a magnetic field and three were run in a 100 gauss field. Although superconductivity was not found, electron localization was observed, which resulted in a sharp jump in resistance at the lowest temperatures.

THE EFFECT OF EOLIC ENERGY AND SOLAR ENERGY IN THE OPERATION OF A HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO
ROBERTO JOSE MANZANO
COLGEGIO DE LA SALLE HIGH SCHOOL, BAYAMON,PUERTO RICO

THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO TEST IF A HOUSE CAN COMBINE EOLIC ENERGY AND SOLAR ENERGY SOURCES IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN OPERATE IN ANY OF THE PRESENTLY EXISTING HOUSES IN PUERTO RICO. TWO SCALE MODEL HOUSES WITH SOLAR PANELS AND AN EOLIC GENERATOR OR WINDMILL ARE PREPARED. ONE MODEL IS PLACED IN AN AREA EXPOSED TO DIRECT SOLAR LIGHT, WITH ITS PANELS FACING TO THE SOUTH AT AN ANGLE OF 18 FOR A PERIOD OF 5 DAYS. THE ELECTRIC CHARGE OF 2 BATTERIES OF 9 VOLTS EACH WHICH PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO THE HOUSE IS MEASURED DAILY. AT 6:00 PM EACH DAY, 4 LIGHT BULBS ARE TURNED ON UNTIL THE BATTERIES ARE DRAINED AND THE TIME ELAPSED IS MEASURED. DURING THIS PERIOD, WIND SPEED IS MEASURED WITH A WIND GAUGE, AND COMPARED WITH METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION SERVICES READINGS.THE SECOND MODEL IS USED TO TAKE WIND MEASURES IN TWO OTHER AREAS. BASED ON THE 5 DAYS TESTED, WIND SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FOR 15 ADDITIONAL DAYS.<br><br>THE EXPERIMENT PROVED THAT AN EOLIC AND SOLAR HOUSE COULD OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY IF THE AVERAGE WINDS RECEIVED BY THE WINDMILL WERE BETWEEN 9 AND 16 MILES PER HOUR. THE MOUNTAIN AND COASTAL REGIONS WERE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. THIS PROVES THE VIABILTY TO TRANSFORM PRESENTLY EXISTING HOUSES IN PUERTO RICO INTO EOLIC AND SOLAR HOUSES IF WE CONSIDER THE ANGLE AND DIRECTION OF SOLAR PANELS AND THE AVERAGE WIND SPEEDS OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF SYNTHETIC OIL IN A SMALL ENGINE
Justin Everett Eide
Winona Senior High School, Winona, Minnesota

The purpose of this experiment was to discover which oil, synthetic or petroleum, would produce optimal horsepower and torque results in a small engine. It was hypothesized that synthetic 5W-30 motor oil would produce more horsepower and torque than petroleum. The crankcase of the Tecumseh 6.5 hp. engine was filled with 5W-30 petroleum oil and the engine started and allowed to warm up for five minutes to reach operating temperature. Thirty dyno pulls were run and the data recorded using “Dyno-Max 2000” data acquisition software. The crank case was then drained and refilled with 5W-30 synthetic oil. The engine was allowed to warm up and then the thirty pulls were run and the data recorded. The results revealed that synthetic oil provided a 12% increase in horsepower and a 19% increase in torque over petroleum. It was believed that this occurred because synthetic oil provides an increase in lubrication over petroleum. More lubrication means less friction horsepower, which is the amount of horsepower that is lost due to internal friction, which, in turn provides an increase in brake horsepower. Future plans for this study should include testing the fuel economy of the engine using synthetic and petroleum, and also using oil analysis testers to determine the longevity of both the synthetic and petroleum.

WINGS PHASE II
Christopher Bradley Schultz
Union Grove High School; McDonough, Georgia: United States of America

The problem addressed in this year's phase of the experiment is to determine if the wing stalls at the same angle of attack for all air speeds, by increasing the wing's angle of attack against all air speeds. To further analyze the results, the coefficient of lift and drag along with the lift/drag values will be computed. The reason this project was chosen was to determine the affect of the angle of attack on lift and to determine at what angle of attack the wing will stall. The expected result of this project was that a stall would occur at thirty-degree angle of attack for all air speeds. The procedures followed involved setting the digital scale to zero and set the wing to zero-degree angle of attack. The drag and lift scale pressure was checked and recorded. The wing's angle of attack was adjusted by two degrees until a forty-degree angle of attack was reached. This was done ten times for each setting. The average lift and drag values were calculated by using a computer program I wrote. The coefficients of drag and lift and lift/drag values were calculated. The result of this experiment was that thirty-two degrees was the stall angle of attack that achieved the maximum lifting ability for all air speeds. Thus, the hypothesis that thirty-degree angle of attack would cause a stall for all air speeds was disproved.

THE EFFECT OF DATA BEING MANIPULATED TO FIT INTO THE THEORIES OF HELIOCENTRISM
Dominique Marianna Cox
Morenci High School, Morenci, Michigan, USA

Researching how astronomical data could be manipulated to fit into the theories of heliocentrism and geocentrism was important to the understanding of fourteenth and fifteenth century astronomy. Several astronomers supported one theory over another and some were punished for this. This may have pushed scientific advancement back several centuries. It was hypothesized that one set of data collected from computer software and observations could support both the theories of geocentrism and heliocentrism. <br><br>The orbits and visual motions of five planets, the stars, the moon, and the sun were recorded for six days over a three week period. The altitudes of the moon were graphed and the paths of the nightly motions of certain celestial bodies were charted. The planets’ orbits create interesting tendencies in the data collected. As the planets of the solar system move outward from the center, their orbits become less complex. The orbits of the planets could have been explained by either theory, though heliocentrism would support the variabilities of the orbits with less complexity than geocentrism. The nightly paths of all objects seemed to arc across the sky east to west. <br><br>The hypothesis that one set of data would support both the theory of heliocentrism and the theory of geocentrism was clearly supported. All collected pieces of data supported this conclusion. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it seems that it was easy to be confused about why one astronomer supported one theory, and another astronomer the other theory.

ROOM TEMPERATURE FERROMAGNETISM IN GERMANIUM MANGANESE THIN FILM SEMICONDUCTORS
Lynwood James Walker Jr.
Hahnville High School, Boutte, Louisiana, USA

We investigated manganese doped germanium as a possible ferromagnetic semiconductor at room temperature. To examine how the ferromagnetic properties vary with composition, films were grown at target ratios 60/40, 85/15, and 97/3 germanium to manganese. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) was performed to verify that the actual film compositions are in the target range. Magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field to study the ferromagnetic properties of the films. Resistance versus temperature measurements were also used to determine whether the films are semiconductive or metallic. Finally, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) tests were run to determine whether the films have an amorphous or crystalline structural arrangement of atoms. We successfully grew GeMn thin films of actual compositions 75/25, 83/17, and 98/2 that are amorphous, ferromagnetic semiconductors above room temperature. In addition, we determined that the germanium manganese sample of composition 98/2 has the most favorable properties for further study of electron-spin injection into semiconductors.<br><br><br><br><br>

RESONANCE PATTERNS OF VIBRATING SOAP WATER DROPLETS
Po-Chun Kuo
National Hsinchu Senior High School, Hsinchu, Taiwan

The resonant patterns of vibrating soap water droplets, deposited on a vertically oscillating plastic film that was driven by a mechanical shaker, have been studied. Both of the vibrating amplitude and frequency of the plastic film were found to be physically significant parameters in affecting the resonant patterns. Ring-shape excitations developed in the situations when small amplitudes were used for vibration. Increasing amplitude may be resulted in the formation of finger-like sub-droplets, which were isolated from the ring structure. The sharp of the sub-droplets was found to be strongly depended on the vibrating frequency, which in terms affecting the acceleration of the vibrating soap water droplet. In addition, the volume of the soap water droplet was also found to be another physically affective parameter, which sets the minimum driven energy needed for creating isolated sub-droplets. Possible mechanisms for the splitting of a ring-sharp structure into a sub-droplet structure were also presented.

POLARIZATION DYNAMICS OF YTTERBIUM DOPED SILICA FIBER LASER
Alexander Chernyak
International Academy, Boomfield Hills, Michigan, United States

An Ytterbium-doped silica fiber laser was investigated at low pump-powers through the polarization dependence of saturation of absorption in the non-pumped partition of the active fiber. Following an incremental increase in pump-power, the dependence of the output-power of two polarized waves from time and pump-power was analyzed. This study was inspired by two previous publications which received directly conflicting results at two different non-pumped partition fiber lengths. Consequentially an intermediary fiber length was employed. The results demonstrated that pump-power has a significant effect on wave behavior; the data obtained showed three contrary behaviors of waves depending upon the pump-power: <br><br>1) At borderline threshold pump-power, one wave generated while the output emission was linearly polarized. 2) With an increase of pump-power, rare random transitions occurred between the orthogonally polarized waves, the generation of the two waves alternated from wave one to wave two. 3) With an even greater increase in the pump-power the output emission became depolarized, as the two waves coexisted.<br><br>This study discovered that an increase in the length of the non-pumped part of the active fiber greatly affects the polarized radiation of the Yb3+-laser. <br><br>It was revealed that in the presence of an external controlling influence, forced rather than random polarization switching occurs. This effect could be utilized in polarization-sensitive reflectometers which catalyze the speed of the transmission of information in communication networks. <br><br>At low pump-powers, there was a regime of organized chaos, which indicates a dynamic and stochastic behavior of the Yb3+-laser, which with further research has tremendous encryption applications.<br><br>

SOUND BLOCKAGE
Sarah Lane Menezes
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil

The purpose of this project is to find out which material commonly used in windows would best block sound.<br><br> In order to do this, a single, constant note was played by an electronic keyboard. The note was then captured by two microphones and recorded and processed in a PC. The first microphone was placed inside a wooden, sound insulated box and the other was placed outside the box. The sound recorded inside the box was captured when the box was opened and when it had a lid. The lid was made of different materials (plastic, wood, iron, aluminum and glass). Each material was tested six times, three times in the form of a solid board and three times in the form of a window shutter.<br><br> The results showed that in the form of a solid board, plastic blocked 87.44%, aluminum 86.40%, wood 85.41%, iron 83.96% and glass 83.45%. In the form of a window shutter, wood blocked 79.5%, plastic 58.95%, iron 47.92%, aluminum 45.51% and glass 45.21%. The conclusion was that plastic is the best sound insulator, but what really makes a difference is if the material contains openings or not, through which sound can travel freely.<br><br>

WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER BY ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
Samuel James Bobb
Rutherford B. Hayes, Delaware, Ohio, USA

Wireless power transfer is facilitated by mutual inductance. An oscillating current in one coil of wire induces an electrical voltage in another coil that is not physically connected. This experiment addresses the question, “What is the effect of the transmission frequency, distance between coils, and transmission angle on induced voltage in the secondary coil?” Faraday’s Law suggests that these three variables have an effect on induced voltage.<br><br>The experimental setup consisted of a primary and secondary coil antenna. An oscillating current was applied to the primary coil, producing a changing magnetic field around this coil. The changing magnetic field passing through the secondary coil induced a voltage in the secondary coil. The effects of frequency, distance, and transmission angle on induced voltage were measured. <br><br>Induced voltage was affected by frequency, distance, and angle. The relationship between voltage and frequency shows a peak in voltage that may result from a band-pass filter circuit. As distance increased, voltage decreased in the form of a power curve. Induced voltage decreased as angle between coils increased from 0 degrees to 90 degrees. <br><br>Wireless power transfer is used in transformers and in radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. This experiment also led to exploration of another practical application: a wireless battery charger. The optimal orientation for the coils in the battery charger was determined using the data relating angle between coils to induced voltage.<br><br>

GETTING STARTED ON THE RIGHT FOOT AN EVALUATION OF EQUINE ARENA FOOTING MAERIALS
Megan Jean Webb
Keyser High School, Keyser, West Virginia

Musculoskeletal injuries are worldwide the major reason why horses are forced to quit their career. Hoof ground interaction must be studied to prevent injuries in today's performance horse. Sir Isacc's Newton's third law of motion states, "For every force exerted by one body there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the second body on the first". During the stance loading phase of the horse's stride an average horse can exert nearly 6000 Newton's of vertical ground reaction force.<br><br> Most equine arenas are constructed with two layers, a looser cushion on top of a firmer base. It is this top two to three inches that is crucial to the performance and soundness of the horse. Hard surfaces absorb LITTLE ENERGY and are associated with a HIGH INCIDENCE of lameness. According to scientists the loose top layer of 2-3 INCHES can give response values that REDUCE impact/concussion by forty to sixty percent.<br><br> This experiment studied four different and common equine arena footing materials evaluating them using four different criteria. These criteria included compaction, shock absorbency, resistance to flow/stability, and resistance to freezing. In order to physically test each material the student researcher utilized laboratory equipment at the WV Division of Highways.<br><br> Upon completion of this experiment a sand rubber blend was chosen as the best overall footing material. The student researcher plans on installing this material in her present outdoor arena to promote soundness in the horses she has involved in athletic training.<br><br> <br><br>

THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE: A TWO YEAR STUDY COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS ANALYSIS OF A MUFFLER
Jessica Ann Goldstayn
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma Tennessee, United States

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software for evaluating the performance of a passive muffler attenuating noise without creating excess backpressure. The ramps were formed using prisms with different ramp angles and placement distances. The software was used to calculate average area pressures at the inlet and outlet faces to determine the difference. <br><br> Six different angles of the ramps were tested, and visually and numerically analyzed. A linear relationship between vertex angle and backpressure was found. Four cases of placement were tested, and revealed a decreasing exponential relationship between the distance between placement and backpressure. <br><br> All cases were analyzed through numerical pressure drop, velocity vectors, and streamlines to discern trends in pressure loss. Theoretical data was compared to physical data that was a product of a previous year’s experimentation. Since the CFD data was within the range of the physical test data, the validity of the computerized model was confirmed. <br><br> The experiment was successful in proving the ability of CFD to optimize the backpressure in a muffler design for a given set of conditions. Creating an acoustic model of the muffler, which could be used with the backpressure model validated in this experiment, could complete analysis of the prototype. This model would allow a dual variable optimization of the performance of a prototype for a specific application. Additionally, the prototype demonstrates superior sound attenuation to commercially available mufflers that enhances the value of a computational tool for fabricating prototypes. <br><br>

A NOVEL SIMULATION OF GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
Aliza Ilana Malz
Hunter College High School, New York NY, USA

A computer program has been developed in Microsoft Visual Basic to simulate optics and astronomy experiments. The program is intended primarily to enable astronomers to determine the mass distribution and location of dark matter via the comparison of astronomical observations to controlled digital experiments using data from known luminous objects. Differences between experimental results and observations can be attributed to dark matter, whose mass distribution and location can then be determined from the magnitudes and locations of the differences. Additional applications include optimizing the design of optical lenses used in data storage and satellite communication as well as enhancing education in classical optics. <br><br>The user creates lenses and defines luminous objects using geometric equations, spatial coordinates, and rotations. By tracing the light’s path accurately and precisely through the lenses using the laws of optics and adjusting for changes in brightness when images are dilated or duplicated, the program creates a final image of the object that is projected onto a “screen” -- the equivalent of the astronomer’s eye. In addition to classically observed phenomena, the program can simulate numerous gravitational lensing distortions such as an Einstein Ring. <br><br>This program provides a method to determine the location and mass distribution of dark matter and has the potential to further our understanding of the structure and fate of the universe via the creation of a dark matter map. Optical laws may be better understood using this program without the use of imprecise light sources and expensive yet imperfect laboratory lenses. <br><br>

PROPELLANTLESS PROPULSION: THE EFFECT OF ELECTRODE GEOMETRY ON THE THRUST OUTPUT OF AN ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITOR
Stephen Jerome Trettel
New Prague High School, New Prague, Minnesota, United States of America

The objective of this research was to determine if the ratio of asymmetry between a capacitor's electrodes, as determined by surface area, had an effect on the net thrust produced. It was hypothesized that at a constant capacitor length, greater ratios of asymmetry between the electrodes would produce stronger net thrust.<br><br>To perform the experiment, four asymmetrical capacitors were constructed, with increasing ratios of asymmetry between the electrodes. Configuration 1, being symmetrical, was the experimental control. The ratios of asymmetry for Configurations 2, 3, and 4 were 1:7, 1:59, and 1:118 respectively.<br><br>The configurations were tested by adding mass, in 0.1 gram increments, until the thrust was no longer able to compensate for the mass. The total mass lifted by the capacitor, being proportional to the thrust, was used to compare the configurations during analysis.<br><br>In the experiment, greater ratios of asymmetry produced stronger thrust, as hypothesized. However, as the ratio of asymmetry increases, the mass of the lower electrode consequently increases, lowering the payload capability. This points to a potential configuration where the mass of the lower electrode and the additional thrust gained by the increased ratio of asymmetry are optimized — creating the most efficient design.<br><br>The data collected in this experiment successfully completed the objective and can hopefully be used in the future to uncover more about the anomalous thrust produced by an asymmetrical capacitor.

CONSUMABLE OIL ENCAPSULATED SPHEROIDS (COES): DISCOVERY AND APPLICATIONS
Michael J. Pizer
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53217, USA

This research has resulted in the discovery of Consumable Oil Encapsulated Spheroids (COES). These novel fluid objects consist of a food oil shell enclosing a liquid core. COES are formed by dropping or streaming liquid through a confined layer of oil on the surface of a container or body of water. The feasibility of using COES as a depth specific chemical delivery system was studied. <br><br><br> Research demonstrated that COES are extremely resistant to great depths and high pressure. Also, research indicated that both temperature of the inner liquid and flow rate of oil making up the shell have significant impact on duration. Changes in either of these factors allow duration to be precisely controlled. Increases in temperature and/or flow rate resulted in shorter durations. Sinking rates of COES with varying densities were investigated as well. Precise control of duration, coupled with sinking rate information, allows the breaking depth of COES to be pinpointed.<br><br><br> Further, an automated COES Generator was designed and shown to generate COES with close to 100% efficiency. To handle the rare occurrence of early COES breakage, a vacuum recovery system was developed. <br><br><br> With a COES Generator and the ability to control breaking depth, COES can be used as an efficient, environmentally sound chemical delivery mechanism. Treatment waste and undesirable contamination can be avoided, as chemicals will only go to specific regions in a body of water where they are intended. Additional applications of COES (that could be detected by sonar) include submarine defense and monitoring subsurface currents.

IS THE LEVITATION OF A NDFEB MAGNET AFFECTED BY TEMPERATURE, BIAS MAGNET STRENGTH, DIAMAGNETIC MATERIAL, OR PLATE SEPARATION?
Allyson Patricia Werner
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI, United States

Abstract<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to determine how a levitated neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnet is affected by bias magnet (BM) strength, temperature, diamagnetic plate separation, or diamagnetic plate composition. <br><br> A stand was constructed whereupon a NdFeB magnet levitated between diamagnetic plates below a BM. Optimal magnetic levitation was defined as: stable magnet position at all points between two diamagnetic plates at widest plate separation, greatest distance from BM to levitated magnet (LM), and widest range of BM heights that maintained a LM between diamagnetic plates. <br><br> Increasing BM field strength (BM number ranged from one to eight) allowed a 19% greater BM height above the LM with a greater range of stability in diamagnetic plate separation and BM height.<br><br> Temperatures tested ranged from -40ºC to 43°C. As temperature increased, magnetic levitation could only be accomplished at a lower BM height with 50% less range in BM height and less diamagnetic plate separation. <br><br> Plates of bismuth (Bi) or pyrolytic graphite (PG) were tested. Plate separation started at three (3) mm and was increased by one (1) mm increments until levitation became unstable. Plate separation varied with BM strength and temperature. At identical BM field strength and temperatures, Bi plate separation could not be increased beyond four (4) mm, while PG plate separation over six (6) mm was demonstrated.<br><br> In this experiment, optimal levitation occurred with: pyrolytic graphite plates at six (6) mm separation, the strongest BM strength possible, and a temperature between -6º C to l8º C.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF VARIATION OF THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE ON COSMIC RAY FLUX
Jordan Tyler Bishop
Manhattan High School 2100 Poyntz Ave. Manhattan, KS 66502

This experiment analyzes the abundance of cosmic radiation at different angles from zenith. Cosmic radiation is made of positively charged particles traveling at nearly the speed of light. Their direction is altered by natural magnetic fields and therefore is extremely random. Once primary cosmic rays collide with natural particles in the atmosphere; a muon is produced. The muon travels to Earth and is detected using a student-constructed cosmic radiation detector. 220 – one minute trials were run for seven different angles. Data is generalized for comparison by calculating the flux; flux was calculated so I could compare my data to theory. My prediction was that there would be fewer muons as the detectors angle deviated from the zenith. I predicted this because research indicated that a muon’s lifetime was too short to travel the longer distance from larger angles. The larger counts would occur when the muon travels the shortest distance. When the observed flux was compared with the prediction from theory, it was consistent as shown by statistical analysis. <br><br>

SUPRESSING CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR WITH VIBRATIONS
Brandon John Campbell
Fremont High School, Plain City UT, US

This project is an investigation into the effect of vibration on a chaotic pendulum. It was hypothesized that by vibrating the pendulum, adjacent, diverging orbits would be averaged, causing the orbit of the pendulum to become less chaotic. This was shown to be true because vibrating pendulums had more uniform periods (shown by Fourier analysis) and lessened the tendency for individual runs to deviate from the mean path. This is different from other research because the vibration of the pendulum did not drive the pendulum. The motion of the pendulum slowed at the same rate, regardless of vibration. This is shown by Fourier analysis as well.

CAN CARBON NANOTUBES IMPROVE MATERIAL STRENGTH? IMPROVING BULLETPROOF VEST STRENGTH-YEAR TWO
Graham Edward Gintz
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes blended with metal resin epoxy create a polymer composite material strong enough to resist a range of bullets fired from handguns at close range.<br><br> Experiments were conducted comparing two different manufacturers of single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Mixtures were blended by hand and with automated blending techniques in both low and high temperature and humidity to determine the effects on the bonding strength of the material in its final form. Further experimentation was conducted on the importance of adding energy, a near electric field, both in close proximity and directly to the curing process to determine its effect on the material. Sample concentrations of carbon nanotubes ranging from .10 to 1 percent were made. Testing was conducted at an indoor range with .22, .380 and 9 mm handguns to determine material effectiveness. <br><br> It was found by experimentation that a 1% concentration of single walled carbon nanotubes, when disbursed with a rotary mixing tool at a temperature of 22„aC, 50% relative humidity in the presence of a 6-volt direct current near electric field for seven hours, yielded an effective material. Samples demonstrating bullet resistance were evaluated using a focused ion beam to understand their complex reaction formation. An on going twelve month life test is underway to evaluate the impact of the environment on the material in a real world setting.<br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF THICKNESS, LOW TEMPERATURE, AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY ON THE ATTENUATION OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH
Amber C. Kirk
Coon Rapids High School, Coon Rapids, MN, USA.

The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of thickness and temperature of a material on the material's shielding ability in regards to a magnetic field. It was hypothesized that the thickness and temperature of a material would increase the material's attenuation, thus increasing its shielding ability. Another objective was to find the effect of superconductivity on a magnetic field, and to understand superconductivity. It was hypothesized that the field would be reflected upward above the superconducting disk, and the disk would shield the magnetic field below itself when superconductivity is induced. To study the first two objectives, the magnetic field strength was tested through material shields at different thicknesses and temperatures at predetermined control points. Then the measurements were compared using graphs to find the atttenuation, contour plots to visualize the magnetic field, and t-tests were used to find the statistical significance of the measurements. The results of the comparisons showed that thickness had a significant effect on a material's attenuation. Temperature was not found to have a significant effect on a material's attenuation. Superconductivity did have a similar effect to that which was hypothesized. It was found that when superconductivity was induced, the magnetic field was moved upward and the disk acted as a magnetic shield. Also, the levitation of the magnet was observed, demonstrating the Meisner effect. This information is useful in medicine and technology applications.

THE EFFECT OF RELAXATION ON THE RATE OF SOLID PHASE EPITAXIAL REGROWTH (SPER)
Yuchen Huo
J. W. Mitchell High School, New Port Richey, Florida, U. S. A.

The focus of this experiment is to discover the effect of relaxation on the rate of regrowth of crystalline silicon from the amorphous silicon by measuring the thickness of the amorphous layer using a technique named variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, or VASE. It is believed that the relaxed amorphous silicon will have lower SPER velocity (rate) and higher activation energy than the unrelaxed silicon. <br><br>Amorphized silicon wafers were cleaved into a sample matrix, half of which received relaxation anneal. Then all the samples were annealed at various temperatures for different lengths of time. After each anneal, the amorphous layer thickness of each sample was measured using VASE and XTEM, or cross-section transmission electron microscope. These procedures were repeated until the amorphous layer of each sample was completely recrystallized. <br><br>It was observed that at each temperature regime, the relaxed samples had lower velocity of regrowth than the unrelaxed samples. The activation energy of the relaxed samples, as predicted, was higher than the unrelaxed samples, meaning it would require more energy for amorphous layer in the relaxed samples to regrow.<br><br>This finding suggests that relaxation can be used as an effective technique to increase the amount of solid dopants soluble in amorphous silicon at a higher temperature without recrystalizing the amorphous layer. Higher solid solubility will result in higher conductivity of the material and thus advance silicon-based semiconductor devices in the future.<br><br>

A NON-INTRUSIVE INVESTIGATION OF A SIMULATED BALL LIGHTNING PHENOMENON IN MY MICROWAVE OVEN
Joshua David Kalin
Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL, USA

A microwave oven's ability to generate simulated ball lightning in a controlled environment was investigated. The study of plasmoid generation in a microwave oven dates back to the very creation of the microwave oven in the 1950's. Sightings of natural ball lightning have been discussed as early as 1000 or more years ago. This project, though, deals with the theory that a stable simulated ball lightning can be easily created in a relatively safe, controlled microwave oven. The hypothesis is that a simulated ball lightning can be used to prove and disprove some theories currently circulating about natural ball lightning. This project does assert that the simulated ball lightning could be hot enough to be dangerous to bystanders and property. This project also investigates a theory as to why and how ball lightning may be affected by the surroundings. As this project progressed, various methods of plasmoid creation were seen as being obsolete in comparison to the success of the two predominant methods applied in the testing phase of this project. After the data was processed, the hottest plasmoid temperature was found to be above 4000 Kelvins. Even though each experiment was time consuming, the data was interesting enough to warrant further research. Considering the temperature of the sun's surface is somewhere between 5500 and 6000 Kelvins, I was amazed that I could even come close to producing a similar value in my microwave oven.

STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY OF SILK THREAD FROM NEPHILA CLAVIPES
Rodolfo Sebastian Norniella Parache
Colegio Sagrado Corazón, San Miguel de Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina

The industry of nowadays requires ultralight, ductile and strong materials which can be used in the manufacture of useful devices. The examination of spiders allowed us the discovery of strength and ductility of silk thread from Nephila Clavipes species.<br><br>Through and electronic microscope it was noticed that the thread is made up by five filaments (not fully bound) with a 3,5 microns diameter each.<br><br>The strength and ductility of the thread was measured by means of 0.1308 grs. weights each. The weight/deformation ratio was calculated until the ruptura point was reached. The five filaments thread can stand a weight of 6.0062 grs. By transforming these results into measurements generally used in Engineering, first establishing the area of the five filaments in mm2 and later computing the maximum tensile stress (T=P:A), a maximum strength of 1215.6 MPa or 124 Kg/mm2 and a ductility of 39.5% was obtained.<br><br>From these measurements, we can assert that a material with a directly proportional ratio strength/ductility was found. This material exceeds in strength and broadly in ductility the mechanical properties of other materials of industrial use, such as steels whose ratio strength/ductility is inversely proportional.<br><br>Comparing these results with high strength steel - maximum strength 900 MPa or 91.8 kg/mm2 and a 7.5% ductility – and mild steel with a maximum strength of 350 MPa or 35.7 kg/mm2 and a 27% ductility , we can assert that the silk thread from the Nephila clavipes is a unique material.<br><br>

THE TURNING POINTE THE PHYSICS OF A PIROUETTE
Arielle Kathryn Rollins
Westfield High School, Westfield, Massachusetts, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to study the components of pirouettes en dehors initiating from fourth position. I hypothesized that a greater turn rate would result from a deeper plie for pirouettes from fourth position.<br><br>Three student dancers were digitally videoed performing double pirouettes. These videos were analyzed in VideoPoint 2.5 for the position of the center of mass and the plie depth. For each video, a position vs. time graph of center of mass was created and the second derivative was taken to find its acceleration. The vertical force exerted as a proportion of the dancer's weight was determined by finding the sum of acceleration due to gravity and the acceleration of the center of mass and dividing it by acceleration due to gravity. The vertical force/weight vs. time graphs have peaks above and below 1.00 where the vertical force is equal to the dancer's weight. Points above 1.00 represent upward acceleration with a force greater than the body weight, and points below 1.00 represent the body slowing down in its ascent to the turn.<br><br>Although the plie depth does have some effect on the rotational velocity of a pirouette, none of the data obtained supports it as the explanation of a faster turn rate. It was discovered that greater rotational velocity results from the "wind up," a storing of momentum in the arms during the preparation of a turn.<br><br>Although I did not prove my hypothesis, I discovered a different way to teach pirouettes to student dancers.

WARM ENOUGH?
Amber Whitney Wray
Gaffney High School, Gaffney & SC, US

There are many different fabrics people use to keep warm. This experiment was designed to determine if laundry treatments would hamper the insulation ability of the fabrics. Four fabrics were used: wool, cotton flannel, fleece, and velour, which are all common outer garment materials.<br><br> A test tube filled with water was used to simulate normal human body temperature. The different fabrics were cut and sewn to fit as a jacket to the test tube. Each jacket was washed with a different type of detergent or otherwise treated, i.e. dry cleaning. The treated jackets were placed around the test tube as an insulator. The insulated "body" was then put into a cold chamber: a block of ice 21 centimeters square and 15 centimeters deep with a hole 26 centimeters in circumference and 10 centimeters in depth. A temperature probe was then inserted into the test tube and temperature reading taken. The measurement used to determine the insulating properties of the various fabrics was the time elapsed between the temperature change of 37 degrees Celsius (normal body temperature) abd 35 degrees Celsius (the beginning of hypothermia).<br><br> The conclusion of this project was that laundry treatments do not have a negative affect on the fabrics' ability to insulate.

AN ANALYSIS OF NETWORK MOTIFS IN THE C. ELEGANS NERVOUS SYSTEM
Eric Paniagua
Massapequa High School, Massapequa, NY 11758, USA

Networks are characterized by local structure. In particular, local structure is especially important in information processing networks. Highly overrepresented structures in a network (those structures appearing more frequently than expected) may represent functional subunits of the network. Local structure is analyzed in the chemical synapse and gap junction networks of the C. elegans nervous system by searching for overrepresented network structures (motifs). To develop statistics for identifying overrepresented motifs and calculating the significance of overrepresentation, random graph ensembles are defined and constructed. Significance p-values for the C. elegans counts are calculated from the resulting numerical distributions of motif counts. These ensembles are constructed so that for statistics on motifs of size n all counts of smaller motifs are kept the same as in the original network. This approach prevents a larger pattern from being overrepresented because it contains a smaller overrepresented motif. A number of overrepresented motifs are identified. In particular, overrepresentation of bidirectionally connected doublets and a triplet called “feed-forward loop” have been previously identified as overrepresented in such diverse networks as E. coli and S. cerevisiae transcription networks and the World Wide Web. These structures may represent fundamental computational units. Further investigation of overrepresented motifs is highly warranted.

PARTICLE DEFLECTION FROM A RADIOACTIVE CO-60 SOURCE: A MATTER OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Jacob Lee Stricherz
South Shore High School, South Shore South Dakota, United States

This experiment tests how many particles from a radioactive cobalt-60 source will be deflected by plastic, aluminum and lead of different area densities. I hypothesized that lead with an area density of 1653 mg/cm^2 would be required to deflect all particles emitted from the cobalt-60 source, also as the area density increases more particles will be deflected. The results display that lead with an area density of 7550 mg/cm^2 deflected approximately half of the particles emitted from the cobalt-60 source. Lead of a higher area density would be required to deflect all particles emitted from the source, however this experiment still displays how the number of particles deflected increases as the area density of the material increases. <br><br> This experiment is the first step to developing a test to detect nuclear material being shipped into the country. If cosmic muons are used to detect nuclear material, sets of two detectors would be required. Using coincidence counting and finding the random coincidence rate will reduce background noise detected. <br><br> The cobalt-60 source used in this experiment emits photons at 1.17 and 1.33 MeV, these particles are relatively week compared to cosmic rays that can be detected. (Cosmic rays travel at 10^9 to 10^18 eV). The materials available in the lab, (plastic, aluminum, and lead) easily deflect photons. In reality cosmic rays would be used to detect the materials and to determine the type of material and its location would take additional tests, and a three dimensional area of detectors surrounding the material. <br><br>

G-LINE POWER TRANSFER
Michael James Bella
Leigh High School, San Jose, California, USA

I think it is possible to use a Tesla coil to transfer energy through a single conductor. My study also investigated the effects of input turns, output turns, and input power on the operation of the circuit. I built a Tesla coil and a resonator to use in a miniature demonstration of the G-line principle. The G-line principal states that a single wire may be used to transport energy across one wire. I found that the principle works, that is to say I got energy out of the project. The output was of substantial potential, which reached into the thousands of volts. My research has never been documented before. Tesla claimed to have done the research on this principal but there is no data available. When Tesla did his work most people did not know much about AC voltages, today more people better understand Alternating Current (AC). It is possible to send electrical current through one wire and it may be possible to send it through the earth as well. If it is possible then it would be advantageous to the human race to utilize this application of the Tesla coil. Tesla coils are not very efficient because some components radiate energy in light and heat, so using a Tesla coil to distribute power would not be particularly advantageous over other means of power distribution.

SEARCHING FOR BALANCED CONDITIONS BETWEEN A COMPUTER SCREEN AND LIGHT AMBIANCE
Shelly Amieva
John B. Alexander High School, Laredo, TX, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what type of computer monitor provides the appropriate illuminance (via light intensity) when combined with other sources of light in the same room.<br><br> A Cathode Ray Tube monitor (CRT), a CRT with a protective shield, and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen were tested. With the lights off, the light intensity of each screen was measured five times from a constant distance with a light probe and a Calculator Based Laboratory (CBL). Another five readings for each monitor were taken with white light, green light, red light, and blue light respectively. After measuring the monitors’ light intensities, data was analyzed with graphs according to ambient light sources. Then an individual average of each light intensity value for each monitor with a different light color ambient was calculated. These averages were converted to lux. Another set of theoretical lux values based on a light atmosphere of 120 watts was derived from the original data. These theoretical calculations were compared to the illuminance levels recommended by the Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.<br><br> The LCD is the best monitor to use in a well-lit environment because its graphs showed the most light intensity uniformity. If a CRT is used then it should be used with a protective shield because this reduces light intensity by about 28% and allows stable periods of light intensity. The theoretical illuminance values for green and white light with all monitors were within the recommended illuminance range. <br><br>

SILVER NANOPARTICLE COATINGS PREPARED BY THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF PVP/AG COMPOSITE
Mingwei Gu
Hoover High School, Hoover, AL, USA

The purpose of the experiment was to explore the optical properties and surface morphology of silver nanoparticle coatings on glass, especially how they are influenced by different periods of thermal exposure and by the number of layers assembled.<br><br> Glass substrates of 0.1mm thickness were ultrasonically cleaned and placed in the center of a vacuum spin-coater. A previously prepared 30mL solution of 2-methoxyethanol with 0.16g AgNO3 and 0.16g poly(vinyl)-N-pyrrolidone (PVP) was used in the experiment. 0.1mL of the solution was dropped onto the surface of the substrate. The spin-coater ran for thirty seconds at 2000rpm. The sample was removed and dried at 100º C. Then, different samples were heated at 400ºC for different time periods: 5 seconds, 30 seconds, and two minutes. Each sample was then removed and cooled. The process was repeated in order to produce samples of two, three, five, seven, nine and ten layers.<br><br> An optical spectroscope was used to measure the absorption due to the surface plasmon resonance in the samples from the wavelengths 300nm to 800nm. It was concluded that as the number of layers increased, the absorption peak shifted toward red. Also, as the number of layers increased, the absorption curve evened out, making the peak a less distinguishing feature. The Atomic Force Microscope was employed to link the results of optical measurements with the size, surface distribution and aggregation of nanoparticles. The particles tend to form a discontinuous layer of silver nanoparticle aggregates.

SAVING NATURAL RESOURCES BY USING A CONSTANT FLOWING WATER CURRENT TO PRODUCE POWER FROM AN UNDERWATER WINDMILL
Randall Clark Shults
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach Fl, USA

Energy is the number one problem facing the world. Underwater windmills, experimental at best, are currently used to convert energy from tidal currents. This project highlights the potential use of harnessing the power of strong ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream. It tests the use of underwater windmills under a range of revolutions/minute, achieved by altering the distance from the water propulsion system to the windmill. The actual power was related to the theoretical power to determine the efficiency. Comparing theoretical power equations found the velocity of the water current necessary to attain and sustain a certain revolutions/minute. The researcher’s turbine was composed of three blades positioned normal to the direction of the water current, a direct application of Bernoulli's principle. Because of the inability of the researcher to waterproof a motor casing, a very significant amount of rotational kinetic energy was lost through friction by way of a drive shaft constructed of legos. This, and the inefficiency of the lego motor run backwards as a generator, resulted in maximum efficiencies less than 1% that related indirectly to the number of revolutions/minute. At a water speed of 2 m/s (the peak velocity of the Gulf Stream), the researcher achieved 9 revolutions/minute rather than the 30 necessary revolutions/minute and .02 watts of the 2.00 watts predicted. The researcher concluded that the results were inconclusive, neither proving nor disproving the possibility of such a system, but highlighted the researcher’s computational successes as well as engineering mistakes and setbacks.

TREBUCHET: ANCIENT DEVICE FOR TEACHING MODERN PHYSICS, PHASE III
Heather Natasha Rogers
Brunswick High School, Brunswick, Georgia, USA

The trebuchet was a medieval siege engine used to capture castles in war. A trebuchet consists of a counterweight, an arm or beam, a sling in which the projectile is placed, and a frame. Trebuchets were extraordinarily accurate and could cast stones of around one hundred to two hundred pounds great distances. A table-sized trebuchet was constructed that can be used to calculate results of experiments that deal with velocity, time traveled, work in, work out, kinetic energy, and efficiency. <br><br> Using six different counterweights (.68kg, 1.13kg, 1.59kg, 2.04kg, 2.50kg, 2.95kg) and three different projectile weights (.03kg, .06kg, .09kg) five tests were conducted. Data was collected on altitude and horizontal distances. Averages were calculated on all results, and the data was entered into formulas to determine the efficiency of the trebuchet.<br><br> By conducting this experiment, the Engineering Goals were supported by the results. The work out was always less than the work in. This is because energy is lost in the process of the launch. After entering the results of all the tests into the formulas, the efficiency could be calculated. The efficiency of the trebuchet was much lower than expected. For example, the efficiency of the trebuchet at projectile weight of .03kg and a counterweight of .68kg was .25.

THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH ON FLOW RATE IN A MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC PUMP
Robert S. Arthur
John Handley High School, Winchester, VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of magnetic field strength on the flow rate produced by a Magnetohydrodynamic pump. I hypothesized that as the strength of the magnetic field was increased, the flow rate would increase as well, showing a direct relationship. A pump apparatus was designed and created using PVC piping, the magnetic field was created using U-shaped electromagnets, and current was generated between two copper electrodes. In testing, current was held constant between the electrodes, while the current running through the electromagnets was varied. Testing was first completed using a water and sodium chloride solution, but was then completed with magnesium sulfate solution to eliminate the formation of Copper (II) Chloride within the pump. To determine the flow rate, dye was injected into the pump and timed over a distance of 15 cm. However, in the second phase of testing, a flapping flow detector was designed, with the angle of deflection proportional to the flow rate. Flow was also analyzed using the Reynolds Number. My conclusions supported my hypothesis to a certain extent. While increased magnetic field strength did increase flow rate, it is possible that the flow rate could reach a certain experimental maximum, eliminating the possibility of a direct relationship. In the future, I plan to test the pump at higher flow rates, possibly reaching this maximum. Also, I plan to determine the efficiency of the pump based on the Lorentz Force Law.

CALCULATING A MATHEMATICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN SEVERAL AERODYNAMIC VALUES AND LEADING EDGE BOUNDARY LAYER SEPARATION
David Amor
MAST Academy, Miami, FL, USA

Boundary layer separation (BLS) on an aircraft wing is a theoretical indicator of decreased lift capability. An Eppler-205 airfoil, known for its aerodynamic versatility and its ability to adapt to differing and even adverse pressure gradients was used as a test bed to develop a mathematical equation describing the relationship between leading edge boundary layer separation and lift coefficient, drag coefficient, total lift and total drag. Two phases of testing were conducted: subsonic wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A unique method of measuring BLS without disrupting the incoming airflow was developed where using coat hanger wire wrapped in coffee filter paper, the green food dye used as flow visualization would strike the paper at the point where delaminating off the airfoil surface occurs. CFD was used to verify the experimental setup and results. After fifty trials, the individual boundary layer separation distances were recorded and a heuristic approach was used in finding an equation relating the different variables. The equation derived is<br><br> S = ((CL^2 + CD) / ((sqrt(L)) + D)) x R<br><br>where S is separation distance, CL is coefficient of lift, CD is coefficient of drag, L is total lift and D is total drag and R is a constant .949486. This work serves as a platform for finding an all-encompassing theorem to describe boundary layer separation effects for all airfoil sections and in turn all aircraft wings. It’s simplicity allows it to be molded to fit different airfoil sections including the more complex NACA digit airfoils.<br><br>

ELECTRIC COLLISION EFFECT BETWEEN POLYSTYRENE PARTICLES AND ELECTROLYTE IN MICRO CONSTRUCTING USING OPTICAL TWEEZER - WHAT HINDERS THE MICRO CONSTRUCTING?
Dong Ho Kim
Busan Science Academy, Baekyang kwanmunro111, jingu, Busan, Republic of Korea

An increasing number of people are putting their efforts in researching in field of life science all around the world. Even more so in bio technology than in many other fields, perhaps, the manipulative techniques of micro particles have an increasingly significant role. Optical tweezer is one of the most essential skills among them. For the past three decades, considerable data has supported claims that the optical tweezer can be applied to many fields. Such findings support that this technique also can be applied to biological particles. The difference between the experiment with polystyrene particles and with biological cells has been observed during my research.<br><br> Electric collision effect, which represents the phenomenon in which a trapped particle bounces out of a potential well due to the crash with other particles, serves as a basis for this study. The effect occurs only in an experiment with polystyrene particles. In the case of trials with biological cells such as yeast or nonconductor such as a latex particle, such observed phenomenon does not occur. I, therefore, assumed that the electrical charge plays a critical role in the phenomenon; such observation lead to a further experiment in a controlled condition. When added NaCl as an electrolyte, it has been observed that the addition takes off the electric collision effect. <br><br> In the case of experiments with electrically charged particles, trapping more than two particles is difficult due to the elective repulsive force between them. Hence, considering electrolyte in order to remove repulsion was needed. When the initial speed of the particle is larger than a specific value, the collision effect has been observed even when the electrolyte had been added. Accordingly, further experimentation will be focused on finding the critical point. The contributions of this project can be quite encompassing: from manipulation of a particle to a complex micro constructing.<br><br>

BROWNIAN MOTORS
Kimberly Paige Farris 
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL, USA

Brownian motion is the random movement of microscopic particles due to constant bombardment by other particles. The second law of thermodynamics states that the energy created by these particles in a thermal bath cannot be converted totally into mechanical work if the particles are in equilibrium. On the other hand, motor proteins are able to generate work against thermal agitation. The purpose of this project is to theoretically investigate motor proteins that harness Brownian motion by applying a “flashing ratchet” model. This Brownian motor mechanism turns proteins into motors. In order to determine if the scenarios simulated are possible in reality, this project studies Brownian motors in relation to muscle contraction, namely, the myosin head’s walk along the actin filament. Through computer simulations, graphs were compiled that ultimately were compared to the movement of actual motor proteins. These graphs indicate that the motor velocity increases with an increase of thermal noise (heat), that motors are capable of operating when external forces are applied, and that the simulated motors strongly resemble the movement of single myosin heads. In conclusion, computer simulations of Brownian motors proved promising as a source of finding a way to build mechanical muscle fibers capable of operating exactly like human muscles. Research applications could include limitless sources of fuel, muscle fibers for robots, and a more accurate knowledge of the human muscular system. <br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) ON MICROELECTRONIC DEVICES
Hena Waseem, Jason David Linehan
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL, U.S.A.

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), like lightning or a zap when touching a metal door knob, occurs in our daily life. ESD is the instantaneous flow of current between objects of opposite electrical potential. The profile of the voltage and current developed during ESD can be harmful to electronic devices. Such devices have many submicroscopic metal conductors which could be damaged by ESD, thereby damaging the device. The cross-sectional area of these conductors, and through which the discharge occurs, has a direct relationship to the ESD breakdown voltage. The larger the area of the metal conductor, the higher the voltage it can tolerate during discharge.<br><br>An experiment was conducted using SAW devices to study this relationship. A SAW device is an electronic device which is used in cell phones. The area of the metal conductors in these devices is inversely proportional to the frequency of operation of the device. Three SAW devices, with area of 4.14 x 10^-13, 1.725 x10^-13, 1.184x10^-13 meters squared and frequencies of 170.6 MHz, 1575.4 MHz and 1821.5 MHz respectively were studied and their ESD breakdown voltage information was obtained. It was found that the higher the area of the metal conductors, the higher the breakdown voltage. Also, due to the physics of the device itself, the higher the frequency, the lower the area and hence the lower the breakdown voltage. The findings of our experiment supported the hypothesis that there is a statistically significant difference between the breakdown voltages due to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) depending upon the area of the conducting metal. <br><br>

ISOLATING AND ENHANCING DESIGN PARAMETERS OF AN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC GENERATOR TO DETERMINE SCALABILITY FOR COMMERCIAL POWER PRODUCTION
Ryan Paul Jones, Eric Anthony Smith
Astronaut High School, Titusville, FL USA

This project explores the possibility of manipulating variables to maximize generator output creating a viable alternative power source. The generator enables the extraction of power through the magnetohydrodynamic process. This unique approach involves multiple salt substances suspended in a high velocity stream, seeded with ions from both a Wimshurst generator and a negative ion generator.Prior to construction, the researchers’ past MHD projects were reviewed and new concepts theorized. The researchers’ project aims to maximize power production by adjusting certain variables deemed the most important.A single cycle apparatus was constructed using PVC pipe and plastic tubing. Six different modules were assembled. The concept requires a high-energy source for ionization of the entrained salt. Research suggested that both a Wimshurst generator and a negative ion generator would provide sufficient high voltage static energy. NaCl, KCl, and Rochelle salts were used for testing. Pre-tests were conducted to assure ideal operation of the apparatus. After analyzing these initial tests, the researchers’ corrected all major problems. The NaCl yielded the greatest average voltage results but the Rochelle Salt proved to be the most consistent.The voltage test results indicated as the velocity and the flow rate increased so did the voltage output. This was verified using the ANOVA statistical program. The data also shows that an increase in cross sectional area of the channel would increase the number of free ions available, yielding higher voltage. This data shows that this generator is scalable for alternative large-scale power production.

Several previously unknown features were found resulting in a completely new experimental theory of solitary wave propagation. Besides we compared solitary waves with capillary and gravity waves, proved their essential difference and thus performed a complete research of the phenomenon.

REFRACTION ACTION HOW IS LIGHT REFRACTION INFLUENCED BY ITS INCIDENCE ANGLE AND ITS MEDIUM?
Whitney Elyse Scott, Lam Dinh Son Pham
Northside High School, Fort Smith, Arkansas, United States of America

Light refraction is an important part of many lens products such as eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes and fiber optics. This research tested whether light’s incidence angle or the medium through which it travels affects light refraction more. It also tested which medium - glass, H2O, corn syrup, vegetable oil, plastic, or plastic wrap – refracts light most. <br><br> This research involved two variables: light refraction influenced by its incidence angle and light refraction influenced by its medium. Two protractors were placed with straight edges facing each other and a medium in between them. Pushpin A was placed at O° of one protractor and Pushpin B was placed on the round edge of that protractor. Then, an observer looked through the medium, lined up the two pins, and placed Pushpin C on the second protractor. Pushpin A and Pushpin B formed the incidence angle. Pushpin C was used to calculate the refraction angle using Snell’s Equation.<br><br> First, the medium stayed constant and the incidence angle was changed. Then, the incidence angle stayed constant and the mediums were changed. Refraction angles were recorded for both parts.<br><br>The incidence angle affected light refraction more because the refraction angle was approximately 40° at 80° incidence; none of the mediums bent light to that great an extent. The medium that bent light the most was glass. At 20° incidence, glass refracted light to approximately 11°, H2O refracted it to 13°, vegetable oil to 14°, corn syrup to 16°, plastic to 16°, and plastic wrap to 18.7°.<br><br>

This project aims to develop a public announcement system so that two languages can be broadcasted simultaneously and the audience can choose their preferred language without using any hearing device. Interference of sound waves is utilized so that the audience can hear one language in some areas and another language in other areas.<br><br> Several speakers were connected together to an audio source of English and the sound waves interfered each other to produce nodal and anti-nodal regions. These speakers were connected in anti-phase to ensure the nodal regions were fixed in certain areas. Similarly, another set of speakers broadcasting Chinese was used to produce nodal and anti-nodal regions. With suitable arrangement, anti-nodal regions of English could be the nodal regions of Chinese and the audience there could hear clear broadcast in English without Chinese disturbance and vice-versa.<br><br> Using sound absorbing foam to avoid reflections, a difference of about 10dB of sound intensity level was recorded in the nodal regions and the anti-nodal regions. The separations of these regions were about 1m. Classmates were invited to listen to the bilingual broadcast directly with their ears and more than 90% of them felt satisfied with the effect.<br><br> With this system, bilingual broadcast is possible in museums, galleries, coaches, aeroplanes, etc. No hearing device is required.<br><br>

ACOUSTO-OPTIC LASER DIFFRACTION IN AN AIR MEDIUM<br><br>Acousto-Optics define the interactions between acoustic waves and light waves. Most interesting is the relationship between the amplitude of the light, the amplitude of the sound, and the properties of the medium through which the two interact. What we wanted to investigate is whether or not it is possible to diffract a laser beam using acoustic waves in an air medium. Our preliminary research found that there was a noticeable effect on the laser from the interaction between the air and the acoustic waves. What we wanted to do is show that it is possible to obtain a measurable diffracted beam using acousto-optic interference. We used an acousto-optic array composed of a piezo acoustic generator positioned at a 90 degree angle to a laser beam. The laser was directed at a target positioned at the opposite end of the chamber from the laser. We then took data with the array turned on, and the array turned off. We determined is that is possible to diffract a measurable laser beam using an acousto-optic array in an air medium.<br><br>

Fishing is one of the major industries in the country. However, the methods used here in the Philippines are quite traditional. Some fishermen sometimes resort to methods that are harmful to the environment to increase their catch such as cyanide fishing, dynamite fishing,and muro ami.<br><br> The researchers thought of using available technological tools today to introduce a new environment-friendly method, an innovative device that would help catch more fish in less time and effort.<br><br> A device that could generate sine waves with different sound frequencies was constructed in order to attract fishes. Sine waves were created using GoldWave version 5.06 software. A device was constructed, tested and debugged, adapting its features to the environment in which the device could be effectively used. It was submerged in bodies of freshwater where fishes are found. Several frequencies were tested ranging from 200 to 2000 Hz. The fishes' response to the various frequencies was observed and recorded.<br><br> Fishes responded to variations in sound frequencies; the number of fishes that was attracted by sine waves differed with varying sound frequencies.After application of the device, results indicates that sine waves with frequencies ranging from 1000 to 1500 Hz attract the most number of fishes.

COUNTERWIEHGT TREBUCHETS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OBJECT, SLING LENGTH, COUNTERWEIGHT MASS, WITH ITS RANGE.
Kyle M. McCracken, Austin D. Cole
Whiteford High School, Ottawa Lake MI, United States

The purpose of this project was to find which variable caused the most controllable change in the distance a projectile could be thrown. Three variables were tested: sling length, the projectile, and the counterweight mass. We think that changing the counterweight mass will directly affect the distance a projectile will go. First, three different objects were tested. We tested a tennis ball, a croquet ball, and a rubber practice baseball. The rubber practice baseball went the farthest. Second, three different counterweight masses were tested, using the tennis ball as the projectile. The more mass the counterweight had, the farther the projectile went. Three different sling lengths were tested last, using a tennis ball as the projectile. The short and the long sling resulted in the same way. Both threw the tennis ball strait into the air with little forward distance. The medium sling length threw the tennis ball the farthest. During the testing, only minor problems occurred. While testing the different objects, the release pin shifted slightly to the right, resulting in the last two tests to be much different that the previous ones. In the end, we found our hypothesis was proven correct. By changing the counterweight mass, we were able to control the distance a projectile went, better than if you change the sling length or the object thrown.

MEDIEVAL PHYSICS: AN EXPLORATION OF THE TREBUCHET
Colin James Dean, Trevor James Register
Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, GA, USA

The problem researched was the relationship between the length of the sling of a trebuchet and the displacement a thrown projectile achieved. The question addressed sought both the ideal length of the sling (the one throwing maximum displacement) and also the relationship (if any) that exists between sling length and displacement of the projectile. The independent variable was the sling length, while the dependent variable was the displacement of the projectile that the sling threw. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the ideal sling length. It was hypothesized that the ideal sling length would be 3.5 feet, and that if short lengths were tested, the projectile would go increasingly further as the sling lengths increased until the ideal sling length was reached, after which the projectile's displacement and consistency would deteriorate. First, a trebuchet was built, and the experiment commenced as follows: starting with a length of 1 foot, the sling was tested and its length increased until the effectiveness seemed fully compromised. The ideal sling length emerged through the trials and after analysis of the data obtained. The ideal sling length was found to be 4.09 feet, meaning the hypothesis was incorrect but not greatly so; the relationship between sling length and displacement was found to be quadratic, proving the earlier part of the hypothesis. New problems identified include the question of the relationship between effective sling length and throwing arm length.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: OPTIMISING WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION INVESTIGATION INTO FACTORS AFFECTING ENERGY OUTPUT.
Laura Kelly McKemmish, Nilrundi Videesha Saparamadu 
Baulkham Hills High School, Sydney NSW, Australia

This project was an investigation into optimising the efficiency of alternative energy production. The study was two-fold, designed both to research the optimal wind turbine design and the effect of the orientation of a solar cell in relation to the sun. Speculation into factors affecting energy output led to the development of the investigation route. Energy production in wind turbines is measured and compared across different blade numbers and proportion dimensions. The effect on energy production in solar cells when continuously aligned at the optimal elevation and azimuth is compared to that of a fixed position and examined in terms of time and cloud cover. <br><br><br>Testing different blade numbers and proportional dimensions on a model produced voltage readings from which optimum arrangements and effects of studied factors were determined. Tests with fixed and tracking solar cells yielded comparative power readings which when considered with cloud cover established, across different time frames, first the quantitative advantage of tracking and second, the adverse influence of clouds on both energy production and net gain of tracking. <br><br><br>Wind turbine results were inconclusive, due to uncontrolled variables with differences in model weight, design difficulties, and dubious changing voltage output from same blade design. However, evidence was obtained that tested factors did influence energy production. Further tests with more sophisticated equipment than available should yield decisive results. The advantage of tracking the sun was confirmed (Averaged, at 4pm, 114.2mW vs 56.2mW). Energy output and net gain of tracking were found to decrease with increasing cloud cover. <br><br>

A SIMPLE ANSWER JUST ISN'T PROBABLE: A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF UNCERTAINTY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEXITY IN CELLULAR AUTOMATA
Michael Wu, Stephanie Stoughton
Shepton High School, Plano Texas, United States

Developing theories state that the uncertainty present in quantum mechanics may have allowed the complex universe to develop from a simple beginning and simple rules. The purpose of this project is to develop a cellular automata computer model to determine if systems governed by some defined amount of uncertainty result in greater complexity than systems with entirely definite rules. <br><br> Cellular automata with the addition of variable that would be uncertain 0-100% of the time, increasing in increments of 10, were run for 1000 generations. Algorithmic Information Theory, a measurement of complexity determined by randomness, was applied to the ending systems by compressing data with an RLE lossless compressor and measuring the average amount of data compressed. Because compression ability is inversely related to randomness, this data could be turned into the quantitative measurement called “complexity factor” (CF). <br><br> In general, complexity increased as uncertainty increased. However, at 0% uncertainty, the average CF, 97.94, was higher than the 10, 20, and 30% trials. Further experiments were conducted of the complexity of systems with uncertainties between 0-10%. This data showed that the unexpected high complexity at 0% was actually part of a trend that decreased between 0 and 5 percent, with a minimum CF of 97.07 at 5% uncertainty. The rest of the data exhibited a general growing trend and reached a maximum CF of 99.99 at 100% uncertainty. This experiment verifies the hypothesis that the addition of significant amounts of probability can cause a system to become more complex.<br><br>

ATTENUATION OF MICROWAVE POWDER FILTERS
Tristan Guha-Gilford, Tara McCarron
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD, 20769

Our project, Attenuation of Microwave Powder Filters, deals with determining a viable filtration system for reducing, if not eliminating, high frequency noise present in an environment containing quantum particles. Many current quantum-computing experiments involve experimentation and examination of quantum particle entanglement. It has been noted that experiments studying the effects of quantum interaction are especially susceptible to failure because outside energy sources can easily disrupt the rather fragile system being observed. To ensure accuracy, an environment must be created for the particles that is isolated from all extraneous energy such as thermal energy and high frequency microwave energy. Therefore, the purpose of our project is to develop a filter that is able to provide a significant reduction in the presence of high frequency noise. <br><br> The filters tested follow a simple, yet effective design. We first create a cylindrical core using metal powder and high-viscosity epoxy. Once hardened, a wire is either coiled around the core or run alongside of it. Either end of the wire is soldered to an SMA jack connector. Once the internal structure is completed, it is then housed inside copper tubing. In the project we tested eight variables in order to determine which factors in the filters’ design were conducive to the superior attenuation of microwave energy. We connected two thermo-coaxial cables to the filter and sent a microwave signal through it. The reflected signal is what we measured the attenuation to be. Through our experimentation we have been able to design an ideal filter for attenuating high frequency noise.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF GAS BUBBLES ON BUOYANT FORCE
Christopher Ryan Hernandez, Jenny Hastings
Thunderbird High School, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America

The purpose of the experiment is to investigate whether bubbles can cause a floating object or vessel to sink. Determining whether or not bubbles can cause objects to sink will determine if methane eruption sites, that emit a great abundance of bubbles, pose a threat to vessels passing over them. <br><br> <br><br> The hypothesis states that if a an object is positively buoyant in a fluid because it is less dense than the fluid, and bubbles were added to the fluid to decrease the density of the resulting mixture, then the positively buoyant object will become negatively buoyant when the bubbles cause the density of the mixture to become less then the density of the object. In the experiment, six balls with different densities were placed into an apparatus with water. Air was injected into an aerator at the bottom of the apparatus to create bubbles. Before injecting air, we took an initial reading of the volume of the water. The amount of air was slowly increased until the ball sank. We measured the volume of the aerated water and found the density of the mixture. <br><br> It was found that the buoyant force on the object is not only dependent on the density of the fluid surrounding the bubbles, but is a result of the density of the water and bubbles combined. It could be concluded that the addition of bubbles into water causes a positively buoyant object to become negatively buoyant. For future research, the experiment should be conducted in an open environment such as an ocean.<br><br>

ARCHITECTURAL ACOUSTICS HOW DOES GEOMETRIC ROOM DESIGN AFFECT THE SOUND FIELD
Mitchell Keith McCowan, Jonathan Mills
East Central High School, Hurley, MS USA

This project is to prove that rooms have different characteristics in sound due to their geometric design; also, different room designs exhibit more reverberant sound build-up than others.<br><br> Procedure materials included computerized measurement program, measurement microphone, and balloon-pop test to record impulse responses of rooms in different locations. Recorded impulse responses at two different locations in each room and were analyzed for acoustic data.<br><br> Impulse responses of gym with highly reflective concrete boundaries show a direct-to-reverberant ratio of 17dB-SPL on floor of gym and 10dB-SPL in the seating area. The reverberant sound energy was much higher in seating than on floor. The fan-shaped sanctuary shows the direct-to-reverberant ratio of 18dB-SPL in seating area of the room. The clarity factor for gym seating area was -4.73 and fan-shaped sanctuary was +8.34. The reverberant decay time for gym was 3.2 seconds, and decay time of sanctuary was 1.5 seconds.<br><br> It’s concluded that all room designs with hard reflective boundaries will cause build-up of reverberant energy in room. Room shapes such as rectangular gym with parallel highly reflective boundaries will excite the reverberant sound field more due to reflection co-efficient of cinderblock walls and hardwood seats, therefore being major cause of destructive interference in speech clarity. Fan-shaped rooms with no parallel walls and padded pews diffract sound, decreasing the reverberant sound level therefore increasing speech clarity. It’s concluded that room design creates the type of reverberant sound field exhibited and the reverberant sound level directly effects the clarity of direct sound field.<br><br>

COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF EXCERCISES JUST DO IT.....THE SAME EVERY TIME
Alicia Renee Andrade, Jacqueline Mooney
Wachusett Regional High School, Holden, MA USA

The main goal of this project was to create a program to analyze an athlete’s movements. Three computer programs were written to satisfy that goal. These programs analyzed data and produced an image to show the athlete how consistently he/she performed a particular movement. <br><br> Athletes were videotaped with a digital camcorder as they performed certain moves. Markers made with electrical tape were applied to the athletes’ clothing to designate certain key joints. These images were put into Avid Express Pro and broken down into individual frames. An exercise program was created in the Visual Basic 6 program to mark the points of movement and write them into a data file. The next program, the Analysis Program, drew the data for two successive trials of the same movement and analyzed the error between the two. A stick figure was created by the program to visually show the move. A third program, the Analysis II Program, went beyond the first analysis program to set the actual image of the move as a backdrop to the stick figure. This provided easy comparisons between trials. The information learned from these programs can be used to help athletes perfect their performances.<br><br> The different moves in both sports (gymnastics and golf) each produced different error readings because some moves were easier to replicate than others. The pushup and the golf stretch had much lower error readings than the bridge and the golf swing, and consequently were more consistent. <br><br>

HOW MUCH SOUND DO YOU ABSORB?
Lane Ward Leishman, Bronzson Woods
Springville Junior High, Springville, Utah, U.S.A.

We took eight people from our families into a reverberation chamber then used an omnidirectional loudspeaker, a microphone, and an analyzer to measure its reverberation time. The test was repeated four times and the results were averaged. We ran similar tests on the empty chamber to determine its base absorption. We then ran three additional tests on ourselves (two people). In the first test, we were fully clothed. In the second test, we wore only swim trunks. In the third test, we wore swim trunks and covered our hair with rubber swim caps. We plugged the average reverberation times into Sabine’s equation to find the total absorption of the people for the different cases. We used the approximate density of humans and a cylinder model to estimate volumes and surface areas of people from their heights and weights. We used an impedance tube and the two-microphone method to measure the absorption of small samples of hair and clothing over frequency. We compared these results to the reverberation chamber results. We found that clothing is the main source of absorption for humans. Hair is somewhat absorptive, but less absorptive than we first thought. Skin is the least absorptive surface and acts somewhat reflectively. We originally thought swim caps over hair would behave like skin, but we found that this was not necessarily true. Higher frequencies are absorbed by humans more efficiently than lower frequencies. Fully clothed humans absorb between 20% of incident sound at lower frequencies and 100% at higher frequencies.

DEVELOPMENT OF A HELIUM NEON LASER BASED OPTICAL SPANNER
Anirudh Venkat Ramesh, Yaagnik Kosuri
Sachem High School East, Farmingville; Herricks High School, New Hyde Park, NY 

Optical tweezing, a technique for trapping particles using Gaussian beams, has been studied for a few decades. A newly emerging field in physics, optical spanners, uses Laguerre Gaussian (LG) beams to not only trap, but to revolve particles. The goals of the experiment were to create a Helium-Neon laser based optical tweezers setup, devise a better way of creating LG beams, and revolve particles. The optical tweezers setup, which used a Helium-Neon laser, was built and aligned. Polystyrene beads were trapped using the Helium-Neon laser’s Gaussian beams. LG beams were created through the use of a forked grating. The power of the laser beam incident upon the forked grating was measured and analyzed. However, due to low efficiency, the single –forked grating was abandoned as the method to create Laguerre Gaussian beams. The creation of a forked grating with multiple forks, which channel the beam’s intensity into one order, was pursued using computer programs such as Mathematica. A comparison of efficiencies of trapping with Laguerre Gaussian beams and Gaussian beams was made. For small particles (<100nm), LG beams were seven times more efficient than Gaussian beams. A mathematical analysis of the relationship between the angular velocity of a trapped particle and the azimuthal order, l, was made. In the future, the multiple forked grating will be perfected and the trapping and spinning of particles will be observed and compared with empirical data. In the future, optical spanner technology will be applied directly to the fields of micro and cell biology.

THE EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE COSMIC RAY DETECTORS
Rudy William Resch, Kent Robert Shirer
Lincoln High School, Lincoln, NE, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to determine the efficiency of photomultiplier tube (PMT) cosmic ray detectors at various points across the surface as a function of the distance from their PMT.<br><br> To find the detector’s efficiency, the following was done. A map of points was created where the efficiency would be tested. Then, the large detectors were placed in a telescope array and the maps were placed on each detector. Next, small detectors were placed above and below the large detectors in a vertical alignment. <br><br> The coincidences between the two small detectors were set as the known cosmic rays that passed through the large detector. A coincidence is when two or more detectors record a common cosmic ray. Also, the coincidences between the large and small detectors were determined. The ratio of these coincidences was the efficiency of the detectors.<br><br> When detector’s PMT was located in the center of the scintillator material, the average efficiencies were 67% and 76%. When detector’s PMT was located at the end of a tapered light guide, the average efficiencies were 95% and 98%. <br><br> We can conclude from this experiment that detectors with a central PMT and no light guide are less efficient than detectors with their PMT located at the end of a light guide. Also, when the PMT was located in the center, the efficiency decreased as a function of the distance from the PMT, which was not solely the case when the PMTs were attached to a light guide.<br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF ZINC ADDITIVE OF THE COMPRESSIVE YIELD STRENGTH OF LEAD
Meghan Kyl Sarkozi, Robert McManimon
Salpointe Catholic High School, Tucson, Az., United States

Our goal was to determine if an amount of Zinc (Zn) additive to Lead (Pb) would increase its overall strength against impact deformity for applied use in bullet manufacturing. We felt that proper mixing could effectively distribute Zn evenly thus increasing overall strength. Laboratory grade Pb was mixed with Reagent grade Zn to create 3 groups separated in terms of percentage by weight. Group 1 contained 0% Zn; Group 2: 20% and group 3: 50%. Samples were brought to a melting point of 450° C then mixed and cast into a graphite mold and allowed to cool. Samples were then machined to an approximate height of .7inches and face area of .13in²; then subjected to compression test capable of exerting 1000lbs of pressure. Group 2 was overall less effective than group 1, however group 3 (with the highest concentration of Zn) was much more effective yielding a mean net gain of 4826.67Psi over Pb. The equation for the increase in terms of compression yield strength means was y=3776.5x2-13243x+16559. This suggests that the Zn weakened the Lead (Pb) to a point, and then strengthened it dramatically. Further testing is required to determine the optimum percentage of additive however, our hypothesis proved correct. Possible, future corrections would include a controlled level of mixture post-melting to determine if it was an extraneous variable.

Our primary purpose in this project is to make a fundus camera to help the diagnosis of blindness causal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. As early diagnosis is the key to treat these diseases, a small and inexpensive camera without the need of a specialist would be a great improvement for medicine. Our second purpose is to show that our camera and fundus vessel’s biometrics can be used together with an image processing algorithm as a security system. This system would be as convenient as other biometry based systems with approximately same price.<br><br> In order to obtain fundus images we illuminated fundus by using the principle to send light in the same axis we intend to take the image. To achieve this goal, we used many optical instruments such as mirrors, lenses, beam splitters, specially designed prisms which are brought together in the most efficient manner.<br><br> We studied the applicability of some diagnosis and identification algorithms designed by ourselves and some other researchers on fundus images.<br><br> We may conclude that, with proper technical substructure and enough time, a superior security system with the ability to warn against diseases can be constructed.<br><br>

NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF HAMILTON'S EQUATIONS
Francis Wasser, Michael Mulhall
Synge Street CBS, Dublin, Ireland

In a paper in the American Journal of Physics (December 1986), Daniel Stump argued that the numerical solution of the equations of motion of a mechanical system is simplest in the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics, since Hamilton’s equations are first-order partial differential equations, and that the fourth order Runge-Kutta method is ideally suited to their solution. <br><br> In this project a new numerical method of solving Hamilton’s equations is proposed and tested. <br><br> In many mechanical systems a conservation law such as conservation of energy or angular momentum may hold. It is common practice to use the conservation law as a check on the accuracy of the simulation. What is new about the algorithm described in this project is that the conservation law is incorporated into the solution process itself, combining the information contained in the conservation law with Hamilton’s equations to calculate the new values of the generalised co-ordinates and momenta. <br><br> The position, momentum and energy errors of simulations of various mechanical systems have been analysed. The accuracy of these simulations was tested in two ways. In some simple systems the output of the new algorithm can be compared to the analytical solution. Where the problem is very complex and an analytical solution is not available the output is compared to that of the Runge-Kutta method. <br><br>

Additionally, they keep on actuating and actuating and….<br><br>Four NiTi springs were shape set at temperatures of 475 C, 525 C, 575 C, and 625 C. They were subjected to cycles of heating and cooling to determine the effects of thermal cycling on SMA wire. The control and the 625 C cycled wires were analyzed using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to determine effects on microstructure. A Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) was used to determine transformation temperatures of all the NiTi samples.<br><br>The DSC graphs showed an increase in martensite and austenite temperatures as heat treatment temperatures increased. After cycling, the graphs showed a decrease in austenite and martensite temperatures. The R-phase was eliminated at the 575 C and 625 C heat treatment temperatures until after cycling. The gap between martensite and R-phase decreased at higher heat treatment temperatures. Also, the undercooling needed to form R-phase increased at higher heat treatment temperatures. The TEM images show a change in twinning, and reoriented variant boundaries. <br><br> <br><br>There is a connection between macroscopic behavior and the atomic scale phenomenology. The ability to tailor transformation temperatures using heat treatments will allow SMAs to become a safer and more reliable source for actuation. This source of actuation can be applied in medical and industrial fields.<br><br>

A COMPACT APPROACH FOR THE 3D LOCALIZATION OF SOUNDS
David S. Holz
Monarch High School, Coconut Creek, Florida, US

The purpose of this project is threefold. Foremost is to create a system to find the origins of sounds in three-dimensional space. Second, is to do it in real time, using minimal equipment, budgets and setups. Lastly, is to enable the capability to locate and track simultaneous sounds. The researcher hypothesized that all of these objectives could be completed by use of a four-microphone array arranged in a known configuration. This array, when fed through a digital processor, would be able to determine the order and times in which each sound reaches each microphone. With this data, it would be possible to then determine the origin of the sound. Various types of equipment were tested, and minimum standards established. A final setup was chosen and a prototype was built. This prototype was then tested for accuracy at varying distances and angles. It was found that the microphone arrangement chosen created an irregular field of blind spots, but outside these fields the locations were consistently accurate to at least 94%. With the data gained from testing, several physical modifications and software optimizations may be made to significantly increase the model’s effectiveness. Although there will always be inefficient areas when using four microphones, testing confirmed that these zones can be simulated, minimized and placed within predicted areas. Once further developed, this model’s capabilities may be able to far exceed that of directional localization devices, which are used in everything from surveillance to office meetings to gunshot recognition systems.

VORTEX AVALANCHES IN SUPERCONDUCTORS
Adam Janecka
Mendelovo gymnázium, Opava, Moravskoslezský kraj, Czech Republic

The ongoing research in superconductivity is probably one of the most interesting topics of present physics. Of the most interest for practice are type II superconductors, characterized by two critical inductions, Bc1 and Bc2. In the intermediate, mixed state, Bc1 < B < Bc2, magnetic flux starts to penetrate the sample in form of vortices. The relatively low activation energy in high-Tc compounds and mutual vortex interaction cause that a jump of an individual vortex or a few of them can activate their neighbours and cause finally an avelanche-like dynamics in the vortex lattice, a jump of 50 – 10000 vortices from one place to another at the same time. The aim of this project is to confirm the existence of these avalanches in MgB2. <br><br>I performed magnetic measurements on an MgB2 sample (with critical temperature of 39K) using SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Charles University in Prague. <br><br>From the experimental data I was able to conclude on the presence of vortex avalanches. Assuming some reasonable conditions for the vortex avalanches, I could predict the approximate “size” of them. These results can be used as a theoretical instruction and can also be compared with the magneto-optical measurement. <br><br>

HOW DOES THE AMOUNT OF POWDER IN A BULLET AFFECT THE AVERAGE VELOCITY?
John RF Kelly
Loveland High School, Loveland, Colorado, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of different amounts of powder on the velocity of the bullet in a common cartridge. Using the 38 Special, the weight of powder in the cartridge was varied over a known-safe range of powder loads. All cartridges used the same primer type, the same bullet weight and type, and were loaded with Alliant Hercules “Unique” powder from the same manufacturing lot. The velocity of each bullet was determined by firing the cartridges through an optical chronograph. The optical chronograph measures the velocity of the bullet by sensing the shadow of the bullet as it passes over the sensors. Control (factory-loaded) cartridges were fired and measured before and after the test cartridges to determine that the measurement equipment had not changed during the testing. The velocity of each bullet was recorded and entered into a spreadsheet program. The data, originally measured using English system units, were converted to metric system units for analysis. Bullet velocity and energy per grain of powder was calculated. While velocity per grain of powder decreased slightly with larger loads, the energy per grain of powder actually increased, indicating more efficient use of the chemical energy in the powder with higher powder loads.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF "MPEMBA EFFECT" -WHY HOT WATER FREEZES FASTER THAN COLD WATER?
Shen Li
Jilin Provincial Experimental Middle School,Changchun,Jilin,CHINA

To explicate the abnormal phenomenon that hot water freezes faster than cold water, this paper proposes A Model Hypothesis of Liquid Heat Transmission through Elastic Collision. <br><br>To demonstrate this hypothesis, five experiments, namely, the Cooling Experiment of Hot and Cold Water, the Accuracy and Precision Experiment, the Inverse Process Heating Experiment, the Feasibility Experiment of Substituting Dissolved Gases with Alcohol and the Cooling Experiment of Equivalent Substitution of Dissolved Gases with Alcohol are designed and conducted. <br><br>These experiments indicate that the temperature of cold water both drops and rises more slowly than that of hot water, that the temperature of water with alcohol molecules rises more slowly than that of water without alcohol molecules, and that the temperature of water with more alcohol molecules drops more slowly, too. This proves the conjecture that big molecules slow down the heat conduction of water and concludes that dissolved gases may be quite an important factor affecting the speed of heat conduction of water. <br><br>A new idea is thus put forward that water at 4 degrees Centigrade experiences a "phase transformation" quite like that of freezing at 0 degree Centigrade. <br><br>Finally, this new hypothesis is employed to explain the five abnormal phenomena newly-discovered in the experiments.<br><br>

SMALL MASS MEASUREMENTS FROM OSCILLATIONS IN A MAGNETIC SUSPENSION FIELD
Carl Louis Rodriguez
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, United States of America

Current methods of mass measurement involve the use of gravimetric forces to depress a plate (E.G. balances, scales). While effective, most centigram scales run from $200-$800. This research discusses cheaper means of mass determination. Previous work by this researcher yielded a device capable of suspending a small paramagnetic sample between two points in midair using electromagnets. The magnet was attached to a feedback amplification circuit, using a phototransistor as the trigger. A laser beam aimed across the bottom pole of the electromagnet hit the phototransistor and acted as a switch. When the beam was uninterrupted, the switch was on, and current flowed through the coil, activating the magnet. When the beam was blocked, the switch was off, and the magnet was deactivated. Thus, when a sample was placed under the electromagnet, it was pulled upward until it blocked the laser beam, deactivating the magnet, and allowing gravity to pull the sample downward again. The sample oscillated between the on and off positions just below the beam. It was theorized that a heavier sample would mean a greater inertial resistance to this oscillation, reducing the oscillatory frequency. To test this theory, weights were attached to a sample in controlled increments, and a frequency counter was installed in the device. Using the oscillatory frequency of several weighted samples, a formula was derived that allowed the mass of the sample to be determined accurately to the hundredth of a gram using the frequency. The total cost of the device was 80$, making it $120 cheaper than products currently on the market.

VISION AID: A NEW HORIZON FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Ricardo Wagner Melero
Fundacao Liberato , Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil

Monocular aid is of huge importance for the insertion of the visually impaired in the society. It is a device that allows distant objects to be viewed as if they were much brighter and closer to the observer, providing the visually impaired the opportunity to frequent the regular school and to be independent in the streets by reading signboards. <br><br>The particularity of my prototype is that, by using the principles of the Galileo Galilee telescope it’s constructed to take care of the visual necessities of each individual, considering that the ones that exist in the market are standardized. Which makes them difficult for adaptation. <br><br>By lowering the cost, I had constructed an accessible aid for a larger number of people.<br><br>Comparing to the existing aids, that costs 700 dollars, my expenses had confined to 15-20 dollars. Such relation between the adaptation and the price is unique.<br><br>Aiming at facilitating reading, writing and mainly the position, I also constructed an ergonomic support, with no similar product on the market. It is simple but vital for the standing position of the visually impaired, that has to bend his spine to read and write on the regular classes.<br><br>Both of my prototypes were tested and approved by visually impaired and professionals of the area. My vision aid is providing the insertion of many persons in the regular school, in the work market and in society in general.<br><br>My hypothesis was confirmed, improving scientifically the quality of life of the visually impaired.<br><br>

PROPELLANTLESS PROPULSION: THE ROLE OF DRIFT TRANSPORT IN ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITOR THRUST PRODUCTION
Stephen Jerome Trettel
New Prague Senior High School, New Prague, Minnesota, United States

The propulsive force produced by specialized high voltage capacitors was first discovered in the 1920's, however a reasonable physical mechanism to explain it has not yet been identified. The objective of this research was to provide reliable scientific data on this effect that will narrow the search for the underlying physical mechanism at work.<br><br>The experiment concerned the effect of geometrically dissimilar electrodes, dielectric gap spacing, and polarity on the magnitude of the net force produced. It was hypothesized that thrust would be proportional to the asymmetry between the electrodes and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Thrust was speculated to be in the direction of the positive electrode.<br><br>Electrode configurations of varying surface areas and dielectric gaps were constructed. The configurations were placed on an electric balance, which measured the resulting force as an increase/decrease in the weight displayed when they were energized. The data from all configurations were then analyzed for patterns and compared to drift transport theories.<br><br>The experimental results confirmed the hypothesis regarding electrode geometry and proximity, and were in general agreement with the ion theories to which they were compared. However thrust was found to be in the direction of the smaller electrode, regardless of polarity. <br><br>This technology has great potential in miniature propulsive applications, due to the fact that it moves silently, and without moving parts. The basic research conducted in experiments such as these bring this technology closer to aerospace application.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF WAVELENGTH ON THE PHOTO-ASSISTED GROWTH OF C60 WHISKERS IN A LIQUID-LIQUID INTERFACE
Tianyuan Wang
duPont Manual, Louisville, KY, USA

Recently, the C60 fullerenes and their derivatives have been a subject of great interest in the fields of chemistry, physics, and material science. This project investigated a novel approach to synthesize C60 whiskers at the interface of a binary solution of C60 dissolved in toluene and isopropyl alcohol. Specifically, this project examined the effects of the wavelength and intensity of light on this growth process. The experiment was conducted by growing several samples of C60 whiskers under different wavelengths and intensities of light using liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation. After growth, the samples were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). An UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of both the binary solution and the C60 toluene solution was also performed. It was found that the growth of the longest whiskers would occur at the absorption peaks of the solutions. It was revealed for the first time that wavelength plays an important role in the length of whiskers grown. The greatest growth occurred in the 320-420 nm region of the spectrum and an examination of the absorption spectrum of the C60 solution revealed a peak at approximately 350 nm corresponds to this high growth. The results also suggested that intensity directly contributes to the growth of longer whiskers and changing absorption levels at the interface also play major roles in the growth process and allow for many opportunities for investigation in future extensions.

A POOR MAN'S WAY OF "HEARING" APART COKE AND ROOT BEER
Kuan-Hao Chen
Hong-Wen Senior High School,Taichung,Taiwan

Tapping the side of a glass of Coke generates a pitch which increases as bubbles escape from the fluid. But the opposite is true when Root Beer is used instead. This rules out an earlier theory claiming that the pitch change is caused by the lowering of the average sound speed in the bubbly liquid. Systematically performing a series of experiments, I showed that the pitch actually increased when bubbles were in the bulk fluid; but it decreases when the bubbles are collected to form a foam on the surface of the drink. Thus, it is the difference in the two competing factors that tell Coke and Root Beer apart in the experiment. A simplified theoretical explanation is also proposed to account for the observed effects.

CARTESIAN DIVER, INTERFACIAL PHENOMENA, AND THE CHEERIOS EFFECT
Sung-Kai Kao
National Chia-Yi Senior High School, Chia-Yi City, Taiwan , R.O.C.

A Cartesian diver is used to study the liquid-solid-air interfacial phenomena. We found that the surface tension of the liquid can be related to the two critical pressures, at which the diver is about to sink and about to emerge. Frequently, the measured surface tension is within 1 % that of the well-recognized value, demonstrating that Cartesian diver is a simple, trustable, and inexpensive classroom apparatus for surface tension study.<br><br>In the critical regime of sinking, a capillary wave, consisting of progressively shrinking rings, may be created. The number of rings was found to increase with increasing sinking depth. We believed that this phenomenon is created by the competitions among the solid-liquid interfacial dragging force, the surface tension of the liquid, and the pressure gradient.<br><br>On sinking by increasing vessel pressure, the diver moves to the center due to the appearance of repulsive forces between the diver and the vessel wall, which drives the system into an equilibrium state, prior to forming the capillary wave. On reducing pressure the diver moves to side, due to attractive forces which were created as the contact angle between the diver and the liquid, less than 90 degree. These phenomena are known as the Cheerios effect. Apparently, the Cheerios effect can be distinguished into a repulsive and attractive phases. We found that it is ease to reveal the two phases of the Cheerios effect by changing the external pressure of the vessel.<br><br>

HAWKING RADIATION AND DARK MATTER
Ian Miles Winson
The King's School Robin Hills, Johannesburg, South Africa

In this research I show the basic properties of Dark Matter and build on them. It is possible to show how Dark Matter is fundamental to many crucial processes in physics including Hawking Radiation, the Information Paradox, Black Body Radiation and a new process which I propose as a result of this research – Information Inheritance and Dictation through the higher dimensions. Several sections of this research (the Information Paradox, Hawking Radiation and Black Body Radiation) concentrate and operate in either four or five dimensional space-time. The five dimensional space-time being the Randall-Sundrum model proposing one detached membrane. The sections of Information Inheritance and Dictation as well as the proposed unification of the fundamental forces and an underlying quantum reality concentrate and operate in the eleven dimensions of M-Theory. Parts of this theory require mathematics which, as yet, remains undiscovered and undeveloped; however, suggestions are given regarding the mathematics. Once the necessary mathematics has been developed this theory will allow for calculations regarding the laws of physics governing the other higher dimensions, extensions of the laws of physics which govern space-time (whether four or five dimensional does not apply), new insight into the structure of the fundamental particles and forces as well as the true quantum realm. This theory also proposes the Dark Origin Paradox which shows approximately when Dark Matter became crucial and fundamental in space-time and the other higher dimensions.

SYNTHETIC DEPTH OF FOCUS
Holly Kristine Zelnio
Chaminade Julienne High School, Dayton, OH, USA

The purpose of this project was to find out whether the depth of focus effect, of a large diameter lens of diameter d, could be synthesized by a camera "flying" a circular path of diameter d. The measurements involved using both a camera simulation and real camera to collect a series of images on a circular path, register the images, and sum the images to "synthesize" a lens with a much larger diameter. After deriving the depth of focus equations to relate the two geometries, the measurements confirmed that the synthetic depth of focus followed the theory as hypothesized. It was discovered and confirmed via experimentation that the depth of focus effect did not require a circular camera path thus significantly broadening the potential applications that can benefit from the findings of this project.

CHAOS FROM ORDER-ORDER FROM CHAOS: CAN THERE BE A WAY OF CONTAINING CHAOS IN TOKAMAKS?
Esther Oluchukwu Uduehi
Francis Joseph Reitz High School, Evansville, IN, USA

Though the tokamak is a great energy producer, it has its problems. When the magnetic fields are not perfect, perturbations occur. The problems I focused on were how to contain chaos. This was done by using a symplectic map to discover a way to solve the problem of chaos in tokamaks. By adding the term of order to the generating function, it is possible to implement barriers inside chaos, reducing the transport of field lines. I used Compaq Visual Fortran to solve the map equations, and Tecplot 9.2 to graph the results, thus simulating the conditions inside tokamaks to find places where chaos occurs and ways to solve this dilemma. The symplectic map consists of the poloidal flux, , the generating function for the map, the toroidal flux, , the action, and the poloidal angle, , which is the angle. Then, I applied the magnetic perturbations (m,n)={(3,2),(2,1)}, each with the same amplitude . To solve the problem of chaos, I created barriers through the addition of a term of order to the generating function. the addtion of this barrier was usually at psi=0.35. The stability of the barrier ends at 0.00088 and 0.00089, but perturbations lesser than these values are prominent in most tokamaks. The addition of this term can transform chaos at the barrier location into a good magnetic surface that is impermeable to surrounding field lines, preventing chaos on one side of the barrier from crossing to the other side. This invariant torus inside the chaos can help reduce transport in tokamaks.

CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE SURREPTITIOUS READABILITY OF RFID-ENABLED PASSPORTS
Devon Daniel Smith Kibby
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, Alaska, USA

United States passports will soon include radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders which will hold sensitive data, operate at 13.56 MHz, and be designed around the ISO 14443 standard. The passport booklets will be shielded and are intended to be read from no more than 10 cm. Although tags that conform to ISO 14443 are meant to be read from less than 10 cm, if tags are not shielded, read ranges of over 50 cm are possible.<br><br>Read range can be limited by disconnecting or detuning the antenna. To measure the effectiveness of shielding on the readability of RFID-enabled passports at varying angles of opening, cardstock booklets were inlayed with a metal layer and a ferrite layer. The metal layer detuned the transponder antenna when the booklet was closed and the ferrite layer retuned the antenna when opened. An oscilloscope was then attached to the antenna leads and the signal strength from a low power 13.56 MHz reader was measured. Three booklets were tested: unshielded, shielded with aluminum and ferrite, and shielded with 1/16" copper plate and a thicker ferrite. Shielded setups showed dramatically decreased voltages in the flux pipe (tag antenna). Unshielded tags showed a peak of 1842 mV at 70° while aluminum and copper shielded booklets showed peak voltages around 70° of 178 mV and 83 mV respectively. When the shielded booklets were closed neither were readable.<br><br>Whether new RFID-enabled passports use antenna detuning methods or electronic switching or both they will be integral in protecting sensitive passport data.

COIL GUNNERY
John Robert Krause
Centreville High School, Centreville Virginia, USA

The Purpose of this experiment was to judge the potential effectiveness of solenoid based electromagnetic accelerators "Coil guns" for use in fields such as space exploration or other areas where very high potential speeds may be required, and to find the effect that projectile length has on the efficiency of a Coil Gun. The experiment was conducted first by building a functioning prototype Coilgun, which ran off of 2 paralleled 200 volt 390 microfarad capacitors. These were hooked to a silicon-controlled rectifier to allow for high-current solid state (non-mechanical) switching. Projectiles where created by cutting sections of a steel rod at 3 different sizes. Each were then fired from the coil multiple times and their exit velocity was measured by using a microphone to record the sound of the fire switch being pressed and the corresponding sound of the projectile impacting an object one meter away. The velocity (in m/s) was then used with the mass of each projectile to work out the amount of kinetic energy achieved by the projectile. This was figured out in joules with the equation: .5*(veloctiy^2)*mass, this was then compared to the potential energy of the capacitors, which was calculated in joules with the equation: .5*(voltage^2)*capacitance. The best efficiency achieved was just around 2.6%, which is mostly do to heating of the coils and wasted magnetic fields that form around of coil. The hypothesis was that, the smallest projectile would have the highest efficiency, however after conducting the tests with this setup I found that the medium sized projectile seemed to work the best out of the 3 tested. The smallest projectile ended up with the worst efficiency of the 3, while the biggest came in a far 2nd. If more data was corrected I believe that a bell-curve style graph of size vs. efficiency would be created, with a second bell-curve (but slightly off-set) shaped graph for size vs. velocity, with the medium size being the peak.

DETECTION OF METAL FATIGUE AND DEFECTS BY ELECTRON WORK FUNCTION TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADIENT
Geoffrey Hubert Woo
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, USA

This paper explores the relationship between electron work function (EWF) gradient and metal fatigue and defects. Although multiple techniques have been developed for non-destructive evaluation of a material, no effective real-time method to actively detect and monitor the effects of defects and fatigue on a material currently exists. This study observes novel phenomena with implications for an original non-destructive, non-contact, real-time metal monitoring method. This study also proposes a parallel dislocation mechanism for both exo-electron emission of metals and deformation luminescence of ionic crystals, which was studied previously, in material fatigue and defect analysis. Because low-energy exo-electrons dissipate quickly in the atmosphere, the Kelvin method, which measures the work function gradient, was utilized to measure the increased surface electric potential resulting from exo-electron emission. Using compressive and three-point bending tests on hardened aluminum, the EWF gradient was found to be (1) a clear real-time indicator for metal fatigue, (2) a real-time monitor tracking a metal’s progressive deterioration induced by cyclical load, and (3) useful for determining stress/strain levels through derived mathematical modeling. EWF topographies, taken from a Kelvin probe mounted on a three-dimensional stage, were found to be effective in (1) identifying and pinpointing the locations of both surface and internal flaws, and (2) visualizing the stress distributions of a metal under load. These findings may lead to safer use of vehicles, machines, and structures.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN INEXPENSIVE RAMAN SYSTEM AND A LITTROW SPECTROGRAPH
Mary Masterman
Westmoore High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA

Previously a low-resolution, classical spectrograph with a resolution of about 700 and a spectral range of about 200 nm was constructed. <br><br> For vibrational spectroscopy, a Raman system was built for the above spectrograph. It used a green 532 nm laser to stimulate Stokes scattering in samples. The laser beam was reflected off a dichroic mirror at an angle of 90°. A microscope objective then focused the laser beam onto the sample and collimated the returning light. Light of the laser wavelength was filtered out by an interference filter which reduced the laser signal by approximately 10^5. A 50 mm f.l. lens then focused the waveshifted light on the entrance slit of the spectrograph. Measured wavenumbers correlated well to those in published spectra. Difficulties included false spectral lines created by the multimode laser and flourescence in many samples.<br><br> A Littrow spectrograph was then constructed. A medium-format 200 mm lens was used as a combined collimation and camera lens. A body, utilizing a diagonal mirror, connected the lens with the camera. The modular design facilitated interchanging of the lens, camera, and grating holder with different models. An adjustable slit was created, with light entering through a standard SCT-thread adapter. The spectrograph could be mounted directly to the Raman head or used in other applications, including astronomy. The F/4.8 spectrograph had a resolution of 6650 and a spectral range of 58 nm with a 1200 l/mm grating. The spectrograph was tested with a consumer DSLR camera as well as a cooled CCD camera.<br><br>

EFFECT OF POMERON EXCHANGE IN SOFT AND HARD DIFFRACTION IN QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS
Jared Max Lafer
The Beacon School, New York, NY, United States

Proton-antiproton collisions were studied at different values of particles’ exchanged momentum (Q2) with the goal of comparing soft and hard diffraction, or nonperturbative and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Physics constantly seeks to simplify and unite, and in doing so, it was hoped to find a connection between these two totally different areas of high-energy physics. For this comparison, the particle of Regge Theory known as the Pomeron was used, which transfers the momentum between proton and antiproton during all collisions. All data was collected from a particle accelerator that drives high-energy collisions at 1.96 TeV. This analysis entailed the selection of events through their kinematical properties, and most importantly the study of the effect of the Pomeron exchange through the square of the four-momentum transfer of the particle (t). Measurements showed that the slopes of t-distributions at Q2 values in the range of 0 and 4500 GeV2 were equal within uncertainties, suggesting that the Pomeron exchange has an equal effect in both soft and hard interactions, or in nonperturbative and perturbative QCD. Such an extraordinary connection in turn implies that there might be a natural universality in hadronic collisions.

ANGULAR TRANSFER DYNAMICS OF A MOMENTUM EXCHANGE/ELECTRODYNAMIC-REBOOST (MXER), SPACE TETHER
Adam Matthew Fuhrmann
Heritage Highschool, Leesburg VA, USA

Could space tether technology be used to send satellites into higher orbit like a large game of crack the whip? The purpose of this experiment was to determine if a momentum-transfer space tether system is capable of sending a satellite from a lower-earth orbit (LEO) to a geo-transfer orbit (GTO). This transfer of momentum was determined based on tests conducted with a model tether on a low friction, 2-dimensional, ice surface. The tests, which focused on simulating the system's angular operation, were captured on video and imported onto the computer where (x,y) coordinates of the system for each frame were determined and used to calculate changes in the angular velocity of the tether and linear velocity of the satellite over time. <br><br>Based on these calculations, a graph of the angular momentum of the tether over time was determined using: the length, weight, and angular velocity. This graph showed that, at capture, the rotating tether system transferred 16.8% of its angular momentum to the payload causing its linear velocity to increase in the orbital direction. Based upon the conceptual data, being the control, the system needs a minimum transfer of 10% of its angular momentum to the satellite for it to reach GTO. The experimental system exceeded the necessary transfer of momentum resulting in a correct hypothesis, which was verified by the error analysis, showing that even with a possible 14% test error, the system still exceeds the necessary percent of momentum transfer. This conclusion illustrates the possibility of the system being applied to current space objectives.<br><br>

Developing efficient and inexpensive means to convert a renewable energy source into useful forms could release our society of its dependence on fossil fuels. Commercial Silicon cells which harness solar energy are efficient, but expensive. Here, I explore the electron transfer and excitation processes in an inexpensive dye-sensitized solar cell to improve its design, with the purpose of increasing voltage output in response to natural sunlight.<br><br>Following an existing design, the cell was made by sandwiching a fruit dye, a wide bandgap oxide (originally Titanium Dioxide TiO2) and iodide electrolyte between two conductive glass plates, one of which was coated with carbon catalyst. Current runs through an external circuit when light strikes the dye. The TiO2 cell responded well under low light intensity, which has implications for light detection.<br><br>TiO2 was replaced with other wide-bandgap oxides and combinations of dyes. Zinc Oxide (ZnO) complexed with raspberry showed a voltage output of several hundred millivolts in natural sunlight, comparable with commercial Silicon cells. Under similar conditions, the original TiO2 cell yielded voltage in microvolts. Interestingly, unlike TiO2 cells, the ZnO cells held charge for up to 10 minutes after the light source was removed. Measurements of the absorption spectrum indicated differences in band gap properties of the oxides and the oxide-dye complexes. Further studies of the band gap and the nature of modification of the valence bands are in progress. <br><br>The improved efficiency, storage of energy and use of cheap, eco-friendly materials promises to make this a viable technology.<br><br>

LASER PHOTONICS ACTIVATED ROBOTIC HAND
Lydia Arnold
Audenshaw School, Tameside, Manchester, United Kingdom

The purpose was to design and construct a low power Laser Photonics based Project that incorporated a viable medical application. The potential opportunities were investigated for creating the movement of the digits of a Robotic Hand that might be activated by the finger and thumb movements of an operator’s own hand. The unique characteristic of Laser beam is that of its coherence. One direct consequence of this phenomenon is the emergence of Objective Laser Speckle effects whenever such a beam is scattered. Laboratory investigations revealed that a Laser beam within a multimode polymer optic fibre was sufficiently scattered to produce an appropriate Laser Speckle Pattern that could be altered in its distinctive format by the bending of the optic fibre. It was proposed to detect that changing Objective Laser Speckle Pattern within optic fibres attached to the operator’s digits, and then to process such operator’s digit movement information, through a logic brain, to a translation of the movement of the Robotic Hand digits. Modified, and fully rotational, servo motors attached to springs within the robotic digits produced the motive power for the Robotic digits. The differential sequence of closing, or opening, of the operator’s digits necessitated the design of a special optoelectronic direction sensor. The final design and construction of the Robotic Hand, together with its Laser Photonics and optoelectronic circuits, were assembled as shown in the Display Project. The finished Robotic Hand digits can be opened or closed remotely by the appropriate movement of the operator’s digits. <br><br>

CRACKING THE BRAZIL NUT EFFECT
Meredith Ann MacGregor
Fairview High School, Boulder, Colorado, USA

Vigorous shaking of a container holding a granular material will cause the components to separate by size, the largest particles rising to the top and the smallest sinking to the bottom. A home-built, computer-controlled electromagnetic shaker was used to perform experiments to investigate the connection between this behavior (the "Brazil nut effect") and the convection that occurs in a vibrated granular sample. With strong frictional coupling between the container walls and granules, the convective circulation moves rapidly down to the bottom in narrow lanes along the sides, and slowly returns to the top in a broad, central upflow. The time required for a large "intruder" placed in this flow to travel from the container bottom to the surface was found to depend on the intruder's density, a puzzling property if convection alone produces the BNE. For all the materials used, intruders with densities between about 0.4 and 0.6 times the density of the granules<br><br>had the longest rise times; increasing or decreasing the intruder density outside this range causes rise times to decrease. Measurements show that the intruder with the longest rise time moves upward at the granular convection speed, and that the (heaviest) intruder with the shortest rise time moves faster than the convective flow. Observations of the BNE in a partially evacuated container indicate that the intruders that rise most slowly under normal atmospheric conditions, speed up when the pressure is reduced, implying that air pressure is also involved in the size separation process.<br><br>

The research project is aimed at investigating diffusion transfer processes in the inhomogeneous mediums. The main idea is to apply random-walk method, realized by means of worked out computer code. It enables to model a diffusion process having various restrictions (complex borders, inclusions etc.). Random-walks procedure on a plane and three-dimensional lattice was used, where a part of nodes was accepted as impervious to a random-walks particle.<br><br>The method was applied to calculate concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion coefficient in carbonaceous types of steel, containing pearlite colonies. As a result of modeling, a well-known empirical dependence in metallurgy was managed to have been received: exponential decrease of hydrogen diffusion coefficient in carbonaceous types of steel while carbon concentration in steel increases.<br><br>One of diffusion processes is thermal-conductivity. Experimental part of the research was investigation of thermal-conductivity coefficient of air in school laboratory conditions. The base methodical problem was to suppress convectional heat-exchange influence. This problem was solved by means of vertical AT gradient and engineered attachments. With the help of the worked out device the air thermal-conductivity was found to be 0,032 ± 0,004 W/(m*K) at 320 K and its increase to 0,085 ± 0,012 W/(m*K) at 570 K.<br><br>The contributions of the project are twofold. Firstly, the worked out computer code is simple, applicable to diffusion calculation of any inhomogeneous mediums with high reliability of results. Secondly, the experimental method was created to measure thermal-conductivity coeff of gases. The obtained results agree closely with the well-known data.

WHERE UNDER THE SUN ARE YOU?
Sarah Lynn McCuskee
Campbell Collegiate, Regina SK, Canada

It was suspected that solar wind and the ionosphere influence Global Positioning System (GPS) positional accuracy. Data was collected 16 times from 27 February 2005 to 9 March 2005 on the ionosphere using radio propagation, on solar wind from NOAA, and on a GPS receiver. A relationship between GPS accuracy, disturbances in the ionosphere, and solar wind events was found. More research was advisable due to worldwide reliance on GPS. The research procedure was reevaluated and more data collected. Continuous data for the period 5 February to 20 February 2006 was collected on GPS accuracy, solar wind speed, solar wind proton density, the total electron content and maximum usable frequency of the ionosphere, the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field and the amount of electrical power at the poles. On February 5 2006 from 3:45 to 21:03 UTC, GPS positional error was very high (up to 50 m) and so was proton density, indicating a relationship. Another very probable relation was found on February 11 between proton density, GPS error, electrical charge at the poles, and Solar wind speed. A third relationship was found on February 15 between GPS error, proton density, solar wind speed, and electrical charge at the poles. It was concluded that solar wind and the ionosphere have a direct effect on GPS positional accuracy. It is recommended that a good solution to this problem be found in the interest of public safety.

NANOSCALE DISPLACEMENT METOROLOGY OF PIEZOELECTRIC ELEMENTS WITH OPTICAL FIBER INTERFEROMETRY (FOR NEAR-FIELD SCANNING OPTICAL MICROSCOPY AND OTHER APPLICATIONS)
Christian D. Lobo
Westview High School, Portland, Oregon, USA

In many applications, piezoelectric actuators control nanoscale positioning, especially in near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). This project implements an optical fiber interferometer, which creates a cavity between the fiber face and mirror for the laser interference, to accurately measure nanoscale amplitudes of piezoelectric tuning forks and vertical displacement of NSOM probes. Applying direct current to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) causes an elongation used to reposition the attached probe. Due to hysteresis, however, the motion of the PZT is does not consistently follow precise changes in applied voltages. Already in place to combat this, shear-force measurements from the probe secured to the tuning fork vibrating in the thin condensation film provide a feedback mechanism to control tip-sample distance. Since using the voltage on the PZT tube to interpret sample topography is inaccurate, measuring position with an interferometer gives accurate data for topography with a sensitivity of less than 0.5 nm. To improve the understanding of the behavior of the tuning forks generating shear force, their mechanical amplitudes have been measured from 0.5 nm to 3500 nm. These measurements provide data for lateral resolution of the scan and power dissipation from the tuning fork. The results from this project not only improve imaging of NSOM, but they can also be used in nanoscale frictional studies, or nanotribology.

STABILITY OF CONNECTED CHAOTIC CIRCUITS
Brandon John Campbell
Fremon High School, Plain City UT, United States

Many linked chaotic systems exist in nature. These links include ecological relations between prey and predator, weather systems, and economic balances. It has been established that an introduction of a periodic driving force can stabilize a chaotic system. It has also been established that two identical, but out of sync chaotic systems can be synchronized. This project investigates the stability of a chaotic circuit receiving data from a separate chaotic circuit. It was hypothesized that introduction of a small chaotic signal into a separate chaotic system could stabilize the receiving system.<br><br>Two identical circuits were constructed that produced chaotic signals. To bring one signal into the other slowly, an attenuator was set up as an interface using potentiometers. Data was gathered as the signal from the driving circuit was allowed into the receiving circuit from the Oscilloscope and stored on the computer.<br><br>The introduction of a -16 DB chaotic signal to a second chaotic signal caused the receiving system to become more chaotic. It was also observed that a non chaotic signal could be pushed into chaotic oscillation through the introduction of a chaotic signal.<br><br>The introduction of a chaotic signal into a separate chaotic system did not cause the receiving system to become more stable. Further investigations could be conducted to determine if the same character exists in other chaotic circuits. Connecting longer chains of chaotic circuits may also be investigated. <br><br>

This project aims at analyzing the stability and force balance of a simple mechanical gadget exhibiting magnetic levitation. The configuration consists of a pencil suspended horizontally in mid-air under the action of forces exerted by a set of ring magnets, gravity and a contact force. The configuration is found to be in perfectly stable equilibrium; the pencil can perform small oscillations and also rotate about its long axis. The project involved the following aspects. <br><br>1. The conditions under which stable equilibrium of the configuration<br><br>was achieved were determined by direct experimentation.<br><br>2. The field lines of the magnets were mapped to understand the forces acting in the system.<br><br>3. A theoretical analysis of the force and torque balance of the system was done by approximating each magnet to a small dipole. <br><br>4. Using this, the conditions for stable equilibrium of the system were found. These confirmed the consistency of the force and torque balance conditions.<br><br>5. Finally, definite predictions were made about various parameters of the gadget using the theoretical model. These were verified directly by experiment, thus consolidating the validity of the model.<br><br>Further avenues of investigation including the possibility of construction of similar configurations minimizing or without the use of contact forces, etc. are being explored.<br><br>This gadget can serve as an excellent pedagogical tool for illustrating diverse concepts like magnetic dipole interaction, force and torque balance, stability, etc. The project provides an understanding of magnetic levitation of static, extended bodies and shows that a prototype can be built with inexpensive, everyday materials.

This project is the result of many experiments made with electronic components and radioactivity.<br><br>The idea was to design and construct a simple, cheap and easy to repair and to build radiation detector(radioactivity detector) which can compete with other similar products present in the market.<br><br>The first and second experience were to construct the prototype and demonstrated that some part of the circuit was not working properly. After examining all the parts it was reached the conclusion that the audiofrecuncy amplier and the voltage multiplier had to be reformed. In the third experience, low levels of x ray radiation were detected succesfully but with low sensitivity. Later, in the fourth and fifth experience, the detector was improved after it was enough sensible to radioactivity. Diferent kinds of semiconductors were proved and some parts were redesigned. Finally, in the sixth experience radiactivity was detected with success and some things were added to make it more versatile.<br><br>The main contributions of this project are four:<br><br>First: it can be said that a sensible radiation detector can be made with cheap and not complex electronics components.<br><br>Second: although it has a simple design, the detector has high performance.<br><br>Third: the instrument works with semiconductors at room temperature instead of semiconductor detectors that work at criogenic temperatures.<br><br>Four: because of its low price and low complexity it can be acquired by the general public interested in it.

FACTORS IN THE FORMATION OF ANTIBUBBLES
James Ernest Hanson
Century High School, Rochester, Minnesota, USA

How do different factors affect the probability of an antibubble forming? This experiment studied the formation of antibubbles in solutions of surfactant in distilled water. Four specific factor experiments were conducted: (1) grounding the incoming stream to the tank and using a capacitor to dampen static charges, (2) applying a voltage across the stream and tank, (3) raising the temperature of the solution, and (4) using different types of solutions. The hypotheses were that using a capacitor would increase the formation rate of antibubbles, that voltage would inhibit the formation of antibubbles, that increased temperature would decrease the rate of formation of antibubbles, and that a sodium lauryl sulfate solution with glycerin would produce the most antibubbles. The factors were tested using a special apparatus that automatically created a stream that pulsed into a tank that overflowed into a pan. The stream created the antibubbles. The apparatus attempted to create antibubbles 100 times for each setting, and there were three trials for each factor. The results were as follows: (1) the capacitor produced the most antibubbles, (2) increasing voltage increasingly inhibited antibubble formation, (3) temperature had no observed effect on the formation of antibubbles in the range studied, and (4) the soap solution with glycerin produced the most antibubbles. The two hypotheses for the electrical experiments were supported, and the two hypotheses for the other experiments were not supported.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONVERTER
Denilson Luz Freitas
Colegio Opcao de Ensino, Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil

Highly efficient conversion of solar radiant energy into thermal energy is an essential aspect for the efficient use of solar energy. However, commercial heaters tend to have low efficiency (on the order of only 35%) and are costly. In the light of such a scenario, it is my objective to optimize the efficient use of solar conversion into thermal energy with less impact on the environment. This project is based on the following two questions: (1) what structural modifications can be used to obtain maximum efficiency , and (2) would the proposed modified structure, called ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONVERTER meet the market needs of low cost and high efficiency. <br><br> In view of the complexity of this scientific experiment, the procedure for the development of a structure that optimizes the transformation of solar energy into thermal energy was done in a CLOSED THERMAL SYSTEM (homemade lab). This ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONVERTER has an efficiency level of 49.06% compared to the 35% of commercial heaters, at a cost of approximately U$12.00 per structural meter, as well as a flow of boiling water of 1.99 kg/hour/meter length of the converter. Besides the above potential improvements, the operational viability of this converter is proven by its low costs and high efficiency. For this purpose, the CONVERTER was made available as a DESALINATOR in an area where the water supply was highly saline. It is expected that this CONVERTER may also be used as a steam generator as part of a thermal electric energy generator, or as a highly efficiency heater. <br><br>

ANATOMY OF AN ACCIDENT: PHYSICS APPLIED
Tamara June Parliament
Hamlin High School, Hayti, South Dakota, USA

This investigation focused on identification of factors which determine the severity of motor vehicle accidents. In-Line Collisions, both Rear End and Head On, as well as Angular Collisions were studied. Factors that were isolated included: Change in Momentum, Velocity and Kinetic Energy. Drag Factor Coefficient was also examined based on road surface conditions: specifically ice and gravel in comparison to normal road conditions. <br><br>Accident reconstruction was simulated using a software program which creates realistic diagrams of accident scenarios for interpretive analysis. The vehicle weight was standardized at 3500 lbs for all collisions. Rear End, Head On, and Angular Collisions were reconstructed at various speeds of impact to identify changes in physical factors being isolated. These specific collisions were selected for investigation because they typically represent those associated with differing road-surface conditions selected: normal, ice, gravel.<br><br>Based on calculations made throughout this investigation, it was concluded that speed is the most prevalent factor with regard to the physical forces transferred to a vehicle and its occupants. The greater the speed, the greater the changes in velocity and momentum generated during impact. <br><br>

<br><br> Using hydrogen gas to produce energy is one of the biggest topics in energy production right now. When hydrogen gas is used, there is no pollution. The problem is finding an efficient method of producing it.<br><br> The purpose of my project was to see some of the factors that effect hydrogen production. I constructed a container using the graphite rods from batteries and set them in a container. I added a saltwater solution to the container to conduct electricity produced from a battery. This process was used to separate the oxygen and hydrogen from the water. I collected the hydrogen gas at the negative electrode, using a graduated cylinder. I varied the distance between the electrodes, the temperature of the water and the amount of salt I added to the water.<br><br> I found the closer the electrodes, the faster the hydrogen gas was produced. The warmer the water the faster the hydrogen gas was produced, and the higher the salt concentration, the faster the hydrogen gas was produced.<br><br>

ATOMIC SIZE AND RUTHERFORD SCATTERING
Candice Murray
The Academy for Math, Engineering, and Science, Salt Lake City, UT, US

Many factors influence interactions between atoms. Experiments were carried out to attempt to ascertain which of these is the most significant. This was done by observing instances of Rutherford scattering. It was believed that atoms with a higher ratio of atomic mass to atomic radius would cause more Rutherford scattering. This would mean that both atomic size and atomic mass are important factors in determining interactions between atoms. The hypothesis was tested on four types of atoms: copper, aluminum, silver, and gold. Each atom type was then subjected to Rutherford scattering, and the results of that scattering observed. A success was defined as an alpha particle which passes through the atoms being tested which is scattered. The average percentage of successes was then computed for each atom type, resulting in a ranking from lowest amount of scattering to highest amount of scattering. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was then performed to ascertain the statistical significance of the results obtained, which showed the results to be very statistically significant. The collected data supports the hypothesis that an atom with a higher ratio of atomic mass to atomic radius would cause more Rutherford scattering. This suggests that atomic mass and atomic radius are two of the most influential factors in determining interactions between atoms.

OPTICAL TRANSMISSION THROUGH METALLIC SUBWAVELENGTH STRUCTURES
Arthur James Gottschalk
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL, U.S.A.

One critical area of optical research regards structures with microscopic dimensions (in particular the new field of surface plasmons). Theoretically, light waves cannot pass through slits of sizes smaller than their own wavelength without being vastly diminished. However, it has been experimentally shown that in certain conditions, light can pass through such “subwavelength” structures in startling amounts. This occurs as a result of the existence of a physics phenomenon known as surface plasmons on the surface of conductors possessing periodic structures. Transmission of infrared radiation was tested through several metallic subwavelength structures (the test area was a square with sides of one half millimeter) using an infrared spectrometer and results were analyzed using an analytical computer program and compared through the use of graphs. Many transmission phenomena were observed that occur as a result of surface plasmons. First, transmission was found to be larger than the open area. Secondly, the wavelength at which peak transmission occurs depends on periodicity of the structure. Finally, double-layer samples allow a large amount of transmission despite no direct line of sight through them. Practical applications of research regarding surface plasmons include revolutionary advances in computing, optical data storage, and microscopy.

OPTICAL, ACOUSIC, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEALTHWEAR A THIRD YEAR STUDY OF A NOVEL MATERIAL
Graham Edward Gintz
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC,

Previous carbon nanotube research revealed energetic and absorbent properties. Creating a composite called StealthWear™ made with a 1% carbon nanotube concentration by weight absorbed mechanical energy during mixing and battery electrical energy during matrix formation to overcome van der Waals forces aligning them evenly. The total energy consumed was calculated at near 100J. A 3mm-thick block was cut with a diamond saw and examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope. It was anisotropic along an X/Y axis with a measured elastic modulus of 5.10 +- 0.22 Gpa and calculated to be twice as hard (0.12 +- 0.01 Gpa) as epoxy alone.<br><br> Three-millimeter thick StealthWear™ blocks were tested using different wavelength light sources. An infrared erbium glass laser was used to calibrate the optical spectrometer equipped with a fiber optic bundle for collection of single photons. The data subsequently captured on an attached personal computer was graphed and analyzed for its absorbance/transmittance properties. Over 96% of the photons of the infrared to ultraviolet range, 20% of the X-rays and 5% of the Gamma rays were absorbed. By contrast, 1mm-thick films of nanotubes blended in acetone absorbed 60% of the photonic energy giving it absorbance properties disproportionate to its weight and size.<br><br> StealthWear™ had acoustic properties. A 1mm-thick material coating absorbed 26% of the decibels compared with 8% of the epoxy alone and 5% in the control. These experiments suggested that the novel StealthWear™ has optical and mechanical properties superior to existing high shock resistant matierals at a thinner size and lesser weight.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AC FREQUENCY ON THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF A YBA2CU3O7 HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTOR
Jonathan Joseph Naber

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of alternating current (AC) frequency on the voltage drop of a YBa2Cu3O7 high temperature superconductor. The author hypothesized that AC frequency would have a direct effect on the voltage drop of the superconductor.<br><br>The author attached a digital frequency generator to the current leads of a YBa2Cu3O7 four-point probe and a high-precision voltmeter to the voltage leads. The probe was then submersed in liquid nitrogen to achieve superconductivity. In each of the trials, the author ran through the 20 MHz frequency range, stopping at intervals of approximately .5 MHz, while video recording the applied frequencies and their corresponding DC voltage drop readings. <br><br>When frequency-voltage drop relationship graphs were created, there appeared to be at first a direct correlation, and then an inverse correlation between frequency and voltage drop, forming a curve. The author believes that the Reverse AC Josephson Effect is responsible for this relationship. The author also believes that the manifestation of this effect in a bulk superconductor could lead to the development of superconductor quality testing and possibly an abstract form of quantum computing.<br><br>In order to confirm that the phenomenon observed was exclusive to superconductivity, the author performed a similar procedure to that described above with the YBa2Cu3O7 probe at room temperature and a copper four-point probe. Because the effect was not observed in these trials, the author contends that the Reverse AC Josephson Effect was initially observed.<br><br>

THERE'S A VENTURI IN THE ATTIC
Lauren Makenzie Maddox
Midland High School, Midland, TX, USA

The purpose of the project "There's A Venturi in the Attic," was to determine whether it is feasible to use the Venturi Effect as a means of passive ventilation in residential attics. To determine whether a venturi would move an effective amount of air, a venturi was set up inside a box with a fan blowing between its reflecting airfoils. Using an anemometer, the rate of the air being moved out of the imaginary "attic space" was measured. From this data and the size of the tube being used, the rate of volume being moved was calculated. The second part of the experiment was to determine whether there was an optimum ratio between the width of the ends of the slats and the width at the middle of the slats at which the venturi operated at optimum efficiency. Although the principle works, application in the real world would be complicated due to such natural forces as the direction of the wind, the frequency of the wind, and the average speed of the wind. This experiment is ongoing. In the future, this project will be applied to an actual house in order to collect applied experimental data and compare these results with the efficiency of using other means of passive ventilation, such as an onion.

THE DETERMINATION OF THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGE OF GRID RADIATION THERAPY USING FILM AND THERMOLUMINESCENT DOSIMETRY
Navid John Soleimani-Meigooni
Henry Clay High School, Lexington, KY, United States

<br><br>GRID radiation therapy with megavoltage x-ray beam has been proven to be an effective technique for management of bulky tumors (>8 cm). Dosimetric characteristics of GRID radiation have been evaluated using film and thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). The high spatial resolution of film was found to be more suitable for this evaluation. The radiation distribution of 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams from a Varian linear accelerator was measured along two orthogonal directions relative to the beam axis and also along the beam axis. The measured beam profile along the perpendicular axis was utilized to estimate the therapeutic advantage (TR) of a GRID block radiation field. In this project, three different GRID block patterns: 1) 9.1 mm hole diameter and 19 mm center-to-center spacing, 2) 14 mm hole diameter and 24 mm spacing, and 3) 13 mm hole diameter and 18 mm spacing were utilized. These combinations allowed us to investigate the effect of the hole-size and spacing on the TR of the GRID block. These determinations were based on theoretical calculations using the linear quadratic model. The results of these investigations indicate that the TR increases by increasing the hole size of the GRID block and decreasing the spacing between the holes. Additionally, it has been found that the pattern of the GRID radiation has a more significant effect on radio-resistant cells than radiosensitive cells.

IN VITRO IDENTIFICATION OF CANCEROUS TUMORS BY RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY
Shannen Alexei Adcock
Central High School, Little Rock AR, United States

Current methods of identifying cancerous skin cells have proven inefficient and costly. The usual method of identification is through a biopsy, an invasive procedure with only a 63% diagnosis rate for practicing dermatologists. The use of the Raman Spectroscope can potentially increase the accurate diagnosis rate of skin cancer hundredfold. Skin cancer of the type malignant melanoma was analyzed using the Raman Spectroscope, which detects inelastically scattered photons (Raman Scattering) while factoring out elastically scattered photons (Rayleigh Scattering) excited by the 633 nm laser. Excitations at the wavelengths of 1445 and 1655 wavenumbers (cm-1) can be attributed to different proteins in the cells. Healthy skin cells show excitation at both wavenumbers, while cancerous skin cells show no excitation at the 1445 cm-1 wavenumber. Changes in the protein at 1445 cm-1 due to the presence of cancer cause a change in the emitted Raman signal, proposing a new method of identifying cancerous cells. The proposed non-invasive method achieved a 98% correct diagnosis rate, much better than current methods.<br><br>

DETECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CAPACITANCE VARIATIONS PRODUCED BY MOVING OBJECTS PHASE 3
Sean Thomas Malone
Malone Homeschool, Edgewood, New Mexico, USA

The purpose of phase 3 of this project is to determine what physical principles govern the operation of the sensor developed in the first two phases. It was found that the received signal is produced by a capacitive charge coupling effect between the moving object and the antenna on the sensor; in effect, the entire system operates as a differentiator. The sensor measures the first derivative of the capacitance between the moving object and the antenna. Using this information, equations were developed to accurately predict sensor response for both linear and circular motion of an object, and similar equations can be developed for any known movement pattern.<br><br> These equations were tested by moving an object in a set pattern and comparing mathematical predictions with experimental results. An average Pearson Correlation Coefficient of greater than 0.98 was determined for the relationship between predicted and experimental results. <br><br> Future work will include quantitatively varying the charge carried on the moving object and testing different motion patterns. Future investigations include the possibility of determining the location of the moving object using multiple synchronized sensors, differentiating between types of moving objects, and designing a directional antenna.<br><br> Although this technology will only work when there is no conducting material between the sensor and the moving object, the device has extensive applications in security systems, vehicle detection, and any situation where it is necessary to detect motion through a wall (such as a SWAT team standoff).<br><br>

Whitfield Albert Parham
Palmetto High School, Williamston, South Carolina, USA

The purpose of this project was to test my hypothesis that a subwoofer in a ported enclosure produces a louder sound than in a sealed enclosure or in no enclosure.<br><br> A ported plywood enclosure was built to house a twelve-inch subwoofer. A computer program and power amplifier were used to generate sine wave tones ranging from 30 Hz to 150 Hz in 5 Hz increments. Decibel levels were measured at a distance of 17.3 cm from the speaker under three conditions: 1) subwoofer in the enclosure with the port sealed, 2) subwoofer in the enclosure with the port opened, and 3) subwoofer without an enclosure.<br><br> Between the frequencies of 30 Hz and 60 Hz, the subwoofer in the enclosure with the port sealed produced the highest decibel levels. Between 60 Hz and 100 Hz, the subwoofer in the enclosure with the port opened produced the highest decibel levels. Between 100 Hz and 150 Hz, the subwoofer in the enclosure with the port sealed had identical decibel levels with the subwoofer in the enclosure with the port opened. Throughout nearly the entire frequency range (50 Hz to 150 Hz) the subwoofer without an enclosure produced significantly lower decibel levels.<br><br> When the subwoofer was in any type of enclosure, it produced a louder volume than when the subwoofer was not in an enclosure. This data generally supports my original hypothesis because the ported enclosure was either loudest or at least as loud as the other conditions over 75% of the frequencies tested.<br><br>

THE SUPERCRITICAL BRAYTON CYCLE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION
Ian Michael Rousseau
Essex High School, Essex Junction, Vermont, USA

Future space exploration missions will demand more power than current technology can supply. Electric ion thrusters are a new propulsion technology; they require 100-400 kW, more power than solar cells can supply. The Brayton cycle could meet these demands. This cycle consists of a re-circulating working fluid compressed in turbines. The Brayton cycle converts a nuclear reactor's thermal energy into electrical power. Brayton cycles have limited efficiency in space due to necessary high operating temperatures. Any fluid is supercritical when heated beyond its critical temperature. Critical temperature is the maximum temperature at which the fluid can exist as a liquid. Supercritical fluids have increased compressibility near the critical point. Performing compression near the critical point in the Brayton cycle increases efficiency. <br><br> This project evaluates phosphorus, iodine, steam, and tetraphosphorus decasulfide as supercritical working fluids in space. Supercritical fluids do not behave like ideal gases around the critical point. Supercritical fluid behavior was modeled in a computer simulation. Enthalpy and entropy departures from ideal gas behavior were calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation. The Peng-Robinson equation of state is accurate around the critical point. The efficiency of an equivalent ideal gas Brayton cycle was calculated as a control as the simulation iterated over a temperature interval.<br><br> Results show that the supercritical Brayton cycle was up to twice as efficient as an equivalent ideal gas Brayton cycle. The supercritical steam cycle performed best; it was up to 20% more efficient than other power sources such as thermoelectric converters or the sodium Rankine cycle.

The purpose of the experiment was to build and test the durability of a hovercraft. Instructions for building a hovercraft were downloaded from the internet. The hovercraft was made using materials that the instructions indicated: a piece of plywood, a sheet of plastic, and a leaf blower. The hovercraft was then brought to the school and tested on seven different surfaces with seven different weights. For each surface and weight, measurements were taken of the height that the hovercraft would rise above the surface.<br><br> The hovercraft was tested on hardwood floor, grass, carpet, painted cement, cement, tile and padded surface. Weights that were tested ranged from 0 Kilograms to 277 Kilograms. <br><br> Carpet did the best overall average in height but the hovercraft was not able to move with any amount of weight. The surface that provided the best overall performance was the hardwood floor which had the second best average height and allowed the hovercraft to move around on the surface easily. The worst was grass in overall height average and surface movement of hovercraft.

SENSITIVITY OF 1/F NOISE TO CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS --A STUDY OF PENTACENE & ITS OXIDATIVE IMPURITY IN THIN-FILM TRANSISTORS
Winston Xia Yan
Thomas Jefferson HS for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

1/f noise is a key parameter in material sciences and electronics, and has long been a tool for diagnosing device defects. It is the power spectrum of the Fourier transformed signal fluctuations, whose amplitude is inversely proportional to the frequency. This study is the first attempt to systematically investigate the sensitivity threshold of 1/f noise spectroscopy for the diagnosis of defects in organic electronic devices, with pentacene thin-film transistors (Pn-TFTs) as a model. <br><br> A series of TFTs with a gradient of 6,13-pentacenequinone (PQ), the oxidative impurity of pentacene, was created by either purifying commercially available pentacene or reintroducing PQ to it. The observed 1/f noise power rose proportionally to the increasing impurity, was sensitive to a PQ concentration difference of at least 0.6%, and could differentiate defects not discernable by the commonly used mobility values. This study demonstrated that altered chemical compositions causes electric current fluctuations in the transistors, which give rise to the 1/f noise that in turn affects the fundamental performance of organic TFTs. <br><br> Organic electronic devices belong to a new branch of nanotechnology. Its main promise lies in lower manufacturing cost, potentially capable of supplementing the prevailing lithographic chip technology. Devices made of such novel transistors would be flexible, light-weight, and inexpensive, creating a niche for applications hitherto inaccessible to silicon chips. Since pentacenequinone is a natural byproduct of pentacene degradation, the highly sensitive 1/f noise analysis will help delineate the quality, wear, or aging of such devices, thus benefiting their research and manufacture. <br><br><br>

FUEL CELL: A CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY
Andrew Lee Norvell
Glynn Academy, Brunswick GA, United States of America

The problem of this experiment was "Will performing an electrolysis on H2O2 produce more energy than performing an electrolysis on H2O." The experiment was set up using a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell. An electrolysis was performed with water which produced energy that was measured with an energy meter. Then the electrolysis was repeated with hydrogen peroxide. The voltage from this test was then measured. The results were as follows: The water produced a peak voltage of 1.32 volts and sustained voltage of 0.8 volts. The hydrogen peroxide produced a peak voltage of 1.35 and sustained voltage of 0.8 volts. Although the voltage was essentially the same, the gases produced were not. The water produced 8 mL of hydrogen and 9 mL of oxygen over four hours while the hydrogen peroxide produced 8 mL of hydrogen and 4 mL of oxygen. In conclusion performing an electrolysis on water is more efficient than performing an electrolysis on hydrogen peroxide.

A GENERAL MODEL FOR THREE WAY NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS
Renaldo Michael Webb
The Louisiana School For Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA, USA

<br><br> Next to the Higg’s Boson the neutrinos are the least understood Standard Model particles, because they interact very weakly with matter. Current data shows that, although the exact masses remain unknown, neutrinos have very light masses compared to other particles,and neutrinos oscillate from one flavor to another (there are three flavors corresponding to the electron, muon, and tau leptons). Current neutrino data consists of three of the nine neutrino mixing angles and the differences between the neutrino masses. Using the three known neutrino mixing angles and setting theta_13=0, which is consistent with current data and theory, the six unknown neutrino mixing angles were calculated by knowing that the neutrino mixing matrix is unitary. Using the unitary matrix the general form of the neutrino mass matrix was derived through an algebraic reverse diagonalization process..The general form of the neutrino mass matrix was derived as a guide for developing grand unified theories consistent with experimental data. Also since the neutrino mass matrix is related to the group theories of grand unified theories aesthetic vales for the neutrino mass matrix were expected. To accomplish this two new aesthetically pleasing versions of the neutrino mass matrix which agree with the original matrix are presented. Finally these two matrices are evaluated in great detail, and model predictions are calculated from the eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix and the unitary matrix.

MICROBIAL CELLS AND CORROSION PREVENTION
Mary Katherine Soltys
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY, USA

Metal corrosion costs billions of dollars each year in repairs and material replacement. It is a special problem for structures exposed to water. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a microbial fuel cell system could reduce and possibly prevent freshwater corrosion of iron. Winogradsky columns with embedded electrodes in the deep anaerobic mud were allowed to mature for months. These generated potential differences greater than 500 mV between the deep mud and oxic water at the surface. Iron samples were placed in the oxic water. Anaerobic organisms residing in the mud are known to produce electrons as a result of their metabolic processes. A conductive path through various external resistors allowed an electron flow to the iron sample. It was hypothesized that these electrons supplied to the metal samples would galvanically protect them from corrosion. Surprisingly, the iron samples were not protected when the embedded electrodes were connected to the samples by resistors lower than 100,000 ohms. In fact, a greater percentage mass loss than in the unprotected was shown. However, iron corrosion protection was reduced when the resistance was increased to the Megohm and tens of Megohm region.

NOISE REDUCTION IN AQUATIC SYSTEMS
Margaret Louise Greenwood
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, Missouri, United States

The intent of this project was to find an applicable system of reducing noise in an indoor pool. The research began with finding characteristics of sound absorbing materials and design patterns that would absorb the most sound. It was found that porous materials absorb sound better than more dense materials. Other research showed that checkered patterns should absorb more noise than a solid panel of material.<br><br> A mock pool was constructed using a ten gallon aquarium, concrete board, wood, nuts, bolts, and sealed with duct tape. A metronome issuing a constant tone at 440 Hz was hung from one wall while a small hole was cut in the opposite wall to allow a sound level meter measuring in decibels (dB) to get a reading.<br><br> The material used in Phase I was insulating foam. This material was too dense to absorb sound and amplified it instead. A second control was taken for Phase II. This set of trials used cloth-covered insulating foam, sponge foam cubes, irregular sponge foam shapes, and strips of cloth. There was a significant difference in all trials except the cloth-covered insulating foam and sponge foam cubes. The trials with fabric streamers had highly significant results. There were 280 trials total in all three phases.<br><br> Possible future explorations include egg crate foam and different patterns of the cloth strips. Time intervals could be increased and perhaps more trials for each scenario. A possible solution would be to hang banners above the pool.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SALT WATER CRYSTALLIZATION ON MONOPOLE ANTENNA RECEPTION
Danielle Marie Hettmann
Battlefield High School, Haymarket VA, United States

During this experiment, the effect of salt water crystallization on monopole antenna reception was studied. It was hypothesized that salt water crystallization, over a test period of 21 days, would cause antenna reception to decrease in signal strength. Three monopole antennas were constructed and interfaced with a short wave radio and personal computer. Each antenna was sprayed daily with an ocean salt water solution. Nightly, the effect of the salt water solution was measured by capturing a wave file through the computer interface for each antenna, and a visual signal strength observation was made based on the reception level indicated on the radio. The experiment yielded results that indicated a downward trend in reception levels inversely relating to the amount of salt crystallization on the respective antenna. Noticeable temporary increases in reception were noted on days with weather conditions other then clear skies. The weather related increases in reception can be attributed to changes in the ionosphere. These changes reflect radio signals, returning more radio frequency energy to the antenna. The crystallization of salt water on monopole antennas corroded the element wire, resulting in a decrease of antenna reception levels. This decrease in reception was believed to be caused by more radio frequency energy going to ground than to the short wave radio. The results of this experiment can be applied to the daily operation of Navy ships communication antennas. Salt water crystallization over a period of deployment could cause a loss of antenna reception and vital communication capabilities.

SURFACE TENSION OF LIQUIDS
Miranda Jo Meier
Dickinson Trinity High School, Dickinson, North Dakota, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to find and compare the surface tension of various liquids. The liquids I used were water, salt water, diluted laundry detergent, vegetable oil, orange juice, and milk.<br><br> My hypothesis was that vegetable oil would have the most surface tension and water would have the least. The reason why I thought this is because vegetable oil is thick and water is thin.<br><br> First, I built a simple balance. Then I tested the weight it took to pull a needle off of the surface of the six different liquids. When I had those numbers, I used two formulas to find the surface tension, one was to convert the weight into force, and the other was to find the surface tension itself. <br><br> Water had a surface tension of 16.5 mN/m, salt water 17.68 mN/m, diluted laundry detergent, 11.4 mN/m, vegetable oil, 17.88mN/m, orange juice, 20.8 mN/m, and milk 21.3 mN/m. <br><br> Arranged from greatest surface tension to least, the liquids would be: milk, orange juice, vegetable oil, salt water, water, and diluted laundry detergent.<br><br> The results of my experiment show that my hypothesis was incorrect. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF TONE HOLES IN WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS
Colby Anne Wilkason
Warner Robins High School, Warner Robins, GA, USA

Investigation of tone holes in woodwind instruments. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of tone holes on the frequencies produced by a woodwind instrument. The hypothesis was the scientist could design a clarinet out of standard PVC pipe that would produce a desired range of frequencies by using a combination of formulae that would compute the location of tone holes based on a desired tone and cutoff frequency. The hypothesis was accepted. The independent variables were pipe diameter, pipe wall thickness, the desired frequencies, and the hole sizes. The dependent variables were the pipe length, the tone hole locations, the cutoff frequencies, the measured frequencies, and the timbre. In this experiment, the scientist used different formulas to compute the PVC pipe length and the tone hole placement. The input variables were the tone hole size and the desired frequencies. Then,the scientist used four, thick-walled, quarter-inch PVC pipe, for four instruments. Two of them, Fredo Two and Fredo Three, were used to produce the D3 scale. The other two, Egghead One and Egghead Two, were used to produce the A3 scale. The scientist then compared the measured frequency to the desired frequency for each note a total of three times. The results of this experiment showed the measured and the desired frequencies were almost exact. The scientist would use this information for further investigations concerning the different instruments.

SYNTHESIS OF CLEAN FUEL FROM A RENEWABLE SOURCE
Ziyad Husni Abdel Khaleq, Amen A. Modhafar
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Energy exhaustion and scarcity, additionally to air pollution, have become widely acknowledged issues concerning environment professionals and international political matter. This project is designed and constructed to help solving these dangerous global problems using physical methods. The hypothesis was that the cleanest fuel to be synthesized; producing no pollutants is Hydrogen, our aim. Suiting the project’s aim a clean, renewable and cheap source of electricity was needed to start electrolysis process of water, hence, considering the expenses and efficiencies of energy sources; sun was chosen to synthesize hydrogen. <br><br> The project is made, first, from a stainless steel paraboid that has a 2 meter focal line, so that sun rays fallen parallel to the focal line will be reflected and concentrated on 5 black copper pipes situated in the focal line, filled with water. The sun rays will increase the water’s temperature that will exceed boiling point under pressure, providing that the system is insulated. When the steam’s pressure inside the pipes exceeds 4 bars, it is released to rotate a turbine, attached to a DC generator that induces enough electricity to charge rechargeable batteries, then used to start the electrolysis of salty water producing Hydrogen gas trapped at the cathode. <br><br> We were able to produce considerable amounts of Hydrogen, as the electricity induced by the solar reflector is enough for the electrolysis process, relative to the size of the system. Therefore, it’s concluded that (on larger scale) the project will convert energy; solar into chemical, producing the most convenient fuel.

Concern of electromagnetic radiation from cell phones has been addressed due to the potential of carcinogen effects based on electromagnetic emissions. This project was not only to determine the intensity of radiation from various phones, but also to reduce cell phone radiation output. <br><br> Linking a gauss meter, which detects ELFs, or electromagnetic fields, to a general voltage meter, an accurate digital reading was received. An adequate quantity of cell phones, 15 to be exact, was collected and their radiation discharges were measured. The same proximity of the phone to the meter, and similar battery discharge were controlled throughout the experiment. Then, by using lead plates and tin, the radiation output of each phone through each medium was measured<br><br> Following the experimentation of reducing radiation in cellular phones, it was found that lead, as well as tin proved to be significantly beneficial as barriers of the radiation. Ultimately, lead proved to be the superior barrier to the radiation.<br><br> This research encouraged a future study to eliminate perilous discharge from cell phones. Cell phones are among the most used appliances today. Because of their popularity, emissions must be controlled and possible hazards eliminated. <br><br>

ELASTOMERIC GRATING FOR WAVELENGTH SWITCHING IN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
Maria Katrina Derez Guevara, Ace Fredric Resurreccion Palabrica, Nicole Andrea San Agustin Yazon
Philippine Science High School - Main Campus, Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines

A diffraction grating was fabricated from an elastic polymer. It was patterned after plane reflection grating with a pitch of 1,200lines/mm. It was characterized using a HeNe laser to verify grating properties. <br><br>Angular scanning as a function of applied strain was observed for two individual wavelengths. Intensity of fiber output was optimized as an application of angular scanning in fine alignment. <br><br>Beam profiles showed consistency of first order diffraction intensities at different levels of strain. This showed that the elastomeric grating’s efficiency is independent from strain. <br><br>The elastomeric grating’s variable pitch can be of immense utility in optical communication systems. A stretchable grating can be used to replace typical high-cost architectures of metal or glass gratings of different pitches that correspond to various spectral regions. By changing the pitch, the grating can be used to scan different wavelengths over a wide range of angles. <br><br>Angular scanning is used for wavelength channel selection. And since elastomeric grating diffracts different wavelengths differently, it can be used for wavelength switching and wavelength division multiplexing in optical communication systems. Laser beams of different wavelengths carrying different signals can be transmitted simultaneously through an optical fiber and diffracted to route the wavelengths onto separate wavelength-specific channels.<br><br>

THE PHYSICS OF PAINTBALL THE EFFECT OF THE PNEUMATIC RAM ON THE PERFORMANCE OF A PAINTBALL MARKER
Kyle Heideman, Joseph Schafer
Buena High School, Sierra Vista Az, United States

This experiment is designed to test and observe the physics and mechanics of a paintball marker; specifically measuring the effect a pneumatic ram plays in the operation of the paintball marker. It is intended to scientifically test and perhaps improve the current technology employed in today’s markers and to gain a better understanding of the involved mechanisms of a paintball marker.<br><br>Research into the dynamics of paintball markers will improve understanding in an area that has not been scientifically tested in the literature. No published studies on the dynamics of paintball markers were found through multiple search engines. One notable theme during the literature search was testimony to improved paintball marker performance with different ram weights. This research also sets out to challenge and validate these statements.<br><br>Methodology consisted of using six different hammers to find their effect on the velocity of the paintball, precision of the paintball shots, the sound level and the force of the kick. Two tests using five paintballs were used for each of the six hammer weight. The data was compiled and graphed for analysis and comparison. <br><br>This project demonstrated that there is little correlation between the reciprocating mass in a paintball marker and the velocity, kick, sound, or precision. There is a slight relationship in velocity and precision to the internal mass. As mass increases, both precision and velocity increase thus proving our hypothesis. Sound, as hypothesized, was unaffected. Accuracy was un-testable due to the inconsistency of the paintballs used in testing. No relationship was found between force and internal mass.<br><br>

AN APPROACH TO UAV DEPLOYMENT WITH WATER ROCKETS
Trent William Lukaczyk, Travis Weston Halbert
James W. Robinson Jr. Secondary School, Fairfax, Virginia, United States

The first phase of this experiment was aimed at building and calibrating a differential pressure water flow-rate meter. Total and static pressures were measured in this phase. The data was incorporated into a derivation of Bernoulli’s equation in order to develop a calibration curve. The flow-rate meter allowed mass flow-rate to be calculated. The meter was used in phase two, as well as employed to predict water rocket height.<br><br> <br><br>The second phase sought to optimize a water rocket “engine.” To accomplish this, the specific impulses of different nozzle designs (specifically different diameters and lengths) as well as different air pressures were compared. The apparatus, which was used to measure thrust force, isolated the effect of the equal and opposite reaction of the water on a rocket's thrust force. The data showed that the smallest nozzle, without any extension, under the highest tested pressure was the most effective.<br><br> <br><br>The third phase incorporated the results from phase one and two in order to design the rocket with the optimal nozzle configuration. Additionally, the centers of pressure and mass were considered in designing the rocket. This rocket was also meant to test the concept of aerially deploying a model unmanned aerial vehicle ("UAV"). A water rocket capable of delivering a UAV into flight would have several advantages over chemical rockets; these include lower costs, safer operation, and absence of a heat signature. <br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPASS PULSE CLEANER FOR ULTRAFAST HIGH-POWER LASERS
Alexander Chernyak, Pavel Chvykov
International Academy, Boomfield Hills, Michigan, United States

A novel multipass laser pulse cleaner that increases contrast to twelve orders of magnitude was developed with a world-record breaking transmission.<br><br> This work was inspired by the need to develop a system which would make efficient solid-target experiments for ultrafast (pulse-duration ¡Ö 30 femtoseconds) high output-power (~50 TeraWatt) lasers possible. Remarkable progress in laser technology has recently allowed for intensities as high as 10^22 W/cm^2. <br><br> Such ultrahigh intensities present exciting possibilities for a cost-effective and versatile (one-thousand-times cheaper and smaller) source of the proton beam which can be used to eliminate cancer cells, while not harming healthy tissue. Furthermore, these high-intensity lasers can be used for fast ignition of controllable thermonuclear fusion reaction which may emerge as an environmentally cleaner and more-efficient energy source. <br><br> But these fascinating technologies can only be achieved if the laser pulse with such extreme intensity will have a contrast not worse than 10^11. With a lower contrast (10^8 preceding this work), the pre-pulse of the beam would vaporize the solid target prior to the main pulse interaction with the target. <br><br> This was accomplished by separating the polarization of different intensity light (XPW effect), and then suppressing the low intensity light by the means of a polarizer. For the first time in laser physics, a unique concept of using XPW more than once was utilized via multiple passes through the crystal.<br><br> This system was proven and successfully implemented into the 50 TW "Hercules" laser. It produced a contrast of 10^12 with a transmission of 35%, which is the highest known.

IS THERE TORQUE IN YOUR TOAST? A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF A FALLING RECTANGULAR OBECT

<br><br>It's happened to almost everyone. They sit at the breakfast table buttering their toast, their knife is lifted to spread the jelly on when, "oops", splat, the toast is knocked to the floor, butter side down. Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop a simplified model that aids in the explanation of a uniform rectangular object always landing on the same side after falling off a sharp edge. This will be accomplished by dropping a rectangular toast-shaped board off a sharp-edged surface and analyzing the fall. The researchers hypothesize the following: Total height, static friction, and the total rotation angle are factors in the orientation of how a uniform rectangular object will land. This project shows the mathematics of what occurs when a uniform rectangular object (i.e. toast) falls off a sharp-edged surface. Mass of the rectangular falling object is not a factor when determining which side will land facing up. Height from which the object falls and the total rotation angle are both major factors for determining which side lands up.

THERMAL EFFECTS ON THE DEGENERATION OF PERMANENT MAGNETS
Alan Hayden Cherney, Danil Efron Smiles
Niles North High School, Skokie, Illinois, United States of America

The objective of the experiment was to analyze the effects of temperature variations on the strength of a permanent magnet's magnetic field in order to judge the stability of the magnet. As temperature increases above absolute zero, the magnetic field strength decreases until it approaches the Curie point, at which the magnet ceases to exhibit magnetic properties. It was hypothesized that if the temperature of a permanent magnet is increased then the resulting magnetic field will decrease at a rate dependent upon its composition.<br><br> To test the hypothesis, a CBL system was used to simultaneously measure both the variations in temperature and the magnetic field. The gaussmeter was calibrated to disregard the magnetic field of the surroundings. Alnico, neodymium, and ceramic magnets, all ferromagnets, were tested individually. Magnets were heated to 100 degrees Celsius and then cooled, with measurements being taken two centimeters from the positive pole of the magnet at twenty second intervals.<br><br> The data collected supports the idea that the alnico magnets have the most stable magnetic field in terms of temperature, while the neodymium magnets are highly temperature-dependent, and showed that the rate of degeneration of the magnetic field strength was dependent on the composition of the magnet.<br><br> These results are very significant because they may have a momunetal effect on the industrial field, where magnets are required to perform at a constant strength despite fluctuations in temperature. While neodymium is the strongest magnet, it should not be used in a setting that involves any variation in temperature. Alnico, on the other hand, while weaker, is much more stable when put through a temperature gradient.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LASER EFFICIENCY: THE EFFECT OF SCATTERING SURFACES INSIDE A DIFFUSE REFLECTOR SOLID STATE LASER PUMP CHAMBER
Chelsey Lynn Webb, Alexandra Smith, Skyler Griffin
Hilton Head Prep, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina 

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the efficiency of the pump chamber would be diminished if the outside surface and/or the bores of the flow tube had a “frosted” or non-polished finish. <br><br> The hypothesis is the surface finish on the flow tube will have minimal effect upon the pump chamber efficiency. This hypothesis was based upon several observations. The luminous flux of ordinary frosted and non-frosted light bulbs of the same power is nearly identical. Additionally, the light from the flashlamp is highly scattered by the diffuse reflector; additional scattering from the surfaces of the flow tube should have minimal effect upon efficiency.<br><br> The experimental apparatus used to test the hypothesis consisted of a commercially available Ho:YAG laser. The only variable in the system that was changed was the finish on the optical surfaces of the flow tube. Efficiency data was recorded for the different flow tube configurations. Several fully polished flow tubes were used as a control. <br><br> The experimental results support the hypothesis. There was essentially no difference in the efficiency of the pump chambers with ground surfaces. A benefit of this work is that flow tubes with a finely-ground surface are approximately forty percent less expensive. <br><br> Future planned work includes testing flow tubes using a different flow tube material and different degrees of frosting. <br><br>

LIFT OFF! WORKING WITH WINGS AND PRESSURE
Abigail Cristine Khushf, Minru Wong
Dreher High School, Columbia, South Carolina, United States Of America

An old theory of lift, still found in text books, states that airflow above an airfoil takes the same time to travel from the leading to trailing edge as the airflow below (the principle of equal transit time). Since the upper part of the airfoil is longer (it is curved), velocity is greater. Bernoulli’s principle then explains lift as the difference in static pressures associated with the difference in velocity of airflow. This theory of lift can be modeled by the flow of an incompressible, frictionless fluid through a venture tube.<br><br> To experimentally test these assumptions, we used an air blower and venturi tube and measured total and static pressures for different velocities of airflow using water manometers. We also conducted an experiment to determine whether total pressure can be obtained by a tube that is vertical to airflow and the wide part of a venturi tube preceding constriction of airflow. We use our data to determine pressure differences that would arise on a wing model by a venturi tube, and compared this to the lift that would be needed for a Cessna Skyhawk. We found that airflow in the venture tube is not incompressible or frictionless. If we account for these properties of airflow, a venturi tube could be used to model airflow where we do not have equal transit times.<br><br>

FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF CARBON NANOTUBES
Tirth Tarang Patel, Byron Lowry
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, FL, USA

Our experiments were performed to see if it is possible to utilize carbon nanotubes as solid state lubricrants. In order to complete this with a minimum cost and a lack of available resources, we decided to use simulations, via NanoHive to see how the resistance forces would chnage if we changed the diameter of the nanotubes. We discovered that as the diameter of the tube increases, the overall resistance force increases, but the rate at which it increases decreases. This was partially due to the graphene sheet bonding to the carbon nanotube. Also, since as the diameter increases, the vertical elasticity of the tube increases, the tubes act as cylindrical springs absorbing vertical compressional forces, decreasing the shock caused by the sheet, therefore decreasing the ewar on the sheets. This also slowed the tube down by incresasing the eccentricity of a cross section of the tubes, making tread-like structures in place of wheel-like structures, which are less efficient, voiding our hypothesis that carbon nanotubes can be used as lubricants, at least between graphene sheets.

THE EFFECT OF SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH-INDUCED G-FORCES AND MICROGRAVITY ON SOYBEAN SEEDS PLANTED IN A SIMULATED LUNAR SOIL TREATED WITH BIO-SOLID--PHASE IV
Rachel Jean Lisson
Cloquet Senior High, Cloquet, MN, U.S.

When colonizing living on the moon, high-quality food (soybeans) is a main priority, while at the same time utilizing local resources (lunar soil) and finding innovative ways to reuse waste (bio-solid). The question is how does space shuttle launch-induced g-forces (g-forces) and microgravity affect soybean seeds grown in a simulated lunar soil treated with bio-solid? The hypothesis is if soybean seeds are treated to g-forces and microgravity, then growth will be affected. This year’s study looked at the effect of g-forces and microgravity on soybean seeds transported form the earth to the moon. To prepare the soil, crushed basaltic rock and bio-solid was divided into 65 containers. To produce g-forces, an old record player was turned into a g-force simulator, which created 3 g-forces. To create the microgravity machine, parts from a junkyard were utilized: a treadmill, a motor from a sewing machine, and an 8-gallon (gal) water jug. To simulate microgravity, vertical rotation turned the seeds in the water jug at the rate of 1.2 rev/sec, simulating 1 g on earth, while creating freefall. Batches of 4 sets of seeds were done: controls, 3 g-forces/10 minutes (min), microgravity, and 3 g-forces/10 min/microgravity. The normal situation of 3 g-forces/10 min negatively affects leaf width, while positively effecting height and leaf number. When seeds are exposed to 3 g-forces/10 min. and microgravity, height, leaf width, and number were negatively affected while positively affecting stem diameter and root biomass. When looking at microgravity, height, leaf number, length, and width were negatively affected.

COSMIC RAIN: INVESTIGATING PARTICLES FROM SPACE
Holly Reid Batchelor
The Mary Erskine School, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom

The first aim was to investigate the angular distribution of cosmic rays at sea level, to confirm modern day theories. A cosmic ray hodoscope was constructed, consisting of two scintillator paddles, each coupled to a photomultiplier tube; the pulses from which were then sent to a circuit board that counted cosmic ray flux. These paddles were positioned a metre apart, counting only a small angular range of cosmic rays. This was then angled at varying degrees from the zenith.<br><br> Theoretical calculations estimated the flux at various angles from the zenith using stated vertical flux measurements and the cos-squared-theta rule discovered by Crookes and Rastin in 1972. The results from the hodoscope correlated with the expected cos-squared-theta curve for angles less than 75º but for larger angles the results were higher than the estimated flux as cosmic rays could enter both ends of the hodoscope.<br><br> A second investigation used the Teach Spin muon lifetime apparatus, counting muon decays, to determine the energy spectrum of muons at sea level. For a muon to decay within the detector it must have had a specific energy. The resulting graphs confirmed that flux was evenly distributed for all energies.<br><br> The third task was to design and construct a diffusion cloud chamber for viewing particle tracks left by cosmic rays. The aim was to make a cheap, reliable chamber to make particle physics accessible to school pupils. The chamber was constructed for under $80 and particle tracks could be seen clearly.

ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURAL AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF CO(18-X)CU(X) ALLOYS AND THIN FILMS
Bing Han
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville FL, USA

A number of copper/cobalt alloys Co(18-x)Cu(x) were synthesized using the electric tri-arc furnace. The structural and magnetic properties were studied over a range of compositions, and a shift in the magnetization trend was observed at a critical concentration. The samples were annealed to check the effect of heat treatment on the structural and magnetic properties of these alloys. A small change in structural properties was observed, but the magnetic properties showed no significant change after annealing, suggesting that a longer annealing time was required.<br><br> Cobalt thin films were sputtered using the UHV (ultra-high vacuum) magnetron sputtering system, and their magnetic and surface properties were characterized using SQUID and AFM. It was observed that the thin films become oxidized with time. Also, a comparison between the bulk cobalt samples and the thin films of thickness 20 nm was made to see the size effect on the properties of cobalt.<br><br> The physical properties of nanostructured materials differ fundamentally from that of the corresponding bulk materials. This is due to reduced dimensionality and modification of fundamental properties as the system size approaches quantum mechanical length scales. Exploring the interplay between geometry, structure, morphology, and the electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of nanoscale sized systems is of fundamental importance to the design of nanostructures with favorable properties. Several research projects within the research school aim at basic issues of this interplay. Different complementary experimental techniques are used for studying the electronic and optical properties of well-defined systems.<br><br>

TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE PLANET (ON THE SEARCH FOR EXTRASOLAR PLANETS)
Fran Zylo Cuaresma Jacalne
Kauai High School, Lihue Hawaii, U.S.A.

Abstract<br><br> My Science Fair Project was about searching for other planets that orbit other stars and studying their behavior in the heavens. This was done by computer modeling/simulating with a computer console called the “system integrator console” or “systemic”. If I were to publish my models and their data, they would be compared to real light-curve data from astronomers’ telescopes. If the models match the gathered data, then the star from which data was gathered may be the real life manifestation of the model. I had questions about what would happen to the model system if I applied certain factors to it. These factors consisted of gravitational dimensions such as number of orbiting planets, their sizes, the orbital eccentricity, and others. I hypothesized about what the system would be like if it had an even number or an odd number of planets. (I isolated one of the factors, which was the number of orbiting planets). I also hypothesized about how the star would behave if its orbiting planets had either highly eccentric or regular circular orbits. (I isolated another factor, which was the orbital eccentricity of the orbiting planets). I tested these conditions on a variety of simulations that I created, and I found that the simulated systems with an odd number of planets seem to possess frequent, extreme spikes of red shift in the light-curves. I also found that the systems that have highly eccentric planetary orbits possess very radical and dynamic light-curves. This was a study in theoretical astrophysics.<br><br> As a follow-up to this simulation exercise, I would like to collaborate with real astronomers to compare simulated light-curves with actual stellar spectrometry.<br><br>

BRILLOUIN LIGHT SCATTERING
Matthew Jonathan Wenger
Thomas B. Doherty High School, Colorado Springs CO, United States

When photons interact with the precessing magnetic moments in a ferromagnet (magnons) some of these photons undergo an inelastic scattering process in which energy is either lost or gained from the spin motion. The small energy shift in the photons is equivalent to the energy of the magnon. The purpose of this project is to determine the relationships between several variables (e.g. applied magnetic field, angle of interaction and light’s power) and the energies of these magnons.<br><br> Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) is used to measure the small energy shifts. Thin-film samples of iron and permalloy were placed in a homemade, rotatable holder between the poles of an electromagnet. A laser beam was focused on the sample and then directed through an interferometer and photomultiplier to be analyzed. A computer connected to the setup then created a spectrum indicating the frequencies of the magnons within the samples.<br><br> It was found that magnons within iron contain much more energy than those in permalloy when variables are constant. Next, as the angle between the laser beam and sample becomes more acute, the magnons’ energies increased. Also, as the applied magnetic field in the samples was increased, the energy shifts also increased. Finally, as the beam’s power increased, the magnons remained at a constant energy. <br><br> These measurements provide a characterization tool for magnetic materials because one can obtain important properties of the magnet such as the saturation magnetization. This parameter is very important in hard disk systems which store information in a magnetic material. <br><br>

TESTING THE METTLE OF METALLIC GLASS
Leslie Ann Spahr
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, Florida, United States of America

Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) are formed when an alloy of more than three metals of different atomic size are cooled quickly, forcing the atoms to freeze before they can crystallize. Because of their unique structure, BMGs possess properties that far exceed those of most crystalline metals, such as high corrosion resistance, tensile strength, hardness, and self-sharpening properties. <br><br> The amorphous structure of BMGs also condemns it to limited ductility and quick fracture propagation, caused by shear bands below areas of applied stress. Experimentation has shown that local melting occurs under high strain, and these parts could possibly solidify as crystals near the areas of stress, inhibiting the spread of shear bands. If nanocrystals can be formed by nanoindentation, this could increase the ductility of BMG by obstructing shear bands.<br><br> A prepared sample of Vitreloy 1 (Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be), a BMG, was nanoindented. This sample was observed under a Transmission Electron Microscope at depths of 6, 8, and 10 microns, and no evidence of nucleation was found. <br><br> The absence of nanocrystals can be explained by considering phase separation. For most BMGs, the alloy is too “frustrated” to immediately crystallize, and it must separate into two domains of different compositions which are more compatible. Because the composition of Vitreloy 1 is so diverse, the process from phase separation to nucleation takes too long for the crystals to form during nanoindentation. <br><br>

FINDING THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH
Stephen Alexander McCrory
Pensacola High School, Pensacola Florida, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to use a collection of Newton’s ideas to find the weight of the Earth. Theoretically, by comparing the angle between an unaffected plumb bob and a plumb bob affected gravitationally, one can find the weight of the Earth. This assumes the Earth to be a perfect sphere, unaffected by orbit, and equally dense through the planet. The “weight” of the Earth symbolizes the force created if two Earths were to be attracted to one another.<br><br>Clearly, a plumb bob would not offer enough accuracy, instead I used surveying equipment. Stone Mountain would function as a gravitational influence. By designating two points on the base and top of the mountain, I could find the angle needed by aiming the equipment from one point to the other. The weight of the objects and the location of the test points are needed to find the Earth’s weight.<br><br>Another value needed was the center of mass of the mountain. I found the weight of the mountain displayed at the park. Through Google™ Earth I had access to heights and coordinates of the mountain. This was enough information to plug into the equations that I had formed prior. However, the angle that I found was small and negative. The actual angle should have been small and positive.<br><br>I found an angle extremely close to the one I hypothesized. However, the surveying equipment was off because of the machine’s sensitivity being less than the experiment called for.<br><br>

DRIVING FLOW AND CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR
Jacob Douglas Reid
Lakeside High School, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

This study attempted to identify the effect of increasing flow rates on the chaotic, or nonperiodic, behavior of the Lorenzian waterwheel, a mechanical model of Edward Lorenz's convection current equations. Chaos is a phenomenon present in complex as well as simple systems, and many scientific pursuits could be aided by an enhanced understanding of its nature. Research and observation led to the hypothesis that as the rate of driving flow increased past a critical point, the Lorenzian waterwheel would display chaotic behavior, to be characterized by the absence of a repeating pattern or steady revolution.<br><br>The experiment consisted of using varying flow rates of water to power a waterwheel with holes punctured in the bottom of its buckets. The waterwheel was filmed using a digital camera for a duration of thirty seconds for every flow rate used. The footage was employed to analyze the position of the waterwheel every tenth of a second. Angular velocity was calculated and graphed over time and position. When graphed, it was readily apparent that the two hyothesized types of behavior, periodic and chaotic, were present. Half of the flow rates tested demonstrated periodic motion, rotating back and forth within a similar range of points. Conversely, the faster flow rates displayed no pattern, with the waterwheel changing directions and velocities in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. Consequently, the hypothesis was confirmed.

GET DOWN!
Anthony Charles Gordon
Martin County High School, Stuart, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project was to see how the shape and surface area of a car’s spoiler wing affected the downward force it created. At the conclusion of the experiment the researcher was able to conclude that surface area of a wing does affect the downward force a wing produces and the shape seemed to have no affect on the downward force.<br><br>To carry out this experiment the researcher constructed a wind diffuser to create a laminar flow of the wind, and conducted the experiment in the researcher’s garage. The garage was closed off to any other wind obstructions such as a/c and wind gusts from outside. After each wing was tested five times at two different wind speeds the researcher was able to draw the conclusions. The researcher was able to observe that as surface area increases downward force increases and that the ratios of force over surface area were relatively the same for all the wings.<br><br>In the end the hypothesis was correct and surface area does affect the amount of downward force created by a wing. <br><br>

COOLING LIQUIDS – THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
Antonin Hoskovec
Gymnasium U Balvanu 16, U Balvanu 16, Jablonec nad Nisou, 466 34, Czech Republic

Cooling liquids close to absolute zero is of great importance in physics since refrigeration is essential in order of utilizing superconductivity and other features in modern science. One particular method of cooling is withdrawing vapour from a vessel containing liquid and its vapour in equilibrium. Despite the high efficiency of this method, it is mostly used for refrigerating liquids close to absolute zero. The aim of this project is to study the possibilities of this technique at temperatures around 273 K, in order to propose it for a technological use. The project involves both the theoretical understanding as well as constructing a device suitable of cooling ethanol. <br><br>I have designed an apparatus consisting of two hermetic acrylic glass containers - one inside the other, glass tubes and a compressor. The process takes place in the inner container of total volume 10 dm3. I have designed a digital sensor and driving circuits so that the process is controlled and measured by computer. After solving some theoretical and construction difficulties, I have achieved a temperature drop by 15°C in the entire volume of ethanol.<br><br>The temperature vs. time curve of the process exactly fits the equation nv ~ exp(-U/kT), where nv is the number of molecules jumping to vapour phase and T is the temperature; it therefore proves the theoretical expectations. The biggest potential of this method perhaps lies in cooling huge volumes of liquids. This could have a wide range of uses: it could be used as a first stage in liquefaction of nitrogen, in sugar factories for cooling suspension with crystals of sugar, etc. With efficient enough compressors, the method might be capable of cooling whole dams of liquids at once.<br><br>

PROPELLANTLESS PROPULSION: THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR EHD FLOW IN ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITORS
Stephen Jerome Trettel
New Prague High School, New Prague, Minnesota, United States

The force produced by specialized high voltage capacitors was first discovered in the 1920's, however its physical mechanism has yet to be identified. The objective of this research was to provide data on various aspects of force production, and develop a working theory to explain its operation.<br><br>The experiments analyzed the effects of electrode shape, size, separation, voltage and current on the force produced. A systematic procedure was developed to test each variable independently while allowing its effects to be easily compared to those of any other variable. It was hypothesized that the force was ionic in nature, dependent on the shape and strength of the electric field.<br><br>The force was measured by positioning the capacitor on an electronic banalce and recording the change in weight between the charged and uncharged states.Over 7000 individual data points were taken, and strong correlations between all variables and force were found.<br><br>These correlations provided a starting point for theoretical analysis. An analysis of ionic wind proved the effect to be over 3 orders of magnitude too small, and electrode ablation was shown to be unrealistic. Drift transport, an extension of ionic wind to fluid dielectric media, predicted force values close in correlation and magnitude to experimental values.<br><br>This technology has gerat potential in miniature propulsive applicatoins, due to the fact that the force is produced silently, and without moving parts. The basic research conducted in experimetns such as these brings this technology closer to application.

VARIATION IN STAR FORMATION RATE FROM GALAXY CLUSTER CENTER FOR CL1037
Emily Brook Petroff
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, United States

Galaxy clusters are large, gravitationally bound systems of 50 galaxies or more. The purpose of this study was to understand how the star formation rates of galaxies in a cluster change as a function of distance from the center; I studied cl 1037, a cluster at redshift 0.58. I predicted that galaxies closer to the center would have a higher star formation rate and the star formation rate would decrease as distance increased because there would be fewer mergers, which stimulate star formation, farther out. Star formation rates were calculated using 24?m luminosities from Spitzer Space Telescope data. It was found that star formation rate actually increases as a function of distance from the center of the cluster by .026 M/yr/kpc; However, the data did not fit the linear regression neatly, with an R2 of .11. A detailed analysis of possible pairs in the cluster was also done and 2 pairs were identified with some certainty, while another pair is hypothesized. Learning more about the star formation rates of galaxies in clusters at low redshift can help us to understand behavior of clusters at higher redshifts and further research would include a study of more clusters at low redshifts.

A NEW TECHNIQUE IN FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY: AN APPARATUS FOR OBSERVING AND QUANTIFYING CHLOROPHYLL AUTOFLUORESCENCE IN VIVO
George James Hansel
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, Connecticut, United States

The phenomenon of autofluorescence, the tendency of pigments naturally within the sample to fluoresce, is generally considered 'noise' and is minimized to the greatest extent possible so that only targeted dyes are imaged. However, for certain organisms, autofluorescence may be exploited for imaging and spectral observations not otherwise possible, provided appropriate apparatus is used. In this research, a fluorescence microscope was constructed to be capable of both epi-illumination and hypo-illumination using gas and diode laser and LED light sources. The addition of a fiber-optic light spectrometer facilitated collection of spectral data at extremely small scales as well as the traditional image data. Hypo-illumination by an argon-ion laser has enabled the imaging of chlorophyll and photosystem autofluorescence of organisms such as Euglena gracilis in vivo with high signal-to-noise ratios. With this apparatus, extremely dim chlorophyll autofluorescence was able to be seen with the naked eye through the microscope, and image data was easily collected with a conventional charge-coupled device. However, the distinguishing feature of the apparatus remains the ability to collect spectral data at high sensitivity with high signal-to-noise ratios on a microscopic scale of approximately 20 microns. Spectral data of extremely dim chlorophyll autofluorescence in vivo in the protist algae Euglena gracilis can be collected with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 25 dB.

MAGNETIC FIELD INFLUENCES ON VARIOUS FLUID VISCOSITIES
Bonnie LeeAnn White
Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, SC, USA

Electromagnetism has been found to ease the flow of oil through oil pipelines. It is theorized that the field induces nanometer scale paraffin particles to bunch into large particle groups, which reduces the oil’s viscosity. An experiment was performed using various fluids; some containing paraffin, some not; some polar, some nonpolar. The fluids were exposed to a magnetic field by running them through the center of an air-cooled solenoid. The time it took each fluid to run through the plastic tubing was recorded and the differences before and after magnetic field exposure samples were compared against each other.<br><br> A student’s t test with a significant p-value indicated that certain fluids reduce in viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field. A data-confounding factor was a rise in fluid temperature as the test progressed. Considering the specific heat of corn oil, there are clues that the magnetic field is influencing corn oil flow rate apart from temperature changes. A different setup needs to be used to eliminate the “heat” factor.<br><br>

Purpose: Measure the acceleration of local gravity using a reversible pendulum and compare it the accepted constant. <br><br>Procedure: First, a Reversible Kater’s Pendulum must be obtained. The Pendulum must be balanced by adjusting the adjustable weight at on end. Time it for 200 oscillations, then turn it over and time it for 200 oscillations and adjust the weight so that the times are equal on either end it swings. The exact distance between the knife-edges must be measured. With it balanced, Let it Oscillate 200 times and record the time. Divide the time by the number of oscillations to calculate for the individual oscillation. Repeat step five until an adequate number of results are obtained. Average the results by adding them together and dividing by the number of results.<br><br>You have measured the length of the pendulum, (L). You have measured the time of an oscillation, (T). Plug the results in the equation and solve for (g).<br><br> <br><br> T=2*pi*sqrt(L/g)<br><br> <br><br> g=L*(2*pi/T)^2<br><br> <br><br>Conclusion: My results were very consistent with the calculation for (g) being 9.801 meters per second squared plus or minus 0.0185 meters per second squared which was 0.001 away from the accepted average.

A STUDY OF THE MAGNETIC FIELDS UNDER THE DIAMAGNETIC REPULSION INFLUENCE OF THE MEISSNER-OCHENFELD EFFECT
Dan Mark Zortman
Dallastown Area High School, York, PA, United States of America

This experiment examined the Meissner-Ochenfeld Effect caused by the interaction of an external magnetic field with Type II Yttrium based superconductors. Results show that the amount of the magnetic field distortion due to the Meissner-Ochenfeld Effect is dependent upon the diameter of a circular superconductor as the height and width of the superconductor are left constant.<br><br>Two superconductors were maintained at their critical temperature. An electromagnet and a sensor passed along the length of each superconductor. The magnetic field from the electromagnet was measured by an active readout Gauss sensor and was recorded through a computer interface. The greatest change in the magnetic field was recorded at a max of 14 percent between the minimum of the change and the average magnetic field. This occurred as the sensor passed over the largest segment of the superconductor.<br><br>The magnetic field displacements showed a curved response with respect to the path over the superconductors. Field interactions along the spatial dimensions of a superconductor represent the connected variables of the Meissner-Ochenfeld Effect according to the relations between geometry of a perfect diamagnet and induced magnetic fields.<br><br>The orientations of the influenced magnetic field relate to the intermolecular lattice interactions of Cooper pairs and magnetism. The interaction investigates the macroscopic effect of the influenced fields (e.g., levitation), and the molecular scope of the quantum and mechanical interactions within the superconductor. Understanding the molecular scale effect is an important part of understanding the nature of superconductivity in this material, and in how to manipulate it.<br><br>

The purpose of this project was to construct a low-power inverted optical tweezers setup, to optimize the trap strength by maximizing the gradient force exerted on the particles, and to gauge the trapping efficiency by calculating the drag force exerted in all three dimensions when trapping and manipulating yeast cells in a fluid medium.<br><br>A 23mW red He-Ne laser was used. Plane mirrors reflected and steered the beam while spherical plano-convex lenses resized it. A 40x objective focused the beam onto the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope, creating an optical trap for the cells, enclosed in a 100 ìm-deep rose chamber. White illumination light passed through the rose chamber into a CCD camera, which was connected to a monitor for imaging.<br><br>To achieve optimal trapping, the gradient force was maximized by optimizing the intensity of the rays that entered the objective at the steepest possible angles. The laser beam’s intensity profile was measured, the width of the appropriate central component of the beam to enter the aperture of the objective was determined, and the beam was resized accordingly. Intensity losses were minimized through careful alignment procedures.<br><br>Yeast cells were successfully tweezed three- dimensionally. To measure the trap efficiency, the drag velocity in the xy-plane and the z-axis were calculated. To account for aberrations caused by refraction, an equation was created to model the distance the focus travels versus the distance the beam is steered for various angles of incidence. The drag force exerted was calculated.

SIMULATION OF LIGHT SCATTERING OF MITOCHONDRIA AFTER CELL APOPTOSIS
Norman Lai Pai
David H. Hickman High School, Columbia, MO, USA

This research aims to use light scattering to detect programmed cell death, or apoptosis, when malfunctions are tied to cancerous tumor growth. In apoptosis, the random distribution of mitochondria changes the cell’s light scattering properties. The mitochondria whose size is comparable to the near infrared light wavelength, will produce large angle scattering when the photons propagate in living cells. The purpose of this experiment is to develop a system that uses angular light intensity data to determine if a tissue sample was healthy. <br><br>Mie scattering analysis was conducted to model cell apoptosis in a turbid medium. The calculated light scattering revealed significant differences in angular intensity scattering patterns from various sized particles including 1 micron particles (mitochondria-sized) and 10 micron particles (cell-sized). Notably, small-angle intensity was high for larger particles, and large-angle intensity was greater from smaller particles. <br><br>In simulation, a goniometer setup was used to analyze polystyrene bead samples of 0.535, 0.989, 3.211, and 9.606 microns, in diameter, suspended in distilled water. Results yielded noticeable differences such as 0.535 and 0.989 micron beads produced more intense light scatter at angles greater than 30 degrees for 9.606 microns. Also, 3.211 micron beads produced more intense scatter than 9.606 microns at angles greater than 60 degrees.<br><br>These findings show large-angle scattering can be used to provide angular information in addition to depth resolved information of tissue apoptosis tested by optical coherence-domain imaging which uses the same light source and could complement other biomedical imaging systems for tissue diagnosis and monitoring.<br><br>

The Doppler effect is a general physics effect that set the relation between the frequency characteristics of wave sources of any nature with the velocity of the observer and of the source of these waves. In a school course of physics Doppler effect is considered theoretically using the examples from acoustics and optics but without actual demonstration. Therefore, we designed and assembled a modern experimental installation with the semi-conductor laser for studying the Doppler effect, with the subsequent measurements processing on a computer. The mechanical part of the installation (based on Michelson interferometer), as well as the electronic circuits and ADC, were developed independently. <br><br>The installation allows to solve the problems of astronomy, such as: measuring waveslengths and velocities of light sources in space, provided an eyepiece of a telescope were used instead of the laser.<br><br>

EUVUVU -- THE AIR MESSAGER

The Euvuvu, a bamboo blade connected to a string, was once used for message transfer by ancient Tsou aborigines in Ali Mountain, Taiwan. It is nowadays still used to announce the opening of the Fona Festival, the most important yearly event of Tsou aborigines.<br><br> The rotational states of a motor-driven Euvuvu are studied. Three distinguishable modes are found, each of which is associated with a particular pair of revolution and spinning of the slice. Clockwise spinning, counterclockwise spinning, and no spinning of the slice may be created. Sound is then produced by the spinning of the slice, since it continuously beats the air. The spin state directs the slice to revolve around the pivot point at a particular altitude. <br><br> In clockwise revolution, a clockwise spinning of the slice results in a revolution at an altitude that is higher than that of the counterclockwise spinning, which we believe is driven by the lifting force created by the clockwise spinning. Revolution at an intermediate altitude is found for the no-spinning state. Driven by the continuous twist of the string, automatic transitions between the clockwise and counterclockwise spinnings are seen, which results in changes in altitude of revolution plane as well. I find no direct transition between the spinning and no-spinning states. Surprisingly, the life-time of revolution follows nicely the inverse fourth power of the string diameter. Possible mechanisms will be discussed.<br><br>

SIMULATIONS OF GRAVITATIONAL MICROLENSING EVENTS INVOLVING NEARBY LENSES AND EFFECTS OF PARALLAX
Mary Masterman
Westmoore High School, Oklahoma City, OK USA

Microlensing occurs when the multiple images produced by a gravitational lens are not resolvable and the light from the source star is magnified for a short enough time that the event can be detected. The duration of the event is dependent on the mass, distance, and transverse velocity of the lens. In some microlensing events, parallax due to the orbit of the earth can change the position of the lens as seen from the earth, allowing more information about the lens to be extracted. In this project, the effects of parallax on microlensing events were considered using computer modeling, with a focus on very nearby events. Events were modeled in situations where the earth's orbital motion resulted in varying components of oscillation in the lens motion. It was found that for nearby lenses with an Einstein radius comparable to a few AU and very small velocities, the light curves of microlensing events could become completely dominated by parallax. In particular, some light curves were distinguished by such properties as having multiple peaks due to apparent repeated crossing of the source by the lens. Since the duration of these peaks is dependent on the velocity of the lens, it is proposed that in the future parallactic microlensing can be used as a valuable to partially break the degeneracy typically associated with microlensing and probe the nature of dim, nearby objects such as neutron stars or brown dwarfs.

To compensate for this, I have devised an experiment that uses low-level radioactive sources and a mock wall to simulate the effects of fallout from a nuclear explosion and to determine what building materials offer the most protection from fallout. <br><br> I believed that the brick would block 50% of the radiation, sheet metal 15%, wood 20%, glass 5%, and a standard roof 30%.<br><br> My independent variables are the outer wall, brick, wood, sheet metal, roof, and glass. To conduct my expieriment, I placed a radioactive source on the wall and took readings for 1 minute each, 5 times, and then changed the shielding material. After that was completed, I would change the radioactive source. The radioactive sources used were Cs-137, Co-57, Na-22, Mn-54, Eu-152, and an x-ray device with an output of 20 keV. <br><br> After conducting the experiment with the radioactive sources, The brick blocked 46% of the radiation, sheet metal blocked 5%, and wood blocked 6%. <br><br> The results from using the x-ray machine were as follows: wood 4%, glass 9%, wall 40%, standard roof 42%, sheet metal 71%, and brick 98%. The reason for this discrepency is that the energy emitted from the x-ray tube is 20 keV, whereas the 1st part was an average of radionuclides that emitted gamma waves from 100 kEV to 1.2 MeV. Because the x-rays were not as powerful, they had less penetrating ability through the materials. <br><br> Of the building materials tested, only brick offered significant amounts of radiation shielding. <br><br>

THE PLAUSIBILITY AND LIMITS OF A "COSMIC COMPASS" FOR DETERMINING THE UNIVERSAL POSITION AND RELATED TIME DERIVATIVES OF A SPACE VEHICLE, USING ENERGY-BASED TRILATERATION
David B. McMillon
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, Michigan, USA

This project was a successful examination of a highly contemporary invention known as the “cosmic compass.” This system consists of a very powerful electromagnetic detector. When attached to a space vehicle, the system applies universal trilateration, and is capable of pinpointing a space vehicle’s position and related time derivatives relative to a frame of reference anywhere in the universe. It is assembled in various ways based on the emission, locative, and fundamental properties of four or more celestial bodies.<br><br>The examination was conducted with three trials at each of three electromagnetic wavelengths: microwave, infrared, and visible light. The universal trilateration process was applied to locate a microwave receiver, phototransistor, and light probe according to defined reference frames, using the intensity of the respective emitters of the electromagnetic waves. The detectors represented space vehicles equipped with the "cosmic compass." With all three experiments successful, it was proven that the "cosmic compass" was plausible using any emitter within detectable range, and any electromagnetic wavelength. The study concluded with a formal proof and claims of the invention, and speculations for multiple trilaterations to determine the exact universal position of a space traveler to improve. <br><br> The "cosmic compass" is applicable in both modern and future space travel, and represents a significant step towards interstellar and intergalactic space navigation. The futuristic vibe of this scientific research project should be spread to scientists throughout the world; it is important for the scientific community to work towards the benefit of all mankind.<br><br>

ABLEABE ARMATURE-BASED LINEAR ELECTROMAGNETIC ACCELERATOR BALLISTICS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC
Anthony Michael Gulotta
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville VA, United States of America

Railguns operate by discharging a capacitor bank across two metal rails and through a projectile. This creates a Lorentz force which drives the projectile forward. However, because of the high voltages and currents needed to induce a powerful Lorentz force, the process creates a significant amount of heat. This results in rail erosion and projectile deformation, sometimes even to the extent that projectiles melt and fuse to the rails.<br><br> The strength of the forces at work also mean that even slight changes in projectile composition and design can have a large impact on velocity and efficiency. To test these properties and find a balance between them, an armature-switched, railgun-style linear electromagnetic accelerator was constructed and fired using a variety of projectiles. These firings were then used to calculate the average velocity produced with each of the projectiles.<br><br> The highest average velocity was achieved with a copper-backed notched teflon projectile. Teflon's vastly superior results, in relation to the solid aluminum slugs preferred by railgun designers, can be traced to the experimental device's low injection speed. Limited resources forced the design of the railgun used in this experiment to inject projectiles at a speed too low to eject the aluminum projectiles before they fused to the rails. However, this more accurately reflects the specifications of a potentially portable railgun, where the use of a full-sized compressor simply is not feasible. Despite their limitations, induction-based linear electromagnetic accelerators offer a sustainable, environmentally-friendly alternative to modern chemically-dependent accelerators.<br><br>

CALCIUM-SENSITIVE DYE IMAGING OF HYPER-SYNCHRONOUS NEURAL ACTIVITY IN THE RAT NEOCORTEX
Robert Deming Gilchrist
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, Missouri, USA

Fast experimental imaging is crucial to the understanding and perfection of models that emulate hyper-synchronous neural activity. Imaging using calcium-sensitive dyes provides the spatiotemporal resolutions necessary to visualize hyper-synchronous neural activity propagation for creation of an accurate neural model, but uptake of the dye in the adult rat neocortex in vivo is extremely difficult. Imaging using calcium-sensitive dye involved the use of anesthetized rats. Hyper-synchronous neural activity was induced using 4-aminopyridine, and electrophysiological properties were measured using a field potential electrode. FURA-2 calcium-sensitive dye was then topically introduced to neocortex and allowed to incubate. The cortex was then illuminated using light at wavelengths of 546nm and 630nm. 4-aminopyridine was introduced and induced hyper-synchronous activity. A CCD camera then imaged the activity and compared light reflectance and absorption with a raw image over a series of trials. Images produced proved no correlation to hyper-synchronous neural activity. The technique was modified, but yielded similar results. A neural model, however, was created that emulated predetermined spike patterns and neural synchronization in a more simplistic manner using non-linear dynamics techniques. Conclusively, this provides future scientists with evidence of the difficulty of introducing calcium-sensitive dye into the adult rat neocortex in vivo and lays an improvable framework for future calcium-sensitive dye research, as well as research for a more advanced neural model.

GALAXY CLUSTERS: THE LOCAL EFFECTS ON STAR SYNTHESIS
Zackery Joseph Schroeder
Grosse Pointe North High School, Grosse Pointe Woods, MI 48236

Did galaxies in the early universe produce stars at the same rate as galaxies today? What environmental factors affect the star formation rate of galaxies? Data at 24-micron wavelengths for three intermediate-redshift galaxy clusters taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope was acquired to derive the star formation rates (SFR) of the cluster galaxies. Imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) was acquired. The clusters differed in mass, degree of relaxation, and number of members. Physical properties such as morphology, VRIJK magnitudes, local density, and presence of merging galaxies were analyzed in order to correlate how factors in the internal and external environment of clusters affect SFR. The cluster galaxies were also compared to field galaxies. The SFRs of the clusters were compared to other redshift studies to provide a more complete picture of how the SFR of galaxies has changed over time. The SFRs of all galaxies were affected by their morphologies, color index, and presence of starburst. Also, galaxies within clusters tended to have lower SFRs overall compared to those in the field. Density within the cluster, dark matter, and ram-pressure stripping played a role in the difference between cluster and field galaxy SFR. When comparing the SFRs of clusters at 3 different redshifts, there is a large increase in SFR at intermediate redshifts.

PERIOD ANALYSIS OF CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE X10 AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON THE ORIGIN OF LOW STATES
Temple Mu He
Troy High School, Troy, MI, USA

Cataclysmic variables are binary systems, each consisting of a white dwarf (the primary) and a low mass star (the secondary). Usually, matter flows from the secondary onto the primary, producing X-rays upon impact. However, previous observations have indicated that certain cataclysmic variables frequently exhibit low states – a dramatic decrease in mass transfer (and thus X-ray production) for an extended period of time. Low states can last up to several years, and this phenomenon is currently not well understood. This research is primarily focused on creating a model to elucidate the origin of low states using data gathered from X10, a magnetic cataclysmic variable that experienced a low state in year 2005. The model proposed in this study attributes low states to the magnetic interactions between the secondary’s starspots and the primary, and its predictions on which systems should exhibit low states and which ones should not have all been confirmed by past observations.

A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF TROPOSPHERIC DUCTING ON A FORWARD SCATTER METEOR RADAR DETECTION SYSTEM
Channing Jordan Arnold
Booneville High School, Booneville MS, United States

The Earth is constantly bombarded with ice, dust, and rocks from outer space. When these particles enter the atmosphere, they become meteors. These particles can potentially damage satellites, the space shuttle, or the International Space Station. Therefore, it is important for scientists to understand meteor activity in order to protect the man-made objects orbiting the earth. This project has studied meteor activity over the southeastern United States for the past 3 years using a forward scatter meteor radar detection system. During the summer and fall months of 2006, the meteor counts were much lower than the previous years. The purpose of this project was to use statistical analysis to determine if high barometric pressure associated with tropospheric ducting could be the cause of the decreased meteor counts.<br><br> During very warm weather with high barometric pressure, weak TV signals from distant transmitters can improve in signal strength. This can often occur during the summer and fall months. Since a forward scatter meteor radar detection system depends on weak signals from a distant TV station, this could cause the meteor counts to be greatly reduced. Hourly barometric pressure data was obtained for the summer and fall months from 2004-2006 and matched with the corresponding hourly meteor counts. A statistical analysis was done to determine if there was a correlation between barometric pressure and meteor counts for every hour of the day.<br><br> The analysis showed evidence of a weak correlation between the barometric pressure and meteor counts. The strongest correlation occurred between 22:00 UT and 6:00 UT. More years of data will need to be collected and analyzed in order to make a definitive connection between high barometric pressure and the change in meteors detected.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY ON THE EQUATION OF TIME
Nicholas Elden Allen
Northridge High School, Layton, UT, USA

The purpose of this project was to improve sunrise predictions of the Equation of Time by accounting for the delay caused by the shadowing effect of the Wasatch Mountains.<br><br> Latitude, longitude, and elevation data for many points along the ridge of the mountain were taken first from paper and later from online topographical maps from www.usgs.gov. This data was combined with corresponding topographical data for a pre-determined observation site. A table was created to express the profile of the mountain by giving the mountain elevation angle as a function of azimuth angle with respect to the observation site.<br><br> A spreadsheet algorithm was developed to solve for time by equating the two parametric equations representing the sun’s rise over the mountain:<br><br> solar elevation (time, location) = mountain elevation (solar azimuth (time, location))<br><br>where location refers to the latitude and longitude of the observation site, and solar elevation and azimuth are calculated using known formulas. To check the accuracy of the improved sunrise time predictions, sunrise time at the observation site was recorded over a one year period. <br><br> It was found that the improved sunrise equation generated results within 5 minutes of the sunrise observations versus the Equation of Time which generated results within 1 hour and 11 minutes. The method used in this project could improve sunrise predictions for any location, given the appropriate topographical data. <br><br> Applications of this project include solar power feasibility studies, agricultural insolation studies, accident investigations, and long-term personal planning.<br><br>

ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND ENERGY EFFICIENT HB LED LIGHT BULB
Trevor M. Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, Utah, USA

Incandescent bulbs provide good lighting but they are inefficient and generate a lot of heat. Fluorescent bulbs are replacing incandescent, but fluorescent bulbs require several seconds to warm up, are very expensive, and contain environmentally sensitive materials like mercury. Energy efficient high-bright light-emitting-diodes (HB LEDs) have recently found their way into flashlights, and this prompted the idea that HB LEDs could be used to construct a 120 volt AC light bulb for experimentation and comparison.<br><br> This project tested if a HB LED bulb could produce as much light as an incandescent while using less energy than a fluorescent. To prove the hypothesis, a HB LED light circuit was designed, constructed, and tested with two different meters. The first meter measured voltage, current, wattage, and power factor. The second meter measured the light output in lux and foot-candles. Incandescent and fluorescent bulbs were also tested and compared for the same parameters. The data was recorded in a table for analysis. The HB LED light bulb configuration was also changed and tested using colored HB LEDs and flicker-fused bi-color LEDs to match the color of an incandescent bulb while keeping the energy consumption at or below the level of a fluorescent bulb.<br><br> The HB LED light bulb developed for this project is environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The HB LED bulb does not contain environmentally sensitive materials, requires less energy, and is therefore superior to both incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs. HB LED light bulbs will be common in the near future.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND RADIATION AND HAWKING RADIATION ON THE MASS OF A SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE
Taylor M Sullivan
Hamilton High School (Chandler, AZ)

This research project creates a realistic model for a Schwarzschild black hole which is only subjected to Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and Hawking Radiation effects. A mathematical expression was derived from basic equations describing flux, cooling, and the temperature and radius of a black hole. The expression derived was determined to be a differential equation in an unsolvable form, forcing the entire algorithm to be approximated using a finite sum. Euler’s method was utilized, with about a half million calculations per model. This mathematical process was then used to model multiple black holes with a variety of initial masses and times of formation. The massive quantity of calculations required to simulate one black hole limited research to 77 types of black holes. Select data points were extracted from each simulation and were used for data analysis. Analysis of the simulations revealed multiple characteristic behaviors of black holes, including two points of equilibrium and a minimum mass for exponential expansion— trends which appeared to depend upon the black hole’s initial masses. Also, black holes were analyzed based on their varying formation times. The information ultimately concluded upon was then used to backup/reaffirm pre-existing evidence regarding the formation of galaxies.

THE LINK BETWEEN FLUID TURBULENCE AND SYNCHRONIZED CHAOTIC SYSTEMS
Brandon John Campbell
Fremont High School, Plain City, Utah, United States

Turbulence in fluid systems disappears at small scales, but this phenomenon is not well understood. It has been theorized by Kolmogoroff that this behavior is the result of viscous damping, but this project suggests a better alternative. The disappearance of turbulence at small scales could be the result of internal communication. The Lorenz equations are an approximation of fluid convection and are well known as a chaotic system. It is also well known that communicating chaotic systems may synchronize. Small scale eddies would be suppressed by chaotic synchronization within the fluid.<br><br> Data was collected from communicating Lorenz systems. Signal strength was varied and resulting correlation was measured. There is a critical value at which the systems become synchronized. Below this value, the systems are independent. This critical value suggests a relationship with the critical distance that limits eddy radius. <br><br>Eddy radius and population within a convective fluid system were measured and plotted. Eddies of many sizes were apparent but vanish suddenly at a critical scale. Viscous damping should result in a gradual decline in eddy size. This evidence suggests a connection between chaotic synchronization and the absence of small eddies in a viscous fluid.<br><br>

LIGHTNING IN THE LABORATORY: ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM RED SPRITES
Sarah Lynn McCuskee
Campbell Collegiate, Regina SK, Canada

Sprites, transient luminous phenomena in the mesosphere related to lightning, are an electrodeless glow discharge. The purpose of this research was to produce sprite-like phenomena in a glow discharge tube and study electromagnetic emissions from VLF to UHF and the electrical processes involved. <br><br>A 30 mT laboratory vacuum chamber and a 3600 volt DC power supply were used with DC current restricted to less than 30 mA. The glow discharge tube exhibited nitrogen first positive (red) and negative (blue) emissions characteristic of sprites. Sprite electromagnetic emissions have only been studied at ~1 kHz, however this research measured ~15 dB increase in noise levels above background in the frequency spectrum of 0.1 to 20 MHz and ~5 dB between 200 and 300 MHz. The electromagnetic field intensity at 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz, in relation to DC current, exhibited similar characteristics. Measurements of transient currents in the DC excited tube showed ~8 A, oscillating, quasi-periodic current pulses. Investigations of capacitive discharges revealed ~3000 A transients. Waveforms immediately prior to these transients are very similar to stepped leader development in lightning flashes, which likely involves a runaway electron breakdown mechanism. <br><br>It was concluded that physical, electrical, and electromagnetic properties of sprites and glow discharge tubes are similar. Glow discharge tubes also show evidence of transient phenomena. Both the runaway breakdown and quasi-electrostatic field models for sprite formation are supported. Glow discharge tubes, therefore, are applicable to sprite research. <br><br>

ON THE PROPULSIVE LEIDENFROST PHENOMENON: EXPLORATION OF THEORY, EXPERIMENT, AND APPLICATIONS
Nilesh Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, CA , U.S.A

The Leidenfrost phenomenon occurs when a liquid in contact with a sufficiently hot mass produces an insulating vapor layer which supports the liquid itself. However the presence of asymmetrical surface geometries has been recently shown to influence the vapor flow resulting in a net force being exerted on the liquid. A series of theoretical developments and experiments were formulated to characterize and explain this novel behavior, in addition to investigating its heat transfer characteristics.<br><br> To geometrically characterize the vapor flow domain a DSLR camera with a self-constructed Fourier optics system was used to obtain images of the Leidenfrost droplets. These images were mathematically analyzed using MATLAB to approximate the height of the vapor layer. A similar approach was used to determine the pressure gradient based on extrapolations from local droplet curvatures. These values were then meshed with a self-derived parallel-plate slip flow model.<br><br> A mathematical model describing heat flux within the substrate and vapor layer was developed based on the solution to a specific case of the 3-D heat equation. In conjunction, fine-wire thermocouples and computer-assisted data collection were used to experimentally corroborate theoretical temperature distributions.<br><br> The adaptation of the Navier-Stokes’ equations to account for micro-scale rarefaction effects led to better agreement between experimental and theoretical predictions of heat transfer. In addition, some of the unexpected results such as the high heat transfer coefficient can be explained by the micro-scale phenomena. Leidenfrost systems offer a natural manifestation of ‘micro-channels’ which may lead to their usage in novel, self-actuated, heat-dissipators.<br><br>

This project compares the original architects’ plans of the World Trade Center to those of my own design. My idea was to make plans that would compete for structural integrity and safety with those of an architect and a structural engineer. I built scale models of my plan and the original plan and exposed them to various weights and stresses to determine their structural integrity. I determined that the phrase” simplicity is better” is actually true. The design of Leslie Robinson was simple but contained many complex angles used for structural support. My design on the other hand, was straight forward and supported more weight and stress than the original used for the Trade Center.<br><br>

INTERFEROMETRIC INTRIGUE
Laura Elizabeth McCauley
Clover Park High School, Lakewood, WA, U.S.

The purpose of this project was to determine whether a change in the environment through which the laser beam of the interferometer passes would impact the fringe pattern produced by the interferometer. The small-scale Michelson Interferometer that was constructed is a sensitive device that measures the interference patterns produced when a beam of monochromatic light is separated, reflected off two separate mirrors, and then recombined. The fringe patterns produced reflect the interaction of the two separated light waves as a result of the environmental conditions around them. This experiment tests the effect of steam on the interferometer’s image fringes. The hypothesis states that passing the laser beam through steam will produce different fringe patterns from those produced by the beam in a normal ambient environment. <br><br> The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis; the steam did indeed cause a fluctuation in the fringe patterns. The average number of fringes counted without the steam was 3.5, while the average of fringes with the steam was 15.3. <br><br> This increase in fringe activity can possibly be explained by the hotter air through which the beam passed or the refractive properties of the small water molecules in the steam. Familiar comparisons would include a mirage where radiant heat distorts the visible atmosphere, or a rainbow where water drops split sunlight into the frequencies of the visible light spectrum. Similarly, passing the laser beam through steam distorts the fringe pattern and impacts the trial results by changing the fringe pattern and producing greater fringe activity. <br><br>

TOWARD A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION: WEALTH DYNAMICS FOR VARYING SAVINGS PROPENSITIES IN A CLOSED MARKET
Will Rowan Fletcher
Hellgate High School, Missoula, MT 59802

An agent based model of a closed market from the econo-physics literature (Patriarca et al (2004) Physica A 340:344) was reviewed and implemented in Matlab. This model assumes a uniform distribution of wealth initially. Pairs of randomly selected individuals split money in a common pool according to a random variable. Individuals contribute according to a predefined savings propensity. Published models were then extended with the assignment of a non-uniform distribution of savings propensities to the population of agents.<br><br> <br><br>Published and extended models were used to model the actual wealth distribution for a number of countries. It was found that a uniform savings propensity could adequately simulate many nations, but non-uniform distribution of the agents’ savings propensities allowed a superior fit to all countries, particularly those with highly inequitable distributions of wealth. Following this, a simulation was created to test a number of economic policies on the wealth distribution of the United States. Multiple taxation and redistribution plans were employed, and the policies’ effects on the concentration of wealth were determined by tracking the Gini indices. All combinations of taxation and redistribution plans increased the equity in the system, but the policies’ effectiveness varied significantly and did not produce a lasting change. It was found that the sales tax yielded the smallest benefit and the most progressive tax yielded the largest.<br><br> <br><br>Netlogo was identified as a superior platform for agent based modeling. This platform has allowed for rapid exploration of scenarios involving more detailed interactions between agents and their environment.

A UNIFICATION OF GRAVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
Maxwell Lipford Hutchinson
Mt. Lebanon High School, Pittsburgh PA, USA

This study attempts to unify electromagnetism and gravity at the macroscopic level by establishing symmetry between the static and relativistic forces with respect to charge and mass. The process yields a mass-oriented analogue of magnetism and a mathematical simplification of the known forces. The perihelion precession of Mercury, on which the hypothesized force has an effect, is analyzed using a Fortran program. The force law is validated through comparison of observed and expected rates of precession. Because of the accuracy of input data and the nature of the programs utilized, the results are inconclusive. <br><br> The nature of forces, mass, and charge are then discussed. Charge is found to be inertial, bolstering the symmetry between charge and mass. Applications of this symmetry to energy result in new definitions for static and relativistic energies of masses and charges and a relationship relating mass and theoretical radius. The problem of the Lorentz factor and the differences between gravitational and inertial mass are explained. Finally, a number of extensions and tests for the theories presented are offered.<br><br>

CHAOS IN A DRIPPING FAUCET
Aaron Thomas Criss
The Learning Community International, Columbia, MD, United States of America

The purpose of the experiment was to create the chaotic system of a dripping faucet and perform analysis to find order and patterns in the data.<br><br> The average drop rate was adjusted primarily by changing the pressure at the nozzle by varying the height between the faucet and the water level in a reservoir. A microphone was placed under the faucet so that the drops would hit it and bounce off. After recording the impact of the drops on the microphone, the sound file was passed to a program written by the researcher. That program went through the sound file, detected the drops, and calculated the time differences between successive drops.<br><br> These time differences were passed to the second program the researcher wrote. This program performed many different kinds of analysis including histograms, autocorrelations, and two and three dimensional return maps. Finally, the program performed a non-linear auto regression which fitted the data to non-linear combinations of the previous points. The program tried various numbers of previous terms and different powers of the terms and cross terms. The best combination was identified based on the correlation between the predicted and actual data. <br><br> By analyzing other data sets, including widely known or mathematically generated data sets, the researcher determined that the analysis performed was valid. The analysis was able to find order and evidence of nonlinearity in the experimental data.<br><br> Analysis of this type could be useful in data compression or cryptanalysis.<br><br>

A COUPLED OSCILLATOR MODEL FOR GROVER'S QUANTUM DATABASE SEARCH ALGORITHM
Aavishkar Apoorva Patel
National Public School, Rajajinagar, Bangalore-560010, Karnataka, India

Grover's database search algorithm is the optimal algorithm for finding a desired object from an unsorted collection of items. Although it was discovered in the context of quantum computation, it is simple and versatile enough to be implemented using any physical system that allows superposition of states, and several proposals have been made in the literature. I study a mechanical realisation of the algorithm using coupled simple harmonic oscillators, and construct its physical model for the simplest case of four identical oscillators. The identification oracle is implemented as an elastic reflection of the desired oscillator, and the overrelaxation operation is realised as evolution of the system by half an oscillation period. I derive the equations of motion, and solve them both analytically and by computer simulation. I extend the ideal case analysis and explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to changes in the initial conditions, masses of springs and damping. The amplitude amplification provided by the algorithm enhances the energy of the desired oscillator, while running the algorithm backwards spreads out the energy of the perturbed oscillator among its partners. The former (efficient focusing of energy into a specific oscillator) can have interesting applications in processes that need crossing of an energy threshold for completion, and can be useful in nanotechnological devices and catalysis. The latter (efficient redistribution of energy) can be useful in processes requiring rapid dissipation of energy, such as shock-absorbers and vibrational shielding. I present some tentative proposals.

My project was to discover if water could be a better agent of protection, compared to air, for the Mars Rover Landing Apparatus. I chose this because I have had an interest in research related to our planet and what is beyond. So I decided to do my project on something I have always been interested in, something out of this world, literally.<br><br>My experiment was done by building and experimenting on the airbag landing apparatus. I was curious to find out if water, containing a special antifreeze, would be a better shock absorber, upon impact, than air. I began by making the two tetrahedron shaped landers out of cardboard. I then inserted an egg in each and attached sixteen balloons to each apparatus. The control landing apparatus contained balloons with air, and experimental landing apparatus had water with antifreeze. <br><br>Once they were constructed,I began experimentation. I released the landers from measured elevations. I began at one meter, then went to two, three, four, and finished with five meters. This was the highest possible height I could reach in my school. <br><br>I discovered that both the water and the air are excellent media for use in the landing apparatus airbags. My egg was well protected and showed no signs of damage, at five meters, for both the experimental and the control group. I would like to further my experiment by testing a ploymer to see if that could serve as a better media of protection for the landing apparatus airbags. I would also like to test all three airbag media at much higher elevations.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

SAVE THE SPACE STUFF! PREDICTING PROTON EMISSIONS TO HELP OUR SATELLITES, ASTRONAUTS, AND AIRPLANES
Sophia Marie Mitchell
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the flux of protons hitting our planet in the following solar wind for each type of solar flare in order to develop a means to predict proton fluxes from observing emergence of solar flares. This topic is extremely important, because such proton fluxes have been known to knock out cell phones, radios, satellites (such as weather satellites and GPS systems) and power grids, along with creating a dangerous radiation environment for high flying aircraft (such as air force and navy jets) and astronauts. <br><br>The procedure utilized an online source to obtain recent data on solar flare sizes and the associated proton fluxes for approximately 1 year and 4 months. The data was then sorted into solar flare sizes, and then the distribution of proton fluxes for each solar flare category was tabulated. The variances (difference from the mean) in the distributions of proton fluxes for each solar flare category were calculated and plotted. As a result, the average proton flux and the breadth of distribution about the average were determined for each solar flare category. These results provide a predictive tool for estimating the proton flux resulting from any solar flare, along with a measure of the uncertainty of that estimate.<br><br>This project produced several conclusions. It was found that flares of type AO, B1, and B2 occurred most often and had the least amount of variance. On the other hand, while A2 flares occurred almost as often, it had a much wider variance leading to less predictable proton fluxes. Overall, most of the flare categories show narrow variances about their average proton fluxes, leading to good predictability of proton fluxes for most flare events. However this sample did not include any of the rare very high flux solar flares that occur perhaps once per 11-year solar cycle. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIOLOGICAL PHOTONIC CRYSTAL
Lauren Rose Richey
Springville High School, Springville Utah, USA

There exist a number of examples in nature where the color of an observed biological system arises from the interaction of visible light with some periodic structure in the specimen. Such structures, also known as photonic crystals, are three dimensional periodic materials with feature sizes roughly equivalent to the wavelength of visible light. Periodic structures diffract light according to the Bragg equation, leading to regions of the spectrum being forbidden from propagating through the material in certain directions.<br><br>The Lamprocyphus Augustus and Lamprocyphus Germari beetles, weevils native to South America, exhibit bright green/gold iridescence over the entire exoskeleton. Closer examination using optical microscopy revealed that the exoskeleton surface is covered with oval leaf shaped scales approximately 200 square microns in area, each individually similar in appearance to the observed color of the beetle. Optical characterization of the scales revealed that they were strongly reflecting, with a broad peak reflectance around 550 nm. <br><br>In order to determine the origin of the color observed in the scales, several techniques were used to expose the interior, including glass knives and an ultra-microtome. Subsequent imaging using SEM revealed an alternating pattern of layered hexagonal and cubic features. Quantitative image measurements were obtained using ImageJ. In general, the spacing between features was approximately 250 nm – 300 nm. There is good agreement between the observed peak reflectance and the predicted peak maximum according to the Bragg diffraction equation using the obtained feature spacing measurements, confirming the color observed arises from the internal photonic crystal structure.<br><br>

ANATOMY OF AN ACCIDENT (PHYSICS APPLIED) PHASE II
Tamara June Parliament
Hamlin High School, Hayti, South Dakota, USA

This investigation compared isolated components of vehicular collisions which influence vehicle occupants. These factors, specifically momentum and g-force are vital in understanding how passengers sustain injury during collisions. Simulated accident scenarios were analyzed to demonstrate the importance of seatbelts during an accident.<br><br> Simulated values, from last year’s investigation, were re-calculated using a corrected formulas to isolate each singular force. Comparison was made between forces being transferred to passengers when wearing a seatbelt verses when not. In each accident scenario, accepted weight for each vehicle was 3500 lbs/1587.6 k, and accepted passenger weights were 145lbs/65.8k (female) and 185lbs/83.9k (male). <br><br> In comparison of momentums during sudden negative acceleration, we observe Newton’s first law: an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force. In every vehicular collision, the “object” is the passenger and the “external force” is either the dashboard of the vehicle or the occupant’s seatbelt. Calculated force of momentum was used to determine the g-forces imposed upon the occupant’s body. It was determined that differing speeds, city (25-35), hwy (45-55) and interstate (65-75) greatly affect the amount of g-forces placed on the passenger’s body. <br><br> This investigation confirmed the necessity of safety restraints in a vehicle in as much as they reduced the force transfer experienced by the passenger by 99%. The investigation focused on more exact calculation of energy management resulting from proper use of safety belt restraining systems. The ultimate goal is interpretation of these calculations for application to design enhancement of restraint systems. <br><br>

SELECTION OF POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROIDS BY CALCULATING DIAMETERS AND PLOTTING ORBITAL PATTERNS TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE IMPACTS WITH THE EARTH
Ashley Dawn Brendal
Big Sky High School, Missoula, Montana, United States

The Main Asteroid Belt is a region between Mars and Jupiter where the majority of asteroids are located. Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, PHAs, can be credible threats to the Earth; and therefore should be a subject of priority in astronomical research. There are two main types of PHAs; the C- type (carbonaceous) and the S- type (stony). <br><br>A list of 800 PHAs was obtained and narrowed down to 221 by inclination. An originally derived equation involving albedo and absolute visual magnitude was utilized to calculate the diameters of the 221 asteroids. Fifteen asteroids were randomly chosen for further study. Seven orbits were hand plotted. The semi major and minor axis, node, eccentricity, aphelion, perihelion, and Vernal Equinox were all used in the plotting of the orbits.<br><br>The Line of Nodes and the Earth and Asteroid (99942) Apophis’ orbits cross at a single point, signifying possible impact. Apophis’ orbit was plotted again using an enlarged scale. Through further examination, a possible impact date was determined and potential crater diameter was calculated. The possible impact date was found to be April 14 on any given Earth year. An ephemeris was generated for Apophis to determine the year of close approach as 2029. An exact impact is not expected due to the delta and R values. Hypothetically, the energy of possible impact and crater diameter was approximated by estimating approach velocities (10-30 km/s) and using the possible C- and S- type composition, concluding that a crater may form anywhere between 8-19 km in diameter. <br><br>

A novel approach was used to fuse light Deuterium nuclei using an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion reactor. The production of a neutron flux enabled research to be done detecting materials using neutron activation analysis. Experiments done in gamma ray spectroscopy using scintillation detectors enabled indium to be analyzed from a distance. <br><br>Neutron sources have many uses including national security, and in medicine. They can be used to remotely detect explosives, fissile material, and can possibly be used to treat cancer. <br><br>Not only the reactor, but most of the associated electronics and detectors used had to be designed and built. A magnetron ion source was designed and used to increase the efficiency of the reactor.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF SHAKEN WET AND DRY GRANULAR MATERIALS
Shannon Marie MacKenzie
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills Kentucky, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to study the effect of adding various amounts of water to a mixture of two sizes of spherical beads. Two sides of a Plexiglas container each held distributed mixtures of 15 g of colored 7 mm purple beads and 45 g of clear 1.4 to1.6 mm. To one side, water was added in increments of 2, 3, and 4 microliters. The container was then oscillated vertically by a massager for ten minutes. Pictures were taken before and after shaking. Mixed and segregated zones resulted. There was a statistically significant difference between the average areas of mixed zones for all the wet runs when compared to the corresponding dry zones. The areas where there was mixing were greater for the wet beads than for the dry beads. The average fractions of the total area that was mixed ranged from 0.608 to 0.663 for the wet samples and averaged 0.494 for the dry runs.

ZERO GRAVITY PROPULSION USING ELECTRON EMISSIONS FROM CATHODE RAYS: THEORY PRESENTED THROUGH MACROSCOPIC TESTING
Timothy Isaac Christopher Fisher
Jefferson High School, Shenandoah Junction, WV, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to suggest that a propulsion system could be developed that would expel electrons as its principle fuel source and possibly recollected them while maintaining a net positive force.<br><br> To test this idea, a steel ball with a mass of 8.38 grams was fired by a spring though a copper pipe, diverted back toward the "ship" by a half circle pipe and struck a collection module on the frame of the "ship." The firing pin, running perpendicular through the copper pipe, was pulled out by an expansion spring when released by the motor. The motor was activated when a wireless phone connected to the relay's coil was paged.<br><br> The "ship's" tracks rested on four ball bearings. The bearings rested on a leveled sheet of glass. When fired, the "ship" did not move. The math supporting the hypothesis was flawed; momentum was conserved within the system. The force of thrust from the ball being discharged was cancelled out by the force exerted on the curve as the ball decelerated to zero relative to x. The ball then accelerated in the positive x-direction, exerting a negative force on the “ship.” That force was canceled out when the ball again decelerated to zero as it struck the collection module. This ended in a net force equal to zero<br><br> To test if electrons could be expelled from a CRT and not recollect, a cathode ray tube was made from a thin lamp bulb and a flashlight bulb. It was designed to trap electrons in a chamber between two anodes, one of which was insulated. A double pole switch, working in conjunction with relays, would then reverse the charges on the insolated anode while neutralizing the other. The combination of negative charges would force the electrons out of the system, where they would be detected by a spark gap. The circuitry worked, but the vacuum pump could not pull a strong enough vacuum to test the system.

INCREASING MAGNETIC FIELD OF ELECTROMAGNET BY LOWERING TEMPERATURE
Oliver Bar-rom Jeong
West High School, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

The electromagnet is used in a motor to produce mechanical power. However, the efficiency is limited by the resistive heat loss in the wire. To increase the power output, the size of the motor and/or the applied voltage is typically increased, which leads to the increase in heat dissipation and thus further limits the mechanical power. This project optimized the magnetic field per dissipated heat by lowering temperature of the electromagnet and minimizing heat dissipation. An increase in magnetic field of a solenoid was measured by lowering temperature or increasing voltage. A total of 3 experiments were performed. (1) The temperature of the solenoid was reduced using liquid nitrogen (LN2) with the fixed voltage. (2) The voltage was varied with temperature and resistance fixed by immersing the solenoid into the ice water. For experiments (1) and (2), resistive heat loss was calculated from the measured values of voltage and resistance. The relationships between the resistive heat and the magnetic field were quadratic and linear for voltage and temperature variations, respectively. (3) The solenoid was immersed into LN2 and the current was supplied for 20 minutes to measure the resistive heat by measuring the amount of the evaporated LN2; for a voltage, doubled voltage, and zero voltage for calibration. Doubling the voltage led to quadrupling the evaporation thus reemphasizing the results of the second experiment. The greatly reduced heat loss was observed by lowering the temperature compared to increasing voltage for the same magnetic field.

TEEN BUZZ
Emily Pauline Davidson
Lausanne Collegiate School, Memphis, Tennessee, United States

This study examined teenager’s and adult’s ability to hear high frequency “Teen Buzz” ring tones, also known as “The Mosquito” and “The Buzz”. The project is based on previous research that human hearing diminishes with age, especially for high frequencies. Thus, ring tones above some critical frequency may not be perceived by adults. <br><br>Hearing for twelve high frequency tones that varied from 8,000 to 22,735 Hz was tested in 40 adult (26-40 years) and 40 teenage (13-25 years) subjects. The interval between tones varied from 2 to 8 seconds to avoid false responses. A computer presented each tone for two seconds at the same loudness level to earphones. Subjects were instructed to indicate when a tone was perceived; the examiner recorded “heard” or “not heard”. An equal number of male and female subjects participated and were eliminated if they had noise exposure or ear-related medical conditions.<br><br>Results showed that adults do not perceive high frequency tones as well as teenagers; findings consistent with previous research. Only 32.5 percent of the adult group heard the lowest five frequencies, while 100 percent of the teenage group did. When frequency increased until no adults could hear, 25 percent of teenagers could still perceive. Adults showed sharp decline in hearing capability, dropping below 50 percent after the 4th highest frequency, while teenagers did not drop below 50% until the 9th highest frequency. <br><br>Results suggest one major conclusion. There is a significant difference (p<.001) between teenagers and adults in hearing capability for telephone buzz tones. <br><br>

COMPARISON OF MEASUREMENTS OF SEPARATION AND POSITION ANGLE OF BINARY STARS USING IMAGES FROM THE CCD NASA CAM AND CCD NURO CAM OF THE NURO TELESCOPE
Eframir Franco-Diaz
Petra Mercado Bougart, Humacao, Puerto Rico

The measurement of position angle and separation of binary stars is the key to determine the orbit and mass of these systems. The hypothesis is that the separation and position angle measurements of binary stars will be more accurate with the recent CCD NASA CAM than with the previous CCD NURO CAM of the NURO Telescope. The binary stars chosen for this research were of type “neglected” from the Washington Double Star Catalog. Stars with no apparent movement since more than fifty years were selected from within these neglected systems. To obtain these measurements, images of these systems were taken using CCD cameras. During this research, two different models of this type of camera were used at the facilities of the NURO telescope in Flagstaff, AZ: the recent CCD NASA CAM and the previous CCD NURO CAM. After these images were taken with both cameras, various computer softwares were used to calibrate, pixealize and take the negative of each one. In each resulting image, the position angle between a pair of stars was measured; the separation was measured and calculated using the Pythagoras’s Theorem. All this data was collected and compared between the resulting images of each camera. After comparing these results, it was concluded that even though the field of vision of the CCD NASA CAM (16 x 16 arcsec) is wider than the field of vision of the CCD NURO CAM (4 x 4 arcsec), both cameras are equally precise.

THAT FLOCKING CONVECTION
Atticus Bergman
Fairview High School, Boulder CO, USA

Using the approach of complex systems research, a system of particles is modeled in such a way that they self-organize to produce emergent structures similar to turbulent dry convection in the Earth’s planetary boundary layer. A preliminary model was created in which the rules of particle interaction were directly motivated from a bird flocking model designed by Craig Reynolds. This model proved to be inefficient and numerically unstable. Both problems were fixed through the invention and implementation of nodes, which allow for greater control over the nonlinearity of the system. With the introduction of nodes, particles self-organized into easily recognizable eddies and convective plumes. Structure cohesiveness reacts realistically to changes in Rayleigh number. The large value of eddy diffusivity is consistent with other boundary layer models, and the power law, calculated from the energy spectrum, appears to be –5/3, indicating the presence Kolmogorov turbulence.

THE EFFECT OF SNOW DENSITY ON THE SPEED OF A SKI
Elizabeth Magnussen DiMascio
Braintree High School, Braintree, Massachusetts, United States

This study was conducted to determine how snow density affects the speed of a ski. The relationship found between snow density and ski speed shows that ski speed increases as common snow densities increase. The measurement of the coefficient of friction of a ski on a range of snow densities supported this data.<br><br>Ski speed was tested by releasing a ski on a 15-degree incline, allowing it to travel 15.25 meters, and measuring its time using a stopwatch. Snow density was tested by finding mass and volume of a sample of snow. The lowest tested density of 0.24 g/mL resulted in the lowest speed of 3.05 ± 0.13 m/s. The highest tested density of 0.48 g/mL resulted in the highest speed of 3.67 ± 0.08 m/s.<br><br>Coefficients of friction (ì) were measured for the ski and three different snow densities. This was done using force calibrators and weights from 2.5 kg up to 8 kg. On a graph of force of friction versus normal force, the slopes of the three trend lines represent ì. The lowest tested density of 0.28 g/mL resulted in the highest coefficient of 0.15. The highest tested density of 0.40 g/mL resulted in the lowest coefficient of 0.02.<br><br>The results of this experiment show that (for common snow densities) as density increases, speed increases. The most pertinent application of this project is on freestyle skiing, in which it is imperative that competitors travel at a speed that will not force them to over- or under-rotate.<br><br>

DETERMINING SURFACE COMPOSITIONS OF KUIPER BELT OBJECTS THROUGH SPECTRUM MATCHING
Morielle Mathanja Stroethoff
Hellgate High School, Missoula, Montana, USA

In the outer reaches of the Solar System a large number of small icy bodies orbit the Sun. These objects, called the Kuiper Belt Objects, are the objects in the Solar System that are the most primitive and the least effected by heat. Although numerous studies on these objects have been made in the past few years, mostly about their orbital characteristics, studies of the composition of these objects have been limited by the faintness of the light reflected from them. Spectrum matching is a technique used to determine the surface composition of objects that are too faint to display obvious spectral features. In this study, 53 possible mixtures for the composition of the Kuiper Belt Objects were used to compare spectral data of the objects with spectral data of known mixtures. The data obtained from these mixtures was compared to two of the major groups of Kuiper Belt Objects, the gray BB group and the red RR group. It was hypothesized that the RR group contains more carbon and the BB group contains more clays such as montmorillonite, enstatite, nontronite, and serpentine. The results, however, demonstrate that charcoal, montmorillonite, and nontronite may be responsible for the high slope in red wavelengths of the RR group of Kuiper Belt Objects while coal could cause the flat slope across the spectrum of the BB group. <br><br>

INTERPLANETARY CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS
Kathryn Grace Wittman
Winston Churchill High School, San Antonio, TX, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) with strong, smooth magnetic field rotation have similar plasma and composition properties as ICMEs that have smooth magnetic field lines but have little to no magnetic field rotation and to identify them automatically. It was hypothesized that both types of ICMEs have similar plasma and composition properties and that they can be identified automatically.<br><br> To test this hypothesis magnetic field data (<|B|>, RTN Long., RTN Lat.) was downloaded in ten-day intervals. ICMEs that have smooth, strong magnetic field rotation and intervals that have smooth magnetic field angles but no strong rotation were examined. ICME criteria was defined as intervals where the standard deviations of RTN Long. and RTN Lat. quantities were less than five and where <|B|> quantity was greater than ten. Next, plasma (H+ density, H+ temperature, 4He/H+, H+ speed) and composition (C6/C5, O7/O6, Fe/O, Mg/O, <Q>Fe) quantities were examined. These parameters were used to calculate functions-- Tp/Tex, Beta, (Mg/O)ex, (O7/O6)ex, and (<Q>Fe)ex --which have been shown to have distinct values in ICMEs. For example, the Beta function, derived from the density, temperature and magnetic field strength, is often below 0.1 in ICMEs. In this project, an ICME was recognized by positive results in multiple of the above quantities and functions.<br><br> Statistical analysis, such as the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination, shows that the hypothesis was approximately correct. It was found that there is a moderate correlation between the B Mag quantity and the Beta function with the rotation of the magnetic field but it also shows that there is a weak correlation between the rotation of the magnetic field and the other quantities and functions. <br><br>

TYPE-I X-RAY BURSTS AND FAST FLARES EVIDENCE FOR BLACK HOLES' EVENT HORIZONS
Yazeed Mohammed O Alturki

The All-Sky Monitor on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer has been working for ten years. Data observed by ASM is stored in a main catalog that includes all sources and their emissions. Many sources and X-ray bursts remain unstudied due to lack of analysis. The study extracts type-I X-ray bursts from RXTE's main catalogue and identifies their sources. <br><br>Furthermore, the study provides an analysis method recommended to be used on Chandra X-ray Observatory and RXTE in order to seclude type-I X-ray bursts from the two observatories' observations for further studies. The study uses chi-square statistics and further methods to identify irregular X-ray observations then uses visual identification to select type-I X-ray bursts from the resulting pool of observations. <br><br>It has been hypothesized by Narayan et al (2002) that black holes exist with event horizons if proven as non-emitters for type-I X-ray bursts. Throughout the process, no BHCs and BHBs were identified as sources for type-I X-ray bursts, thus; we conclude that our confidence in the hypothesis stating the use of type-I X-ray bursts as evidence for event horizons has been highly strengthened.<br><br>

OPTICAL NONLINEARITY AND QUASI-PERIODIC EFFECT IN LASER-DAMAGE PREVENTION FOR SENSORS
Duanni Huang
La Cueva High School, Albuquerque NM, United States of America

In order to prevent laser damages to optical sensors, a smart optical limiter in front of sensors can be employed, blocking the incidence of an intense laser beam while leaving a weak light signal go through completely. In this optical-limiter research, the average transmission coefficients of a nonlinear disordered Fibonacci (quasi-periodic) chain for an incident light wave packet are calculated as functions of the photon flux of an incident light field with various types of chains of optical scatterers, numbers of embedded nonlinear scatterers, and energies of incident photons. If the incident optical field is very weak, the nonlinear optical scattering in the chain becomes negligible and the chain behaves like a transparent dielectic slab. It is also found that localization effect in a disordered quasi-periodic chain reduces transmission only when the incident optical field, i.e. the strength of optical scatterers, is strong. Furthermore, localization effect, which increases with the number of scatterers in the chain, is found to yield an enhanced optical nonlinearity of the system. The localization effect on the incident optical wave in the chain can be accelerated by an intense light illumination in the presence of a large number of nonlinear optical scatterers. When energetic photons fly through the chain, they tend to ignore most of the embedded optical scatterers. By using the results of this research project, a smart protection approach with automatic optical switching for sensitive optical sensors can be developed.

GREAT BALLS OF FIRE!
Caroline Julia von Wurden
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos NM, USA

In this experiment I attempted to make artificial ball lightning in a laboratory, using an electric discharge from points of metal near a water surface to create a plasma. After observing properties of the floating plasma with video, still cameras, photodiodes, and spectroscopy in my experiment, I compared them to reports of ball lightning in Nature, and observed similarities, although smaller sizes and shorter durations. <br><br> By charging a 0.4 mF capacitor up to 4000 Volts, then switching it into a water resistor, I created an arc and a plasma in the air. I used two geometries of center electrodes...pointed and flush. In the pointed case, an insulated central electrode poked a few mm out of the water surface, and a return ring electrode was located at the bottom of a bucket. However, it pushed up a ring of water with the plasma. A flush center electrode, just a mm underwater didn't disturb the water, and made more reproducible detached plasmas. I used NaCl, CuSO4, and LiCl, and the dominant color of the plasma was visually and spectroscopically the same as the characteristic colors of the metal of the salt. Filamentary structures suggest smoke particles may be present in the plasma object. The smoke may be carbon soot from the plastic insulator of the central electrode. When perturbed by an aerosol, the plasma ball took on colors from the aerosol components. Strong copper vapor lines at 510 and 578 nm suggest lasing action might be a possible application.<br><br>

DOES THE VOLUME OF A RESONANT CHAMBER AFFECT THE AMPLITUDE OF A SOUND WAVE?
Theodore James Nelson, Ryan Joseph Mokrzycki
Hinckley/Finlayson High School, Hinckley, Minnesota, United States

The hypothesis of this project was, "If the volume of the resonant chamber is increased, then the amplitude of the sound wave produced will be greater." The purpose of this project was to study how the use of a resonant chamber affects the amplitude of a sound wave. The methods used in this project are to affix the subwoofer to the 3.5 meter long sono tube, then calibrate the amplifier and microphone. Sweep and pink noise features of the Real Time Analyzer were used to test the subwoofer. 0.5 meters were cut off of the sono tube and the subwoofer was retested. This process was repeated seven times. The results showed that up to a certain length, the amplitude of the sound wave produced was increased. After this point was reached, the amplitude began to decrease. Because the hypothesis stated that a resonant chamber with a larger volume will result in an increased amplitude, the hypothesis was proven correct. However, it was also proven that after a certain volume, the amplitude would begin to decrease.<br><br>

HIGH EFFICENCY MULTY STAGE MAGNETIC ACCELERATOR (COILGUN)
Andrei G. Savenka, Maksim V. Paulavets
Secondary school #218, Minsk, BELARUS

PURPOSE: Design, creation and studying of possible use of high efficiency multistage electromagnetic accelerator (coilgun).<br><br>Multistage accelerator is created by gathering in consecutive order several single stage accelerators switching on one after another during the movement of the projectile along the barrel. That is why we decided to start with creation of a single-stage accelerator. After a number of experiments we have reached optimal performance and built a single-stage accelerator with 5% efficiency which exceeds wide-known rates. Then we came to creation of multistage accelerator. According to our calculations the efficiency of multistage coilgun must be higher than efficiency of single-stage coilgun. Efficiency increases while dissipation of energy due to heating of wires decreases with a decrease of the currents. The most important problem while building multistage coilgun is to find the right time to turn successive stages on. We've solved this problem using photo gates and developed scheme, which let us to increase the efficiency up to 20-30%, which is not a limit and to our estimation efficiency may be increased even further. The proposed scheme is not complicated, effective and rather simple. It has a great number of applications and is an important step on the way of effective use of electromagnetic energy in the sphere of transport, military sphere, space exploration and other spheres of human activity.<br><br>

The purpose of this project was to develop a speed radar device that uses the Doppler Principle to detect motion of cars behind a cyclist on a roadway. This device potentially could drastically reduce the number of injuries caused to cyclist while riding on busy roads.<br><br> The Doppler Principle is based on the fact that as the time-rate of distance between the observer and a source of fairly consistent motion decreases, the reflected waves are of greater wavelength.<br><br> In this project, a motion detector was created to be placed on the back of a bicycle. The construction that the device required was assembling the LED PC board and the microwave oscillator. With the two options of using a sound output or the LED screen, it was decided that LED screen was more effective, and would alert the rider with more effectiveness than the audio would.<br><br> Using the device, the experimenters were able to successfully detect a car approaching from behind a bicycle. This device could give a cyclist a sense of security as they go out on the roads for exercise and pleasure.

ANALYSIS OF VARIABLES ON PARACHUTE EFFECTIVENESS
David George Porter, Saifu Muhammad
Lafayette Senior High School, Lexington, KY, U.S.A.

Parachutes are designed to enable objects to descend from heights safely by creating drag, or air resistance. The purpose of this project was to determine which variables affecting parachute design have positive effects on their ability to provide drag. The hypothesis of this experiment was that changes in the design of the parachute would affect the rate of fall. <br><br>During the course of our study, we designed many different parachutes. We tested three different variables while holding all other parameters constant. Some of the variables we tested included the shape of the parachutes, the vent radii in the parachutes, the number of strings on the parachutes, and the surface area of the parachutes. We dropped the parachutes from a height of 11.35 meters in a controlled environment, and measured the time it took the parachute to descend from that height. <br><br>We analyzed our parachutes based on quantitative (rate of fall) and qualitative (stability of the parachutes) measurements. Based on the data we collected, we determined that a circular parachute with a vent in the center produced the most desirable results. This parachute was the most stable in flight, had the slowest rate of fall, and in turn the slowest terminal velocity. This parachute would be the most efficient use of a given amount of material for producing the most stable flight, and softest landing.<br><br>

HEATING THE RINGS THE THERMODYNAMICS OF THE RINGS OF SATURN
Micah Wylde, Christopher Souvey
Georgiana Bruce Kirby, Santa Cruz, CA, USA

The intent of our project was to determine the sources of energy in Saturn’s rings by analyzing their temperatures. We used spectra collected from the rings by Cassini’s CIRS (Composite Infrared Spectrometer) in October, 2005. We wrote software in C# that analyzed the spectral data from the lit and unlit sides of the rings in order to determine temperature. This was done by fitting them to an ideal blackbody curve. We then plotted the ring temperatures as a function of radius to analyze general trends. We graphed this with optical depth data and plotted it with our temperature graphs. With the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we calculated the energy that should be coming from Saturn and the Sun, and found that in the optically thick B and C rings those bodies did not explain all of the energy, leaving 7.2K in the B ring and 6.8K in the C ring. Graphing the difference between the actual lit temperature and the calculated temperatures as a function of optical depth showed a direct correlation. We then calculated theoretical temperatures for the unlit side using the optical depth and lit side temperatures to determine the amount of energy making it through the rings to the unlit side. Similarly to our lit side results, we found a direct correlation between this difference and optical depth. As the number of ring particles is directly correlated with optical depth, we concluded from these two correlations that the excess temperatures were caused by collisions amongst the ring particles.

USING THE DOPPLER EFFECT TO CALCULATE THE VELOCITY OF A HIGH POWERED ROCKET
Kyle James Yawn, Andrew Tyler Hull
Warner Robins High School, Warner Robins, GA, USA

In an attempt to find an efficient way to determine the maximum velocity of a rocket, wave generators will be flown in a high powered rocket and the tones generated will be recorded during flight. Due to the Doppler Effect, the frequencies of these tones will shift due to the velocity of the rocket traveling away from the observer of the waves. We hypothesized that if an amateur radio transmitter and a tone generator are placed in a high powered model rocket and the frequency of them are measured during flight, then the velocity of the rocket can be determined from the measured shift in frequency of the transmitter and tone generator. The manipulated variable is the change in speed of the rocket during flight and the responding variable is the frequency shift. After performing two flights while measuring the frequency of the tone generator on the side of the rocket during flight, a shift in the frequency of the tone was able to be detected; however this tone is not able to be heard during maximum velocity due to the noise made by the rocket motor. This method did prove to provide a sound way of measuring the velocity of a rocket; however it is not as precise as the experimenters hoped for it to be due to inaccuracies in the measurement system due to the motor noise. We hope to expand this project in the future and develop a method of achieving accurate results using the Doppler Effect.

STUDY OF VIBRATIONAL MODES IN DNA USING TERAHERTZ PHOTONIC CRYSTALS
Warren Cheng, Erin Zeqja, Ben Aronowicz
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, New York, United States

Resonant frequencies associated with the vibrational modes of DNA are predicted to lie in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Current techniques used to identify DNA structure utilize fluorescent, mutagenic labels that alter DNA's structure. It was hypothesized that a dielectric stack-based cavity resonator producing resonance in the terahertz could be constructed which would allow for real time repeated scanning of DNA structure with increased accuracy and no damage to the DNA. A dielectric resonator constructed from two 10 period stack mirrors of alternating fifty micron thick layers of Teflon and air, in between which a defect layer was present. It was composed of six low refractive index layers (air). Reflectivity spectra generated by the FTIR spectrometer confirmed the theoretical simulations of the terahertz resonator once the thickness parameter was changed from fifty microns to fifty-eight microns. Absorption measurements of synthetic DNA, poly(dA-dT). poly(dA-dT), confirmed terahertz absorption due to its vibrational modes. In the future, DNA can be incorporated into the defect layer to allow scanning of its structure. Additional research can also lead to further improvements of the cavity resonator, enabling it to detect both DNA pairs as well as more complex DNA samples.

AN ALGORITHM FOR REMOVING EVENT PILEUP AND ITS APPLICATION TO 200 GEV AU+AU COLLISIONS AT RHIC
Daniel L Stewart, Adam Lee Johnson
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington, New York, USA

The quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a highly interactive system of deconfined quarks and gluons, is a phase of matter described as a “perfect liquid”. The QGP is theorized to have been the state of the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang and can be reproduced in high energy collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Fluctuations in the ratio of the number of kaons to pions produced in collisions help to describe the mechanisms that govern QGP formation. In this research, discrepancies observed in measurements of K/ð fluctuations in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC are attributed to collision pileup due to elevated luminosity levels. A novel algorithm is presented that reconstructs collision vertices to identify and remove events with pileup. Utilization of this algorithm is shown to successfully eliminate discrepancies in the data. The resulting measurements help to verify theorized properties of QGP production mechanisms.

RELIABILITY OF CMOS CHIPS IN DETECTING ALPHA RADIATION
Sergio Lozano, Daniel Lozano, Jonathan Munoz
Weslaco High School, Weslaco Texas, United States

The purpose of our project is to determine the reliability of a common image detector (“CMOS”) with respect to alpha particle detection. These CMOS detectors are inexpensive and easily obtainable as the main element of ordinary webcams. So, if we could establish that these reliably detected particles we would have found a potentially valuable new laboratory tool. <br><br>Ideally, we would compare the absolute particle count to what we saw with the CMOS detector. Unfortunately, we were faced with the problem that we could not easily determine the absolute particle count. Therefore, we had to come up with a series of experiments that would produce trends that could possibly support our hypothesis.<br><br>The semiconductor imaging surfaces were removed from webcams and mounted onto Plexiglas plates. We constructed a vacuum chamber of PVC pipe. As a test source of alpha radiation we used Americium-241 from a household smoke-detector. Data was recorded as video files, and alpha hits were counted frame by frame to obtain the count rate.<br><br>Our initial test was to determine if a single CMOS detector would consistently count alpha particles. We found this to be the case. Next, we measured count rates with different models of detectors and found that the count rate was proportional to the area of the detector. Finally, using a single detector, we varied the source-detector distance and found the count rates abided by the expected Inverse Square Law. These results, together, suggest that the CMOS detectors are, in fact, registering all incident alpha particles. <br><br>

IMPROVING LASER EFFICIENCY USING RHODAMINE 6G IN A ND:YAG LASER
Ryan John Clark, Alexandra Morgan Smith, Chelsey Lynn Webb
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA

The purpose of this effort was to improve the efficiency of a Nd:YAG laser by adding a fluorescent dye to the coolant. <br><br> Research was conducted in the 1960s and 70s and a 50% increase in efficiency was recorded using dyes in the laser’s coolant. This experiment differed from the 60s demonstration because a diffuse-reflector, close-coupled pump chamber was utilized. Based upon previous results, Rhodamine-6G was selected as the dye. Rhodamine-6G absorbs between 510-545 nm and re-emits between 530-590 nm. This emission matches the 560-590 nm absorption band in Nd:YAG.<br><br> The 60s experiment reported an optimum concentration of 5E-6M. In this experiment, the concentration was varied from 4E-7M to 1E-3M; the optimum concentration was measured to be 5E-4M. It was hypothesized that the optimum concentration was greater with the diffuse reflector pump chamber because the coolant passages were smaller than in the 60s pump chamber. <br><br> The addition of Rhodamine-6G increased the laser efficiency from 2.6 to 3.0%, peaking at a 17% increase. While this improvement is approximately a third of the 60s results, the 17% increase, coupled with the fact that this laser was already double the overall efficiency of the 60s pump chamber, was a significant improvement. <br><br> It is concluded that a better optimized fluorescent dye or mixture of dyes could further improve efficiency. A two sample T-test was conducted to compare the efficiency of the control to the efficiency of the Rhodamine-6G /ethanol solutions. The fact that Rhodamine-6G significantly increased the efficiency of the Nd:YAG laser was statistically and experimentally supported.<br><br><br>

Vinayak Ramesh, Yomay Shyur
Oak Ridge High School, El Dorado Hills, CA, USA

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a new generation of “active” cantilevers with integrated piezoresistive sensors and thermal bi-morph actuators for High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging. The results of this study proved that this is indeed feasible. This new knowledge will revolutionize the AFM industry by enabling the manufacturing of much smaller, cheaper, and faster Atomic Force Microscopes. New and innovative ways of imaging samples, made possible by active cantilevers will eliminate the use of bulky lasers and position sensitive detectors in AFMs. In addition, there exists the potential to significantly increase the speed of imaging samples while achieving much higher image resolutions than before. This study also investigated the properties and operating characteristics of active cantilevers in both air and liquids, and to determine whether these cantilevers provide a significant improvement over previous cantilevers.

ON THE DIRECT DETECTION OF DARK MATTER WITH LENS, A NEW LOW ENERGY DIRECTIONALLY SENSITIVE WIMP DETECTOR
Alex Marshall, Eric Casavant
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA, United States

More than 90% of the matter in the universe is invisible and unknown, though it is theoretically composed of dark matter. The leading candidate for the majority of dark matter in the universe is known as the WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), yet it <br><br>has never been directly detected. This project proposes a novel method of directly detecting WIMPs. For this project, we assume a WIMP is also a Neutralino, which is predicted independently by MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model). This gives us a WIMP model with calculated characteristics, which we used to design and hypothetically compare our detector with others. The detector is named LENS (Low Energy Neutralino Search), and it will detect mercury ion recoils resulting from WIMP interactions. We accomplish this by using a thin solid state mercury target medium sheet placed inside a highly evacuated and cooled chamber. Above the target medium is a TPC (time projection chamber), and surrounding the target medium are PMTs (Photo Multiplier Tubes). In the event of a WIMP interaction, a single mercury atom will spontaneously ionize and leave the medium. Because it is ionized, its trajectory<br><br>is tracked through the TPC. Also, due to the WIMP interaction, the recoiling ion will also emit photons, which can be seen by the PMTs. Compared to other detectors, LENS brings several new advantages. It has the most efficiently used target mass, resulting in maximum interactions per kg/day. Superior methods of discrimination against non WIMP recoil events are accomplished with this detector, permitting a relatively shallow underground installation. LENS also offers the ability to read recoils with higher resolution, and it can measure the energy distribution of a WIMP interaction with greater accuracy.<br><br>

ON THE DIRECT DETECTION OF DARK MATTER WITH LENS, A NEW DIRECTIONALLY SENSITIVE LOW ENERGY WIMP DETECTOR
Eric Casavant, Alex Marshall
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino California, United States

Astronomical observations suggest that there is a huge amount of matter in the universe that is invisible and seemingly undetectable. This invisible matter is known as dark matter, and it has been theorized to exist for nearly a century. The WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle, also referred to as the Neutralino) is the leading candidate for the particle that constitutes the majority of dark matter density in the universe. However the WIMP has never been directly detected. This project proposes a new WIMP detector called LENS, the Low Energy Neutralino Search. It will detect WIMPs by observing recoil and photon emission caused by WIMP-mercury nucleon collisions. When compared with existing dark matter detectors, LENS has many contributions that it can bring to the search for dark matter. It has the most efficiently used target mass (the most amount of interactions per kg/day), and the lowest observable recoil energy threshold. Also, superior methods of discrimination against non WIMP recoil events have been found specifically for this detector. LENS also has the ability to view recoils with the highest resolution, and can view the energy distribution of a WIMP interaction with the highest accuracy.

ANALYSIS OF THE BILLIARD GAME USING PHYSICS LAWS
Mirelys Rivera-Colon, Carmary Marquez Matos, Ariana E. Santiago Santiago
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, Puerto Rico

Experimental observations and mathematical analysis of the movement of the billiard balls were done throughout this research. Four hypotheses to answer the same number of research questions were proposed. One of these hypotheses assumed that the general equations that rule the movement of the billiard balls immediately after a collision are those related to displacement, friction forces, velocity, momentum and energy. It was also established that the laws of conservation of momentum and energy could be applied to this game. A third hypothesis established that the most frequent direction of the billiard balls will be the bi-dimensional movement when they are hit. The last hypothesis indicated that the balls on the corners of the triangle move before the others when they are hit for the first time. <br><br>To observe the most frequent direction of the balls, the same ball was hit one hundred times. Measurements of displacement, time, mass, angles and applied force were made. Friction forces (static and kinetic) were measured using a dual range force sensor. This data was used to calculate velocity, momentum, friction coefficients and kinetic energy. The analysis of these calculations showed that the laws of momentum and energy conservation explain the movement of the balls. The effect of the friction force on the movement was minimum and did not reduce the velocity and momentum significantly. The most frequent direction of the balls is bi-dimensional and the first balls to move are those on the second and third corner of the triangle.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CDSE AND CDS NANOCRYSTALS OPTICAL PROPERTIES

Escuela Vocacional Dr. Pedro Perea Fajardo, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico

Semiconductor Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals are actually used as protein markers in cancer detection. Literature points at semiconductor Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) as a new possible protein marker. The problem of this project was: if the CdS nanocrystal optical properties related to its size is comparable to CdSe particles but with less toxic radiation, to be used as a protein marker. The hypothesis was that the Ultraviolet-Visible(UV-Vis) and Photoluminescence(PL) characterization will evidence that CdS particles have better optical properties than CdSe as a protein marker. The method used was two phases (organic and inorganic) using the metal complexing agent Trisodium Nitrilo-Triacetic acid (SNTA) at a concentration of 0.25M and changing the molar ratio parameter of Cd/Se and Cd/S within the range of 0.78 to 6.7. The results obtained in the characterization of UV-Vis showed that CdS had the absorption peak at a wavelength of 395 nm and at a low 0.78 molar ratio. The characterization for PL showed that CdS radiation of emission might be less toxic compared to that of CdSe.<br><br>Conclusions are that the CdS size particle presented the two optical properties that were looked for: a size comparable to that of CdSe nanocrystal and less toxicity as a protein marker. Obtained information can be useful to explore the synthesis of CdSe/ZnS core-shell Quantum Dots for potential applications as biological sensor for cancer detection.<br><br>

THE MOST EFFICIENT INSULATION
Benjamin Cooper Ray, Tate Hall
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, Kentucky, United States

After Tate and I (Cooper) conducted all the trials for our experiment and found the mean/average for our results we decided the following information: The Aluminum Bubble Wrap was the most inconsistent, we thought this because after ten minutes it contained the most heat (a mean of 158°F). After longer periods of time the heat wasn’t being contained well at all after temperatures in the box reached 200 °F plus. The Foam Board and The Spray Foam, though not being the best insulators, were the most consistent coming in the top three places insulating every time. The best overall insulation in our opinion is the Fiberglass. We think this because though it had low heat containment for the 10 minute trials, it came back and turned out to be the best in the 60 minute test with 291.5 °F. So overtime it held in the most heat, in longer periods of time, which would make it the most practical insulation. Also we were going to add in the commonly used insulation known as Cellulose, which is also known as Rock Wool, or Blow-In. The reason we decided not to use this insulation is because it was messy, and to keep it from spilling everywhere, we had to add in other variables. It got to the point where it would not have been valid compared to the other insulations. Some questions that we had to ask ourselves were:<br><br>Is the insulation inside the boxes proportional?<br><br>Were the temperature affected by the temperature of the room?<br><br>Was the thermometer accurate?<br><br>Did the hot glue affect the job of the insulation?<br><br>Those are some of our questions that we had to ask ourselves after the experiment had been conducted.<br><br>

In the presence of external magnetic field the magnets would attract each other with the force different from that one in the absence of external field. The change in pressure that magnets exert on the piezoelectric layer would result in electric signal due to the piezoelectric effect thus making effective magnetoelectric conversion with no power supply.<br><br>We developed the following design: the first magnet (“fixed”) is firmly attached to the substrate, the piezoelectirc layer is on the top of it and the second magnet (“mobile”) is attached to the top of the piezoelectric layer and not constrained from the top. All the structure is put in the protective shroud not to be broken down in high magnetic field (~1 Tesla).<br><br>Another important problem is the miniaturization of the device. The scaling rule, i.e. the relation of the output voltage and the size of the sensor, is investigated. The particular subject of the study is dependence of output on diameter and thickness of the layers.<br><br>Magnetic field influences on the magnets, their pressure on the piezoelectric changes, with pressure changes output voltage of the piezoelectric changes.

RELATIVISTIC EFFECT OF THE GLOBULAR STAR CLUSTERS SECOND HALO
Vladislav S. Ukhanev , Semen M. Reshetnyak
FENU, Vladivostok, Russian Federation

Some globular star clusters (GSC) are characterized by presence of so-called halo - unusual concentration of stars in external areas. It is considered, that this singularity appears due to the stars which are situated behind GSC, as a result of effect of gravitational focusing - deviations of light beams under action of gravitational fields of massive matters. The Purpose of the present study is research of stars concentration changes in GSC from the center to edge, and also an explanation of the probable reasons of GSC halo occurrence. GSC of the spectral class F have been studied. GSC have been chosen occasionally, and all of them have had insignificant visible compression. For each GSC corresponding diagram of dependence of concentration of stars vs. distance from a core have been plotted. Measurements were fulfilled taking into account an average external star background and possible errors arising during such measurements. On the diagrams plotted during research there were found out deviations in an external zone of GSC core and in a middle zone of a crown, practically on border with external crown GSC. Differences between the diagrams investigated are in some irregular shift of splashes relatively to spatial zones in a cluster (in the different sides). <br><br>As a result of research it had been confirmed a presence of two halos which are not connected with rotation of clusters. The origin of halo has no dynamic, but the relativistic nature. It was found out, that GSC of the same spectral class F have similar structure of halo. It was concluded, that formation of halos happened due to gravitational lensing of the field of stars behind GSC. The most probable space object possessing weight (105-107 M☼) necessary for gravitational lensing, may be « a black hole », located in an internal zone of GSC core.<br><br>

HOW DOES HUMIDITY AFFECT THE EXPLOSIVE ENERGY OF FIREWORKS?
Jay Kanwar Singh Gill, Jason Morriss, George Stevens
Paul M. Dorman High School, Roebuck, S. C. , U. S. A.

The effect of humidity in the storage environment of fireworks on the relative explosive energy of those fireworks was determined. A device for measuring the explosive energy was constructed using a clear plastic tube and some PVC fittings. To create varying amounts of humidity in which fireworks were stored, one to 27 drops of water in increments of 2 drops were placed in plastic sandwich bags. In order to prepare enough fireworks for repeated tests at each humidity level, and to have an excess of fireworks stored in the event that some fireworks misfired or were abnormally more or less powerful, 5 fireworks were stored in each increment of humidity. The fireworks were exploded in a PVC fitting on the bottom of the clear tube, and a ping pong ball was propelled upward. The clear plastic tube was marked every 3 inches, and a video camera was used to record the maximum height the ball achieved. This project demonstrated the negative effects of humidity on the explosive energy of the fireworks. When graphed, the data that was collected showed a clear slope, where the added amounts of humidity had an adverse effect on the explosive energy of the fireworks. It was found that as the humidity in the storage environment of fireworks was increased, the fireworks’ explosions produced less energy or work. Additionally it was found that as the humidity in the storage environment was increased, that the consistency of the fireworks’ explosive energy decreased.

In the experiment, the effects of humidity on the force of fireworks were tested. The purpose of this experiment was to find out how the humidity of the air in a firework’s storage area affects the force of the firework’s explosion. A special device using a clear plastic tube and some PVC fittings was developed to measure the force emitted by the fireworks. To demonstrate the effects of humidity, 1 drop to 27 drops of water were added to the storage area in increments of 2 drops. 5 fireworks were stored in each increment of humidity, in the event that one firework of each increment misfired or was more/less powerful. The fireworks were exploded in the bottom of the clear tube, and a ping pong ball was propelled upward. The clear plastic tube was marked every 3 inches, and a video camera was used to record the maximum height the ball achieved. The varying heights that were created show the effects of humidity on the force of fireworks. By exploding 75 fireworks, this project demonstrated the negative effects of humidity on the force of the fireworks. The data that was collected resulted in a downward curve, where the added amounts of humidity had an adverse effect on the force of the fireworks when exploded. As the humidity was increased, the fireworks’ explosions produced less force and became more inconsistent. The first increments up to 7 drops produced heights that were higher and more consistent then the following increments.

A QUANTUM COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE ATOMIC MANY-BODY PROBLEM

Many applications of quantum mechanics in chemistry or condensed-matter physics involve determining the time evolution of a complex system of mutually interacting quantum mechanical particles, otherwise known as the many-body problem. With their inherent ability to utilize quantum mechanical effects for performing physical simulations, quantum computers could potentially solve the many-body problem on a much larger scale and much more efficiently than classical computers. However, most research that has already been done regarding the applications of quantum computers to the many-body problem has produced few explicit simulations for real physical scenarios.<br><br> This project presents a general quantum computational model for simulating the behavior of an arbitrary number of electrons around a central nucleus acting under the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation, focusing on the molecular Hamiltonian associated with a single atom. Specific examples of quantum circuits simulating the structure of different atoms are also developed and used to perform numerical simulations. This research bears ready applications in condensed-matter physics. Hopefully, these methods can be extended to large systems of atoms and molecules to accurately predict the properties of various substances and materials.

FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF AN IONIC POLYMER METAL COMPOSITE TREATED WITH VARIOUS COUNTER IONS
Malone Russell Locke
Trinity Catholic High School, Ocala, FL

Ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) is a class of electroactive polymer (EAP) that bends in response to a small electric field applied across its thickness as a result of mobility of cations in the polymer network. IPMCs are touted as the basis for future artificial muscles due to their unique properties. To better understand and explore the muscle-like actuation behavior of this novel EAP, a typical IPMC was fabricated and characterized in various cation forms. <br><br>The fabricated IPMC consisted of the base polymer membrane, Nafion® 117, metal-plated with platinum electrodes and exchanged for various cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+). An experimental setup employing a variable DC power supply with dual electrode clamp was developed to study the actuation behavior of the newly fabricated IPMC strips in a cantilever configuration submerged in deionized water. An applied potential of 2.5V was used to evaluate normalized tip displacement for each cation form. Similarly, extent of tip deflection from its initial vertical position for a given voltage was measured.<br><br>Nafion®-based IPMCs in Li+, Na+, and K+ cation forms have a similar actuation behavior, with the magnitude and speed of their displacement varying for each cation form. For Li+ form, the initial fast displacement is recovered only partially in relaxation motion under a sustained DC voltage, whereas for Na+ and K+, the relaxation motion takes the sample beyond its initial position and towards the cathode. <br><br>Overall, the magnitude of deflection for a given voltage was greater for Li+-based IPMCs compared to Na+- and K+-based IPMCs.

MASS MEASUREMENT WITH MICROMECHANICAL OSCILLATORS
Saahil Dev Sanon
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

MEMS stands for microelectromechanical system. “Micro” indicates that the parts of the device are all on the micrometer scale or on scales even smaller. “Electro” refers to electric pulses and signals that can be sent through the device. “Mechanical” indicates that there are moving parts on the device. The purpose of this experiment is to measure the mass of gold deposited on a device and figure out its location in relation to the center of the device. The goal of the experiment is to see a change in both the torsional and translational frequencies when the mass is deposited. The hypothesis of this experiment is that the translational frequency will shift by 305 Hz and the torsional frequency will shift by 84 Hz. Therefore, the mass added is hypothesized to be 6.6 nanograms.<br><br> The procedures in this experiment consist of measuring the profile of the device, evaporating gold onto the device, and then measuring the change in profile. At the end of the project, the change in translational frequency was 225 Hz and the change in the torsional frequency was 37 Hz. The final mass of gold added to the device was 5.56 nanograms and the areas where the gold was deposited were 112 um and 13 um from the center of the device.

DO STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS PROTECT PIGMENTS FROM THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF UV-B LIGHT?
Ashan Singh Banwatt
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

This experiment was on whether or not the effects of ultraviolet-B radiation of potassium ferricyanide covered paper exposed to a magnetic field would be minimized. This was tested by cutting 6, 2*4 inch pieces of potassium ferricyanide covered paper and exposing three of them to UV-B radiation and a magnetic field (created by 2, 3* ½ * ¾ neodymium magnets each with 13500 gauss of pull strength) and exposing the other three just to the UV-B radiation. Each of the tests were performed for 20 minutes in a room shielded from all external light but slightly illuminated by a 25 watt red light bulb, which would not react with the potassium ferricyanide covered paper, that was kept 10 feet away. The experiment was performed in 3 sets in which each set had one piece of paper exposed to the UV-B radiation and one exposed to UV-B radiation and the magnetic field. After the pieces of paper were exposed to the UV-B radiation or the UV-B radiation and magnetic field combination they were put in distilled water so the un-reacted potassium ferricyanide would be rinsed off. After the pieces of paper were air dried each was labeled with its set number and type. They were then evaluated by 4 un-biased observers in a blind test in which the darker sheets were determined to be the ones exposed to the magnetic field and UV-B radiation. The conclusion was that the magnetic field enhanced the photochemical reaction of the UV-B radiation and the potassium ferricyanide covered paper.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLYGON-SHAPED VORTICES AND THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF A FLUID: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Aaron Mitchell Stecker
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to answer the question, “How do the trends of polygonal vortices change as the specific gravity of the fluid is altered?” The hypothesis is, “If a fluid with a higher specific gravity and a fluid with a lower specific gravity are spun until they resemble the same shape, then the fluid with the higher specific gravity will resemble the shape at a lower RPM than the fluid with the lower specific gravity.” There were 11 speeds and four specific gravities tried (50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 800 RPM and 0.79, 0.89, 1.00, and 1.12, respectively). A rigid disc was suspended from a threaded rod and spun in a container of isopropanol, corn oil, water, or ethylene glycol. Water was the control, with a specific gravity of 1.00, and five trials of each fluid at each speed were conducted. Data was collected during every trial, noting the shape of the vortex. The modal results of the vortexual shapes are as follows (speed is in RPM). For isopropanol: 50, 100, 150, 300, and 400 yielded no shape; 200 yielded a quadripole; 350, 450, and 500 yielded dipoles; 800 yielded a hexagon. For corn oil: 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, and 450 yielded no shape; 300 yielded a triangle; 350 yielded a quadrilateral; 500 and 550 yielded dipoles; 800 yielded a trapezoidal quadrilateral. For water: 50, 100, 150, and 400 yielded no shape; 200, 350, and 500 yielded dipoles; 300 yielded a non-distinct polygon; 450 yielded a triangle; 550 yielded a tripole; 800 yielded a hexagon. For ethylene glycol: 50 and 100 yielded no shape; 150 yielded a non-distinct polygon; 200, 300, 350, 400, and 450 yielded dipoles; 500 yielded a triangle; 550 yielded a hexagon; 800 yielded a square. The hypothesis was supported by the data: fluids with higher specific gravities did exhibit similar shapes as fluids with lower specific gravities at lower speeds than the fluids with lower specific gravities.

PURE BRASS
Julie Dagenhardt
Terrebonne High School, Houma, LA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine which of the four basic brass instruments had the purest tone. My initial thought was that the trombone would have the purest tone. To test my hypothesis, I recorded each of the four instruments playing their tuning note, Bb concert. I then used a computer program to capture the sound waves from each of the recordings. I compared the consistency of both the amplitude and frequency of the waves. Using this information, I was able to determine that the tuba’s sound waves were the most consistent. This proved that the tuba had the purest tone.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN IMAGING PRISM SPECTROMETER
Dominik Schubert
Maria-Theresia-Gymnasium Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, GERMANY

Spectral analysis has long ago become an indispensible tool for a large number of scientists all over the world, regardless of their field of research. Imaging spectrometry takes existing techniques even further by adding a spatial dimension, yielding digital images with spectral information for every single pixel. This enables researchers to acquire huge amounts of spectral data in the field with a minimal effort. Applications are nearly unlimited (though not fully investigated yet) and include monitoring of vegetation health, geological classification and detection of water pollution.<br><br>The major factor preventing the exploitation of this potential is the price and availability of suitable devices. The goal of the project was to develop an imaging spectrometer, built from parts I could easily obtain and that cost less than 1,000 Euros, while still being usable for a serious evaluation of this fascinating technology. After having characterized the optical components available to me, the next step, and the most critical part of all, was the design of the optical assembly, where high quality is of paramount importance for getting any results at all, and a solid mechanical construction, including the necessary scanning mechanism. Afterwards, I calculated an accurate spectral calibration curve by combining the design parameters with spectra recorded from a Balmer lamp. The device is controlled with self-written software that also offers various options for visualizing the captured images.<br><br>The image quality that was finally achieved exceeded all expectations and was better than with a device costing more than 10 times as much.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON AN ELECTRIC GENERATOR
Marisa Linnea Peralta
West Linn HIgh School, West Linn, OR

The purpose of this experiment is to explore the practicality of increasing a generator's efficiency by lowering its temperature. The hypothesis is that low temperatures that are still attainable by climate would increase a generator's power efficiency. Lower temperatures than this may increase efficiency more significantly, but energy would be required to attain such temperatures, and there would be no net gain. If the lowered temperatures can be attained for "free", such as by a cold climate, no extra input is needed for an increase in power.<br><br> <br><br> An electric generator was built and tested for this purpose. It was run at a constant rate at varying temperatures. The voltage, current, and resistance were measured at each temperature. The power, calculated from current and resistance, was plotted with magnet temperature and coil temperature. Though in theory the power should increase at lower temperatures, the results did not have a statistically significant relationship. Significant relationships were found, however, for the plots of temperature vs. resistance and for temperature vs. magnetic force. These relationships were expected, based on prior knowledge. However, the subsequent efficiency increase did not prove predictable.<br><br> Based on the theoretical and practical relationships between resistance, magnetic field strength, and temperature, it could be possible to design a small-scale generator that would harness a cold climate to increase efficiency. However, the results from this study do not show an immediately apparent connection between power output and temperature. The concept merits further investigation, in light of the importance of energy in today's world.

I CAN SEE THE LIGHT! IMPROVED DETECTION OF LATENT BLOOD STAINS WITH LUMINOL USING FLUORESCENT LASER DYES
Summit Subhash Pandat
Arkansas School for Mathematics & Sciences, Hot Springs, AR

One common method used by forensic scientists for detecting latent blood stains involves using the low wavelength chemiluminescent emission of luminol in the presence of hemoglobin. However, in order to see the chemiluminsecence of luminol, complete darkness is necessary since the blue emission is only visible without any other light interference. In this experiment, fluorescence was explored as a technique for absorbing the low wavelength emission of luminol and shifting it to one of a higher wavelength much more visible in lighted conditions. Rhodamine 6G, pyridine-1, and fluorescein were all observed in solution with luminol and bovine hemoglobin. Emission spectra were recorded for the fluorophores with luminol and compared with that of luminol alone. As a result, rhodamine 6G gave the largest shift in wavelength of 113.3 nm without any significant differences in intensity, whereas fluorescein had a less dramatic shift in wavelength of 63.9 nm, but gave a very significant shift in intensity. Pyridine-1 had complete absorption of the chemiluminescence but no observable emission. Thus the results of the experiment supported the hypothesis that a fluorophore could be mixed into solution with luminol and shift its emission spectrum to one more visible under lighted conditions. In order to perfect the technique, however more studies would need to be conducted on the concentration of the dyes in solution. This technique could one day serve as a tool for forensic scientists in detecting blood stains in the presence of almost any light.

CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR OF A DOUBLE PENDULUM
Pablo A Valdivia
Grants High School, Grants, NM

The purpose of this project is to show the chaotic behavior of a double pendulum. Chaos theory states that nonlinear dynamical systems may be sensitive to initial conditions. The hypothesis is that the double pendulum will follow the same path and vary only slightly towards the end of the drop. The path of the double pendulum was measured by the number of revolutions the lower arm made, the time the pendulum had motion, and by visual observant of the lower arm’s path. The results of the double pendulum showed that the complex system was random and no pattern could be drawn from the data. The rotations for each test were random. There was a minimum of two rotations and a maximum of 18 rotations. The time that the pendulum would swing ranged from 69 seconds to 172 seconds. Only at the end of the test could a pattern could be seen. It was either a single pendulum ending, in which the two arms almost became linear, or a double pendulum ending, the upper arm almost motionless while the lower rocked back and forth. There was 7 double pendulum ends with 8 single pendulum ends. The control, a single pendulum, swung for 202 seconds. The hypothesis was proven to be incorrect. The double pendulum was more complex then originally thought and each drop was unique. The time, in seconds, of each drop was unpredictable. The double pendulum became chaotic very fast due to small differences from drop to drop.

SOLITON PROPAGATION IN DIFFUSIVELY COUPLED CHAOTIC DOUBLE PENDULA
James Ernest Hanson
Century High School, Rochester, MN

Chaotic systems are deterministic and sensitive to initial conditions. Solitons are waves that propagate at a constant speed and maintain their shape. This study considers the propagation of solitons in a chaotic medium, namely diffusively coupled double pendula. This study’s hypothesis is that low energy waves will be able to propagate like classical solitons or approximately like classical solitons, but high energy waves will either dissipate or propagate in a chaotic way. The Runge-Kutta Fourth Order method was used to numerically solve the differential equations governing diffusively coupled single and double pendula. Systems of 100 single or 100 double pendula were simulated at various initial angles of the first pendulum and coupling strengths. The results were examined by looking at the index of the most energetic pendulum as a function of time. This data was compared to a triangle wave model, and the coefficient of correlation, or R², was calculated to determine the coherence of the soliton. The hypothesis was supported, but only within the domain of this simulation: the single pendula system was able to support solitons of any energy, but the double pendula system was unable to support high energy solitons and became unstable instead. Unfortunately, the total energy of the high energy solutions increased many fold, perhaps due to insufficiencies in the numerical integration technique, or the extrapolation of the single pendula coupling force to the double pendula system. No conclusion about an actual physical system of double pendula coupled by springs could be made.

ONE DIMENSIONAL POLYMERIC PHOTONIC CRYSTAL LASERS: FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION
Dora Christine Huang
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Known for their light propagation properties, photonic crystals contain bandgaps, forbidden regions for photons. These bandgaps are viewed on a transmission spectrum as a dip over a range of wavelengths, representing its region of high reflectivity to incident light. The purpose of this research was to fabricate one-dimensional, multilayered, polymer photonic crystals to create a microcavity laser to examine lasing modes, light penetration depth, and cavity size to broaden the understanding of polymer laser behavior. The co-extrusion technique created multilayered films, to surround a core layer doped with rhodamine 6G laser dye, to be used in the formation of plastic lasers. The lasing modes within these structures were measured to find the penetration depth of light and cavity size. A linear relationship between mode spacing and core layer sizes was found (y= 2.37(x +14.3)) and related to Tcavity = 2(Lp) + Tcore layer, where T = thickness and Lp =light penetration depth, to obtain a 7.2 um penetration depth measurement. Modeling revealed that this penetration depth could be accurately predicted when the variation in the layer thicknesses within the multilayer films was taken into account. It is anticipated that these small, plastic lasers can be used in applications for tunable lasers such as spectroscopy and remote sensing.

LOW-COST TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY
Harikrishna Rallapalli
Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton, CA

The goal of this project was to engineer a low-cost Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy package capable of single molecule detection. The microscope detects the blinking of single quantum dots as well as the fluorescence of single fluorophores. In addition, the Brownian motion of dye-doped polystyrene beads suspended in water has been observed, demonstrating a wide range of applications for this microscopy package for under $3000. <br><br>I developed this low-cost TIRF microscopy package by analyzing the fundamental concepts and re-engineering/substituting major cost components of the two TIRF methods i.e. Prism/Waveguide and High-Numerical Aperture Objective. Fundamental concepts behind TIRF microscopy, including total internal reflection, fluorescence, and microscopy, were analyzed to determine the following minimal components: inexpensive excitation source 532 nm green laser pointer, bioanylate (580/605) FluoSpheres® nanoparticles, and a microscope comprising plan 100x 1.25NA objective, 10x eyepiece, optical waveguide fiber bundle/trapezoidal YV04 prism, Barrier filter HQ555/50m-2p, 100% Al mirror.<br><br>This package enables research and experimentation requiring single-molecule resolution and supports a wide range of optional packages including CCD cameras and spectrometers. Assembling these packages enables hands-on learning of important science concepts ranging from TIR and Brownian Motion to fluorescence and nanometer resolution microscopy. The learning experience of actually building and experimenting with these versatile tools is unrivaled in comparison to using commercial products costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. With these low-cost accurate tools, even high school students can experiment with and question these principles.

WHAT'S TODAY'S FORECAST? HIGH ENERGY PROTONS: AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND THE PREDICTABILITY OF HIGH ENERGY PROTONS EMITTED BY X-RAY SOLAR FLARES, AND TO PREDICT THE RESULTING PROTON DENSITY
Sophia Marie Mitchell
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Solar flares are exploding prominences on the sun which emit high densities of dangerous protons into the solar wind. Having a precise method of advising pilots, astronauts, and scientists when a flux of high energy protons is approaching Earth would be beneficial to both the aviation and scientific worlds. It would keep astronauts healthy while in orbit, aid pilots (both commercial and military) who have to fly high in the atmosphere safe from radiation, and save money on satellite maintenance. This experiment was conducted to investigate the predictability of proton densities emitted from different solar flare sizes (B, C, and M with B being the smallest and M being the largest), and to create a proton density prediction model. It was hypothesized that the proton density in space is very predictable, and because of this a proton flux prediction model could be created. This project utilized data from two satellites via the internet: the Virtual Solar Observatory database, where information about individual solar flares is recorded and archived, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, where the proton density in space is recorded and archived. <br><br>After statistically analyzing the data and graphs created, it could be concluded that the data supported the hypothesis that proton density could easily be predicted, and a proton density model could be created. Therefore, it was possible to successfully predict proton densities for solar flares of sizes B, C, and M very accurately.

DETECTION OF BIOMOLECULES VIA COUPLING OF TYPE-I AND TYPE-II QUANTUM DOTS
Erin Zeqja
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

This project proposes a novel and unique method for environmental sensors based on the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Recently, efficient chemical and biological sensors have become extremely important because of their applications in homeland security and environmental control. These proposed sensors will establish improved diagnostic methods and sampling strategies in order to identify pathogens more rapidly and precisely. This is crucial in the protection of our public and soldiers from a chemical/ biological attack, viruses, or hazardous leakage. Two different types of QDs (type-II and type-I) were prepared having antibodies to specific pathogen agents. Photoluminescence measurements, transmission electron microscope, lifetime measurements and theoretical/ ideal energy transfer between both QDs were analyzed using Origin 7.2 and OceanOpticsBase32 programs. After collection of PL measurements from CdS (Cadmium Sulfide) and core-shell ZnO/CdS (zinc oxide- cadmium sulfide), the PL data was analyzed and peak shifts were noted through varying neutral density filters. The hypothesis was not supported since the experiment did not approach the stage where a colloidal mixture was prepared, consisting of type-I and type-II semiconductor nanoparticles and antibodies. Experimental data shows that due to very different lifetimes and peak positions in correlation with simulated energy transitions, it is possible for type-I and type-II QDs to detect specific pathogen agents when fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) will be possible between them. Devices based on this principle can achieve detection on a single-molecule level making possible particularly early diagnostics of warfare agents and will be inexpensive, compact and consume less power.

THE COLOR OF SOUND
Bradley Joseph Natarian
Old Mill Senior High School, Millersville, MD

Light beam communication (LBC), a wireless way to move sound, using light, will revolutionize communication if able to move through real-world media. I wanted to discover the effects of air, glass, clear plastic, frosted plastic, a plastic container, water, smoke, steam, incandescent light between the transmitter and receiver, incandescent light on the LED in the transmitter, incandescent light on the phototransistor in the receiver, LED light between the transmitter and receiver, LED light on the LED in the transmitter, and LED light on the phototransistor in the receiver on LBC. I hypothesized air would be the best medium for LBC because nothing would reflect, refract, or block the light transmitting the signal. I used an LBC kit and placed various media between the transmitter and receiver. To test the distance sound waves could be transmitted, I moved the receiver away from the transmitter until no sound could be detected by an oscilloscope. To test the clarity of the sound waves, I saved a screenshot of each transmission at a constant distance, comparing the harmonics of each wave. I found that incandescent light on the phototransistor, water, steam, and a plastic container most hindered LBC. My results also show that most types of light do not affect LBC unless directed toward the phototransistor. In conclusion incandescent light directed toward the phototransistor, water, steam, and a plastic container most hinder light beam communication.

This photometry suggested the absence of the flickering. <br><br>We determined the surface temperature of the red giant of the system to 4000 K. My project is important for stellar astronomy, that there are new parameters for symbiotic binaries. I calculate new orbital period, surface temperature.

FROSTY: THE STRONGEST MAGNET
Jessica Diaz de Tuesta
Earl Warren High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate whether temperature affects a magnet’s attraction. If the temperature of a magnet does affect its strength, then the lower the magnet's temperature the greater its power will be. Three different magnets (Neodymium, Samarium Cobalt, and Ceramic) were tested under four different temperatures using dry ice (-77°C), water ice (0°C), room temperature (23°C), and boiling water (100°C). After the magnets were exposed for twenty minutes under each temperature, they were removed and placed in their respective bowl—filled with 6,000 copper coated BBs. The amount of BBs attracted was counted after every trial. Each magnet was tested ten times. The data was then recorded and analyzed. The results from the experiment showed that temperature does affect a magnet’s strength and that when the magnets were exposed to lower temperatures their strength increased, as opposed to when they were exposed to higher temperatures their strength decreased. This is because all permanent magnets have a high temperature at which their magnetism is extinguished—called Curie temperature (measured in Kelvin [K]). The Curie temperature varies for each ferromagnetic material. The Curie temperature for the Neodymium (NdFeB) magnet is 573 K, 1098 K for the Samarium Cobalt (Sm2Co17) magnet, and 723 K for the Ceramic (SrCO3FeO) magnet. In conclusion, the lower the temperature of the magnet, the stronger the magnet will be, and the higher the temperature of the magnet the weaker it becomes until it reaches its Curie temperature, where its magnetism is extinguished.

THE AGE DETERMINATION OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AS A FUNCTION OF THE HEAT DISTRIBUTION OF COOL DEGENERATE WHITE DWARFS
Julian Micheal Rivera
St. Francis Preparatory High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

White dwarfs are the final stage of stellar evolution for intermediate-massed main sequence stars. Once a white dwarf is formed, it immediately begins cooling as a result of it lacking the ability to perform the nuclear processes to produce heat due to insufficient mass. It has been proposed that the age of white dwarfs could effectively be used to obtain the age of the galaxy itself. Since the evolution of a white dwarf is dominated by its cooling the main focus of this study is the temperature of the white dwarf. A point of contention on this topic was the negligence of the effect of the age of the progenitor stars on the temperature of the white dwarfs. This is precisely the factor this study took into in-depth consideration. The temperatures of white dwarfs in two postulated theories containing different star formation rate as a result of the different ages of progenitor stars were calculated to see not only if white dwarfs could distinguish the two star formation rate but also to see how accurately they could distinguish the different rates. It was discovered that white dwarfs possess the ability to differentiate among various star formation rate theories rather accurately in general settings.

I studied free-floating ball plasmas in the laboratory, created by an electric discharge from points of metal near a water surface, using cameras, photodiodes, power meters, and spectroscopy. The lifetime, brightness, and size of the plasma were varied with different geometries of electrodes and buckets, as a function of voltage. Air is excluded from the plasma (no nitrogen or oxygen lines are seen in the ball spectroscopically). The plasma's boundary layer changed when launched into Helium instead of air. With laser mirrors to form a cavity around the ball plasma, I looked for copper laser action at the 510.6 nm Cu I line, but did not see evidence for lasing action. <br><br><br>Long lived free-floating plasmas are generated above a bucket of water containing a weak solution of Copper Chloride, using copper electrodes. The plasma consists of positive salts from the solution and center electrode material, and negative hydroxyl radicals. I thought that a bigger plasma could be made in a bucket with more surface area, but this was not true. A better scaling knob is the applied voltage. I made plasmas with discharge currents ranging from 4 Amps to 250 Amps, as I increased the applied voltage up to 5kV. The plasmas became brighter, and somewhat larger. Dusty orange colored filamentary structures can be seen inside the glowing green plasma. When the bucket is surrounded by a bag of helium to exclude air, the orange boundary layer (seen in the air case) disappears.

The properties of a lens which is based on a left-handed material (LHM) have been studied previously in the microwave frequency range of 1- 18 GHz. The study of LHMs, lenses with a negative index of refraction (n), is important because of their potential use in situations in which naturally occurring materials cannot provide the same functionality. In this paper, a broadband, free-space system was used to measure the characteristics of the propagation of microwaves through a constructed LHM sample. This research seeks to develop a unique unit cell design for use in a lattice structure to show a negative index of refraction. Using receiving and source dipoles, measurements of the electromagnetic field strength map were measured with a vector network analyzer. In experiments in frequencies from 8.0 to 13.0 GHz, it was found that the constructed design of a unit cell, composed of two isolated perpendicular cross wire resonators (CWRs), provided a negative refractive index at the frequency 12.50 GHz. The production of a lens with left-handed properties was achieved with a gain coefficient of ~8.5 dB. This characterized CWR design is advantageous because of a higher gain coefficient and simpler fabrication. Some of the many applications that involve LHMs include antenna miniaturization, the creation of a lens that does not adhere to the diffraction limit, and the production of a cloaking mechanism at microwave or optical frequencies; these uses entail great potential in military and civilian life.

MATHEMATICAL PREDICTION OF FREQUENCY RESPONSE USING WAVE TRAECTORIES
Theodore James Nelson
Hinckley/Finlayson High School, Hinckley, MN

In this project the experimental acoustical response of a tube resonator was successfully modeled by predicting sound particle, or phonon, paths. The resonances of each phonon path were added then squared to obtain the total frequency response. The complex and curious features of the experimental data could be fully explained by the model. The experimentation was done using a 4ft tube with a small speaker on one end and a calibrated testing microphone on the other end. A computer was interfaced with both the speaker and microphone to coordinate the emission and recording of sound. The results demonstrate the model's capabilities as far as frequency response prediction and, in addition, suggest the existence of phase shifts upon reflection and an attenuation of signal associated with longer paths.

DOES WAVELENGTH AFFECT THE DIFFRACTION PATTERN OF LASER RADIATION?
Michael Vincent Di Mascio
Waynesville High School, Waynesville, OH

This experiment investigated the effects of wavelength on the diffraction pattern of laser radiation using three lasers – a 632.8nm He-Ne laser, a 617nm red diode laser, and a 532nm green diode laser – for improved capabilities. It was hypothesized that shorter wavelengths of laser radiation result less intensity with less intensity distribution. Each laser was aligned perpendicular and placed 2.1 meters from a vertical plane. The hair was aligned horizontally on a slide frame and placed 10 centimeters from the laser. A control was established; the red diode laser was directed at the hair and the 1m potentiometer with LED readout and photoresistor was adjusted to read the highest value 10 for the intensity of the first-order maximum above the primary maximum. Then, the resulting intensity was measured for each lasers’ five maximum orders of diffraction using the light meter. The distance between corresponding minima was measured above and below the central maximum. The mean after three trials of the five maximum orders' intensities and distances between corresponding minima are: green laser – 3.8 / 6.75cm, red laser – 4.4 / 8.06cm, He-Ne laser – 5.6 / 8.3cm. The green diode laser had the shortest wavelength with lowest intensity and least distance between minima. The hypothesis was correct. These results can be applied to developing specific frequencies of laser radiation for spectroscopy and interferometry with non-destructive materials interaction and laser missile defense without obstructive atmospheric interference; also, applied to developing high frequency lasers for precise vaporization in welding holes and for surgery.

THE REFLECTIVITY OF MATERIALS AT MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES
Hunter Wayne Long
Staunton River High School, Moneta, VA

When an electromagnetic wave traveling through free space strikes the boundary of a medium, a portion of the incident energy is reflected, while the remainder enters the medium. A test device was constructed to quantitatively measure the magnitude of the reflected wave from several different mediums and to determine the factors affecting the strength of this reflected wave. The reflectivities of fifteen different materials were determined. A microwave transmitter produced a wave incident on each of the fifteen materials. A microwave power meter then measured the magnitude of the wave reflected from the medium. Data analysis of the samples revealed that the metals aluminum and copper reflected much more energy than the non-metals tested. This was found to be due to the relatively high conductivity of these metals. Of the non metals, Lexan, which is transparent to visible light, was the most reflective. This research allows for more accurate modeling of electromagnetic waves incident upon the boundary of two media.

This project is Variable Color Thermometer. The relationship between light color and temperature enables this thermometer to show and predict variations in temperature. It can be used both as a light source and temperature detector.<br><br>This idea was taken from liquid crystal. The project was planned to make a thermometer which could be used comfortably by both educated and illiterate people. Those who cannot decipher digital thermometer can easily use this thermometer with the help of color guide.<br><br>The temperature is sensed by the temperature sensor in analogue form. A transducer converts the analogue signals into electrical signals. These electric signals are transmitted to the microprocessor. The microprocessor uses the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) method to adjust the duty cycle of each color and there by the color intensity of each color is decided. Thus the color formed by the combination of these intensities is displayed.<br><br>This thermometer has been used in a fish aquarium to detect the temperature of water, in a car as a temperature sensor and decoration, in an egg incubator and to detect the climatic temperature by using it on tower.<br><br>It can also be used in medical field e.g. in case there is fracture, blood blockage or tumor then if we move it on your body we can detect the infection by the change in color because temperature of infected part is different then other parts. All these modifications can be made by using more sensitive sensors or by increasing number of LEDs.

THE CREATION OF A SIMPLE DISCHARGE DEVICE USING AN ASPIRATOR
Misaki Makino
Shibuya Kyoiku Gakuen Makuhari High-School, Chiba, JAPAN

As standard discharge devices and spectroscopes are too expensive for high school laboratories, I have created a simple discharge device using an aspirator and a spectroscope using a DVD plate. Utilizing these devices, I succeeded to analyze the light emission spectra of gasses.<br><br> An aspirator was used as a decompression device since it can achieve fast decompression speeds and is easier to handle than existing standard devices, allowing us to see glow discharge easily. However, aspirators contain water vapor, which is usually considered a hindrance to observing bright line spectra of sample gases. In the handmade spectroscope, an ordinary DVD plate was used as a diffraction grating and a cylinder was put for a camera lens on the spectroscope. This enabled the observation of bright line spectra, which could be photographed due to the high resolving power of the DVD plate. <br><br> The distribution of the brightness of emission lines in these spectral photographs can be transformed into x-y graphs using image analysis software. A difficulty of the analyses seemed that the origin (the x-coordinate for the wave length) for each graph was uncertain, preventing the comparison and identification of multiple gas spectra. However, since the spectra of H2O appear in every photograph, we succeeded to make identification of gasses by using H-alpha; as the reference point of the spectrograms. <br><br> In conclusion, I developed a simple discharge device using an aspirator and a handmade spectroscope using a DVD plate, which can be used for the successful identification of gasses.

CHLADNI VIBRATION PATTERNS OF A STRING INSTRUMENT
Yeilyn Darice Colon

Abstract: <br><br> The purpose of this investigation is to show that the sound of a Puerto Rican cuatro, an instrument with ten strings is brighter if its top plate is made out of cedar instead of yagrumo. Yagrumo is a native tree of Puerto Rico. The sound brightness is an audio description and can be evidenced by additional high pitched frequencies in the spectrum analyzer. The more high pitched frequencies, the brighter the sound is.<br><br> The experiment consisted of spectrum analyzing the sound of resonant frequencies giving Chladni vibration patterns. First, the resonance peaks were searched between the frequencies 50Hz and 1000Hz in one interval, and between 1000Hz to 3000Hz in five Hertz interval, of both wooden plates. The first resonance peak in the cedar wooden plate is 66Hz, and 88Hz for the yagrumo plate. If the resonance peak had a Chladni pattern, the frequency's spectrum was analyzed using the computer program Data Studio. The spectrum analyzer graphs were compared and they determined that the cedar wooden plate had registered higher sound frequency resonance peaks therefore, give a brighter sound.<br><br> The most important discovery was to have shown that the cedar plate is acoustically brighter than the yagrumo plate. An instrument made out of cedar would be more convenient to use in the high pitched voices of an orchestra rather than one made out of yagrumo. Chladni Patterns formed at the higher frequencies with the cedar plate were more elaborate than the patterns formed at the higher frequencies with the yagrumo plate.

CORRELATION BETWEEN THERMAL BEHAVIOR AND MOLECULAR NETWORK IN RUBBER
Yun-Chu Wang
Taipei Municipal First Girls' Senior High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

Rubber band is sometimes used as a projectile weapon because it is able to store mechanical energy and release it to accelerate. While playing with a rubber band, I noticed a temperature rise as it is being stretched. Even though the temperature change (dT) is quite small, the discovery nevertheless triggered my curiosity about the mechanism involved. I carefully studied the temperature change for different rubber materials and different geometries to examine the correlationship between dT and the stretched length dL. Meanwhile, a literature search showed that rubber is a polymeric material consisting of long-chain molecules, which can entangle with each other. As the rubber band is stretched, the polymers become more aligned and less disorder. The latter should lead to a reduction in entropy dS, and consequently a release of heat Q follows the law of thermodynamics: Q = TdS. Since the experiments were made semi-adiabatically, the heat yields a temperature increase dT = Q/mc, where m and c are the mass and specific heat, respectively. Finally, I examined the entangled polymer bundles of rubber with transmission electron microscopy, and a model was constructed to explain the seemingly mysterious phenomenon.

DANCING WATER DROPLETS
Te Hsin Tsui
National Hsinchu Girls' Senior High School, Hsinchu, Taiwan, CHINESE TAIPEI

Have you ever wondered why water droplets dance on a Japanese teppanyaki hotplate surface or even on a frying pan? The water droplet usually does not evaporate immediately on the hot surface, but forms various regular shapes and dances around. To follow its dances, we designed a simple experiment to observe the behavior of water droplets on a heated plate. We found that the water droplets always form polygons first and the complexity of the polygons would dwindle to circle or oval as the volume of the droplets decreased by evaporation. The larger the volumes of the droplets, the more variations in shape were observed. Moreover, while the droplets transform into other shapes, the droplets would oscillate violently and spin around. With a high speed camera, we found that the oscillation frequency is controlled by the size of the droplets and the temperature of the hotplate. With a few exceptions, for regular patterns, the frequencies of the oscillation can be understood by a model proposed by Rayleigh to describe the natural oscillations of a liquid. In this model, the frequency of the oscillation of the drop is inversely proportional to its volume.

SQIF SETUP FOR MEASUREMENTS OF EXTREMELY LOW ABSOLUTE MAGNETIC FIELDS
Anne Yuri Polyakov
Ward Melville High School, East Setauket, NY

Information in superconductor circuits that are to be used in prospective super fast computers is presented by the value or sign of the stored magnetic flux. As an unavoidable drawback, these unique circuits are highly sensitive to the ambient magnetic field that ideally should be less than approximately 0.2 nT for their correct operation. Sophisticated magnetic shields are currently employed for shielding of the Earth’s magnetic field. However, the very low temperatures that are required for these circuits make it difficult to monitor and therefore compensate the residual magnetic field with proper accuracy. In this work, the magnetometer setup was built, which utilizes an ability of the Superconducting Quantum Interference Filter (SQIF) to be used for absolute (without offset) zero-field detection. The setup is capable of measuring absolute magnetic fields with a record accuracy of 3.5 nT, which is 25 times better than the accuracy of known counterparts. The setup is optimized for real-time monitoring and active compensation of residual magnetic field in the vicinity (less then 1 mm) from the superconductor circuit under test. Using the setup, the residual magnetic field and shielding capabilities of magnetic shields made of µ-metal, Bi-2223 High-Tc superconductor ceramic and lead were measured and compared. It was also shown that the setup can be used for direct measurements of the magnetic field produced by magnetic vortices trapped in a superconductor chip. This feature presents a novel way of monitoring and avoiding the trapping of magnetic fluxes in superconductor chips.

MECHANICAL "LEFT-HANDED" MEDIA
Ivan Vladimirovich Kortunov
Advanced Education and Science Center - Kolmogorov School, Moscow, RUSSIA

The unusual materials with both negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability were predicted and were named «left-handed media». In case of their existence they would show a number of interesting properties in optics and electromagnetism. The main properties are: opposite wave propagation phase and group velocities; negative refraction at the «left-handed» and «right-handed» media boundary. The latter property allows the creation of a "perfect" lens from such materials. The announcement of the practical realization of the left-handed materials for some frequency range of electromagnetic waves initiated a lot of works from various authors. So it is of great interest to investigate whether it is possible to construct media with similar properties for mechanical applications and to study their properties. The main aim of my work is the theoretical development of known «left-handed» materials' properties from electromagnetic to mechanical media. Such transition cannot be done directly because of the longitudinal polarization of the acoustical wave in contrast to the transverse polarization of the electromagnetic waves. I define the media as «left-handed» if the phase and group velocities have opposite directions so as it was in the electromagnetic media. The conditions for practical realization of such media were studied. As a result the simple one-dimensional mechanical medium, consisting of resonators connected by springs, was developed. It was proved that in some frequency range the medium displays the aforementioned feature of «left-handed» media. Besides, it was important to find the analogue for magnetic permeability and permittivity in the mechanical media and to explain their physical meanings. It was proved that the effective mass of resonators and compressibility become such analogue, the physical meaning of their negative values was explained. The physical requirements for the mechanical «left-handed» media's practical construction have been determined and their reliability has been shown.

ABOUT CROSS-WAVES ON A FREE SURFACE OF A LIQUID

Centre of Mathematical Education (LCME), Saint-Petersburg, RUSSIA

In this work an attempt to examine waves on a liquid surface, that cross the capillary waves and arise as a result of vertical oscillations of partially dipped into the liquid sphere was carried out.<br><br>The mechanism of cross-waves formation is still uncharted. We can only say that it is associated with a hydrodynamic instability on the liquid surface that may appear as a result of surface area variation.<br><br> Hard hemisphere which diameter is 4.2 mm was used. It vibrated with 50 Hz frequency. The amplitude of oscillations could be varied from 0 till 0.6 mm. During the experiments water, ethanol and glycerine which temperature varied from 20 to 100°c were used.<br><br> It was determined that appearance of this waves depends on parameter P=a*a*f/v, where f is a frequency, a – an amplitude, v – a kinematic viscosity. If P is more than P1 cross-waves will arise. But disappearance of the effect will occur when P equals P2, where P2 is less then P1 (an original kind of hysteresis). It can be seen that P is in fact a Reynolds number. So we can suppose that flows carry out the liquid on its surface are formed near the sphere - that is why the hydrodynamic instability appears. As a real-life result of this work it should be noted that if we know a frequency and an amplitude of oscillations, when cross-waves arise, we can simply find out a liquid viscosity.

AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE ENERGY TRANSFER PRINCIPLES ON CLASSICAL AND REALISTIC ROTATIONAL BLACK HOLE MODELS
Taylor Michael Sullivan
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

This research project creates both a classical and realistic model of a non-polarized black hole. The mathematical expressions were derived from basic equations describing flux and cooling of blackbody radiation in addition to Schwarzschild equations describing temperature and radius of a black hole. An omega variable was also utilized to account for changes in the radius of the event horizon, surface area of the event horizon, and temperature of the black hole associated with rotational effects. The classical model shows the behavior of a standard Schwarzschild black hole which is subjected only to Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation; the realistic model reveals the behavior of a rotating, non-polarized black hole which is subject to both Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and Hawking Radiation effects. The mathematical models derived were both determined to be differential equations in an unsolvable form, and therefore a finite sum-—Euler’s method-—was used to determine behavior and gather data. A variety of situations were tested via an automated computer program, which allowed the study to gain accurately-approximated data. Data gathered in the study revealed that realistic modeling of black holes provides a substantially different picture of behavior than a classical model would have shown. The black holes modeled prove the dramatic effects of Hawking Radiation, which causes almost all black holes to evaporate except at unusually high masses. Also, this study shows that rotational effects--even at very low omega values—-have a significant impact upon the overall development and behavior of the black hole.

IT'S ABOUT TIME: A PROJECT THAT TESTS WHETHER TEMPERATURE AFFECTS DIGITAL WRISTWATCHES IN THEIR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY KEEP TIME
Andrea Marie Carter
Noblesville High School, Noblesville, IN

This project examined whether or not a modern quartz-based electronic wristwatch will keep more accurate time when worn constantly on the wrist. To determine this, the effect of temperature on the accuracy of a watch was examined. Research has shown that a watch’s timing element, a tuning fork crystal, follows a parabolic-shaped drift curve that is temperature dependent and has a zero drift point near body temperature. <br><br>The experiment was conducted by placing six watches in five different temperature environments: -8°C, 8.5°C, 21°C, 40°C and 58°C. A GPS receiver was used to provide a precise time reference because its accuracy allows even small changes in a watch’s timekeeping to be measured. Data was recorded once daily to measure the watches’ time drift. This drift was measured for one week in each environment for each watch. Analyzing the cumulative time change for each watch by environment showed that the watches, whether heated or cooled, lost time with respect to room temperature drift. At room temperature, most watches had only a very slight time drift from the GPS reference.<br><br>Each quartz-based electronic watch is unique in its timekeeping ability. Each watch has a slightly different rate of gaining or losing time. From research, it can be observed that each watch will have a temperature point where it will keep nearly perfect time. Matching this point to external body temperature (~30°C) would make the watch very accurate when worn.

STUDY ON COSMIC RAY FLUCTUATION AS A FUNCTION OF ANGULAR ATMOSPHERIC ATTENUATION
Jun Ying
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

This project is the result of muon detection experimentation on the effects of angular atmospheric attenuation on cosmic ray fluctuation. The idea was to determine the relationship between flux rate and mass of attenuating air, calculated by the integration of atmospheric density and volume as a function of height above ground.<br><br> Scintillators were wrapped and connected to photomultiplier tubes, which in turn were anchored onto wooden boards. Voltage was tuned with oscilloscope to minimize noise. The two detectors were positioned 131 cm apart vertically. Detection involved coincidence of the two detectors during 24-hour periods. Angle of detectors was varied. The total event count was used to calculate flux rate. <br><br> The mass of 1.6704E+11 kg was found corresponding to an average flux rate of 0.547 counts/min/cm² at 0° (normal to the ground). When the mass increased by a factor of 1.528 by turning the detectors 30° from the normal, the flux rate decreased by a factor of 1.459. The resulting graph of the calculated attenuating mass vs. cosmic ray flux rate showed an indirect, linear relation between the two (f=-2E-12m + 0.8862). Thus, the attenuation of cosmic rays by the mass of atmosphere was demonstrated and correlated to cosmic ray penetration count.<br><br> Cosmic-ray-caused cancer is a major concern in future space mission to mars. Relating mass attenuation to cosmic ray hit count introduces the possibility of high density material’s functioning as a substitute for the earth’s atmosphere in attenuating the effect of high-energy cosmic rays on spaceships.

CORRELATIONS BETWEEN INTERGALACTIC LIGHT AND SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLES SHED LIGHT ON GALAXY COLLISIONS IN COMPACT CLUSTERS
Keith Austin Hawkins
GlenOak, Canton, OH

In modern astronomy galaxy collisions are elusive due to our inability to view them in real-time. This investigation attempts to resolve that problem by studying two properties whose evolution results from galaxy collisions. The profiles and correlations between these two properties hold important clues about the processes involved in galaxy collision. Intergalactic light (IGL) is used to study off-centered collisions as a result of high a high impact parameter. The properties of the IGL hold key details on the accretion history and dynamic evolution of galaxies in clusters. Super massive black holes (SMBH) are used to study centered collisions as a result of a low impact parameter. This study investigated the collisions of galaxies in five Hickson compact clusters measuring the correlation between average mass of SMBH and IGL (at the +26.5 mag/sq. arcsec isophote). Data sets for the clusters were complied from the atlas of compact groups of galaxies; remaining data was collected from the Hyperleda data base. Results show the average mass of a SMBH in a compact cluster is proportional to the negative of the square of the IGL luminosity. This relationship indicates there is a deeper connection between SMBH and galaxy evolution than previously thought. This investigation suggests that the impact parameter is time-dependent such that galaxy collisions in compact clusters become more off-centered with time.

NEW COMPONENTS IN ACCRETION DISKS: EVOLUTION OF THE LIGHTCURVE IN WZ SGE
Matthew James Walentosky
Oil City High School, Oil City, PA

Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astronomy; being present in stellar formation, neutron stars, supermassive black holes and specifically to this project cataclysmic variables. This study used mid IR time series photometric observations at 4.5 and 8 microns from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, two optical light curves in the I and R bands from Perth Observatory’s 14 Inch Robotic Telescope, and a chronological timeline of previously published light curves of WZ Sge over the past half century to investigate the dynamics of this cataclysmic variable star. The unexpected eclipse at 4.5 and 8 microns appears to provide evidence of a previously unknown outer dust ring surrounding the optically visible accretion disk. The eclipse at 4.5 and 8 microns is wider than at optical wavelengths indicating the dust ring is too cool to emit in the higher optical frequencies.<br><br>The results may significantly amplify the size of all accretion disks, resulting in major implications on current models for the components of accretion disks. In addition, these findings suggest that all previously derived brightness values of accretion disks which did not take into account the potential cool outer dust ring may be inaccurate. Since an outer dust ring would decrease the amount of energy reaching telescopes here on Earth, current brightness values for accretion disks in super-massive black holes, neutron stars, and protostars would be inaccurate. The result may be distance calculations to all such objects, which depend so heavily on accurate brightness values, will need to be recalculated.

GOING WIRELESS
Tiffany Nicole Young
DeKalb County High School, Smithville, TN

Is it possible to transmit voltage through the air and earth during normal outdoor conditions? If it is, how much voltage can be transmitted? Will transmission through the air transmit more voltage than transmission through the earth, or will transmission through the earth fare better than transmission through the air? <br><br> To answer these questions I made a tesla coil for a transmitter and a receiving coil to transmit and receive voltage. I also made antennas for transmitting and receiving through the earth and air. I tested the transmission at four different distances above and below ground with four “trials” for each test. For each “trial” I took four measurements and averaged them. <br><br> After I concluded all of my testing I found that more voltage could travel through the air than it can through the earth, but more voltage is lost over a distance. With transmission through the earth less voltage can be transmitted, but less voltage is lost over a distance. <br><br> I noticed that when there is less distance between the two coils that a higher voltage could be transmitted. So, in conclusion, above ground transmission with the distance of 22.9 cm allows the most voltage to be transmitted, and below ground transmission with a distance of 91.5cm or 36 inches transmits the least voltage. However, below ground transmission lost less voltage over distance than above ground did.

ROTATION CURVES IN FIVE DIMENSIONS
David Alex Rosengarten
John L. Miller Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY

The motion of stars within galaxies indicates that they are influenced by far more matter than is visible; this missing mass is called dark matter. By studying stellar orbital velocities as functions of the distance from galactic cores, one can probe the matter distribution. Observed rotation curves suggest that dark matter forms a halo that contains most of the mass of galaxies and extends far beyond the luminous material. Actual galactic structures are complex, and different models give different rotation curves. To avoid the complications of modeling matter, I consider vacuum solutions to Einstein's field equations in the form of black holes and black rings. In our physical four spacetime dimensions, black rings do not exist, but in five dimensions they do, and they provide a theoretical laboratory for studying how the nonlinear structure of General Relativity could modify rotation curves. I analyze circular geodesics for two classes of exact five dimensional solutions to Einstein's equations to obtain a model of rotation curves. By comparing to the Newtonian limit, I find that General Relativity, in principle, can warp rotation curves and provide an alternative to dark matter halos. However, for realistic masses and rotation rates of galaxies, my results do support the existence of dark matter.

SPATIALLY RESOLVED IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY OF SATURN'S SATELLITE DIONE
Morielle Mathanja Stroethoff
Hellgate High School, Missoula, MT

In 2004 the Cassini spacecraft entered the Saturn system as part of NASA’s Cassini-Huygens mission. Cassini is equipped with a Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) which collects spatially resolved imaging spectroscopic data. No work, however, has been completed in modeling the different regions of Dione’s surface to determine their composition. Local patterns on the surface of Dione point towards a bombardment of dark material from the trailing side. This study utilizes Shkuratov’s rigorous scattering model and data collected with VIMS to model the bright and dark regions of Dione. A mixture of 7% amorphous carbon mixed intimately with water ice and 5% ice tholin mixed molecularly with water ice (grainsize 15 microns) was the best model for the High-Albedo Regions. A mixture of 12% amorphous carbon mixed intimately with water ice and 5% ice tholin mixed molecularly with water ice (grainsize 10 microns) was the best model for the Low-Albedo Regions. The dark material that appears to have been deposited on Dione from the trailing side could be amorphous carbon mixed with ice tholin, or the components that form ice tholin: methane and nitrogen. In continuation of the project, the Nedler-Mead Simplex method will be used to systematically derive the most similar models to each region of Dione.

NOVEL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE STATIC AND KINETIC BEHAVIOR OF LIQUID MARBLES: A POTENTIAL UTILITY IN DIGITAL MICROFLUIDICS?
Nilesh Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, CA

Liquid marbles, first created in 2001, are formed when a liquid such as water, is encapsulated within a skin of super-hydrophobic powder; this protective skin results in the droplet’s complete non-wetting of its substrate. My primary aim was to develop a more complete understanding of the static and kinetic behavior of these liquid marbles in addition to investigating their applications in microfluidics.<br><br> Mathematically, I derive a novel geometric description of liquid marbles in their static state by using an energetics framework. A physical model of their kinetic behavior is obtained by using a non-slip rotational model coupled with a simple scaling law, which accounts for viscous dissipation. Liquid marbles, used in experiments to corroborate the theoretical calculations, were created using water and micronized Teflon. High-resolution pictures of the marbles were analyzed to verify the geometric predictions obtained from the static model. Similarly, the kinematics of these liquid marbles were experimentally verified by monitoring how liquid marbles behaved on inclined planes. <br><br> It appears that this study has brought a more precise and broad understanding of the static and kinetic behavior of liquid marbles – less than 5% error was observed between the experimental/theoretical values. Correspondingly, the derived theory predicts a hyperbolic velocity law which explains some of the unusual movement patterns of liquid marbles. Liquid marbles’ applications to the field of digital microfluidics have also hitherto been unexplored; a proof-of-principle demonstration seems to suggest that liquid marbles would form-fit the needs of digital microfluidics and perhaps remedy a few of its problems.

INTERFEROMETRIC INTRIGUE
Laura Elizabeth McCauley
Clover Park High School, Lakewood, WA

The purpose of this project is to test the effects of a change in atmospheric conditions on laser accuracy in free space optical communications. The hypothesis states that if dry heat is introduced into the atmosphere of an interferometer, then the amount of fringe activity will increase as the ambient temperature increases because of greater optical turbulence. A small-scale Michelson Interferometer was constructed to test this hypothesis, and, by dividing two beams of light and then recombining them, any variations in wavelengths due to heat distortions are represented through the resulting fringe activity. <br><br> The results of the experiment support this hypothesis. The average number of fringes produced by the interferometer in a one minute period at room temperature, 19 degrees C, was 0.45 fringes, but with an increase in temperature, fringe activity began to increase markedly. At 43 degrees C, there was an average of 0.55 fringes measured; at 57 degrees C, there was an average of 0.65 fringes measured; and 67 degrees C, there was an average of 1.4 fringes measured, more than three times as many as measured at room temperature. <br><br> This data would support the theory that the environment does have an impact upon the physics of a passing laser beam. Laser beams in free space optical communication systems are in constant and unprotected contact with the natural elements of wind, water vapor, pressure variations, particulate matter, and heat fluctuations. These environmental elements have the potential to disrupt the data-encoded laser beam, and the results of this testing prove that, at least in the case of temperature variations, the laser beam is in fact impacted as it travels through areas of higher and lower heat.

INTENSITY AND TEMPERATURE VARIANCE IN SONOLUMINESCENCE
Lyric Elizabeth Gillett
Cornerstone High Homeschool, Houston, TX

Sonoluminescence is the process in which light is produced through ultrasonic pressure waves causing the expansion and subsequent collapse of a single gas/vapor bubble, held in an ultrasonic standing wave pattern, in water.<br><br> The purpose of this study was to determine whether variation in water temperature would affect the light intensity produced from sonoluminescent bubble. <br><br> It was hypothesized that the light intensity from sonoluminescent bubble would establish a clear trend as the temperature of the water increased.<br><br> Equipment was procured and necessary apparatus adapted to produce sonoluminescence.<br><br> A photomultiplier tube (PMT) was aligned to capture the light emitted by sonoluminescent bubble, which was produced through significant testing sequences. PMT was connected to a lock-in amplifier operating in resonance with the ultrasonic transducer. Amplifier output and water temperature were recorded throughout experimentation. <br><br> Though not part of the original experimental design, the initial experimentation suggested a positive correlation between the drive level of the transducer and the light intensity from sonoluminescent bubble. Therefore, further experimentation was conducted in which the transducer drive signal and frequency were continuously optimized as the water temperature rose.<br><br> After data was graphed and analyzed, it was determined that there was a decrease in sonoluminescent intensity as the water temperature increased. <br><br> In summary, the data supported the initial hypothesis. That these results could assist in facilitating and advancing studies in sonoluminescence, by being indicative of the optimal temperatures at which to conduct sonoluminescence research relating to further study of energy and nuclear reactions, is the profound hope of this researcher.

ASTROPHYSICS CONDITIONS OF CARINA NEBULA
Charles Anthony Lozada
Ramon Power Y Giralt High School, Las Piedras, PUERTO RICO

Carina Nebula is one of the most spectacular nebulas of the galactic space, and it is hated up by dozens of massive stars. The problem was what is the electronic temperature [Te] of Carina Nebula? The hypothesis was: the electronic temperature of Carina Nebula is going to be in the range of 10,000K. The data used for this investigation was the emission of the recombination lines of ionized hydrogen obtained from different coordinates in the Carina Nebula. A university research group obtained this data using the radio telescope of New South Wales, Parks Australia. Theoretically the ionization state of the nebula maintains a Te in the realm of 10,000K. The data was analyzed using the computer operative system, Linux. The intensity of the emission from the recombination line and emission from the continuum line was obtained from this analysis. <br><br>To calculate Te was assumed that the gas emission is produced in a thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore was possible to use the expression: <br><br>Here Tc is the temperature observed in the continuum radiation, and is the potency of the recombination line. The formulas and were used to obtain the electronic temperature and the average of the Te taken at the different galactic coordinates respectively. The formula was used to get the experimental error.<br><br>The analyzed data showed that average electronic temperature in Carina Nebula is 9,646 with an error of ± 556. This temperature is very close to the one in the hypothesis.

KINEMATICS BASED ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT MITIGATING PROPERTIES OF VARIOUS MATERIALS
Abdiel Ortiz
Colegio Radians, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

The mitigation of impacts is important in a variety of fields ranging from the protection of property to the protection of our life. In every day occasion, a wide range of materials are being used. The main criterion people have to choose a specific material has been the availability and the perception of how good is the object in absorbing impact. Inspired on the above, this reseach has the objective of testing how effective is a material mitigating impacts, given certain experimental conditions.<br><br>The following materials were choosen based on the availability, use history and potential for having impact mitigating properties: water, air, cotton, sand, rubber, wood, foam sponge, metal sponge, compressed air plastic, foam, gel, kapok tree seed covering, toothpaste and bubble plastic.<br><br>The experimental setting consisted in the use of a radio-controled car which was crashed into a wall made of the specific tested material. Data was obtained on the force at the moment of the impact, the deceleration caused by the impact, and the acceleration caused by the rebound upon the impact by means of vernier sensors deployed on the wall and in the car.<br><br>According to the data, the metal sponge was more efficient absorbing impact than the air. This shows, that there is a more efficient material than the one used commercially. Regarding deceleration, or the capacity to stop movement, the water and the cotton executed similarly to sand, a commonly used material on roads and high speed highways. Nevertheless, these two materials resulted in a smaller acceleration after rebound upon impact. When absorption of force is the intended goal, the best product is the metal sponge. In terms of stoping the vehicle, the best performance was observed by the cotton. Regarding reduction of the rebound acceleration, the best is the kapok three seed covering. In overall performance, the metal sponge, followed by water, are the materials more effective for the mitigation of impact (even better than the air). According to the data obtained, the collision of two equal materials can diminish the force of the impact. Also it was observed that when thickness in the layers increase, the performance of the materials was more deficient in all the experimental parameters tested.

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT DIFFUSION TENSOR PROPERTY OF PORCINE CERVICAL SPINAL CORD USING DT-MRI
Oliver Barrom Jeong
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI) is a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying nerve structures due to its ability to detect diffusive motion of water molecules. This project aimed to examine the relationship between temperature and anisotropic diffusivity of water in a highly oriented medium.<br><br> A high-sensitivity quadrature saddle RF probe was built to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the high-resolution DTI of excised porcine cervical spinal cord. The DTI experiments were performed on a wholebody 3 Tesla MRI system along 20 non-collinear directions of diffusion weightings, at 5 different temperatures (5 ~ 36 C) with 4 different temperature controlling methods. Data was analyzed using a lab-made DTI processing software to obtain axial and radial diffusivities and their corresponding directions.<br><br> The plots of axial and radial diffusivities indicate linear relationships for both components with temperature, yet the temperature coefficient and diffusivity of the axial component are much larger than those of the radial component. This signifies that diffusion is highly restricted by its background structure due to the limited mobility of water molecules orthogonal to the background orientation. Also, the temperature coefficient provides an accurate extrapolation data from room temperature to body temperature in DTI experiments.<br><br> The percent change of diffusivity per C (percent coefficient) doesn’t deviate from axial to radial or anisotropy to isotropy. This suggests that the effect of tissue dilation is minimal and thermal motion is a dominant factor in the movement of water molecules as seen by radial increase in diffusivity with temperature.

THE JOVIAN SHIFT
Stoyan Ivanov Ivanov
North Springs High School, Atlanta, GA

The purpose of this experiment was to create a simulation modeling the orbits of the planets in the Solar System and the effects a change in the Jovian mass would have on their orbits. The planets simulated included all of the inner and outer planets. Smaller objects such as asteroids and proto-planets were not included. The planets were assumed to have elliptical orbits about the Sun and were placed in a coplanar fashion along the Sun-Jupiter XZ plane and perpendicular to the XY orbital plane. The Sun and Jupiter were assumed to be in perfectly circular, binary orbits for every simulation. The barycenter and the period for the two were calculated prior to every simulation. The hypothesis is that at .08 solar masses, Jupiter’s gravitational perturbations will cause the ejection of only the inner planets.<br><br>The effects of Jupiter were simulated for .08, .16, .32, .64 and 1 Solar Jovian masses. Discrete calculations were performed to calculate the planetary orbits which were based on Newtonian mechanics. The control simulation was at standard Jovian mass. Each planet was simulated for 10 of its standard orbital periods.<br><br>The results showed that at .08 SM Jovian masses, all of the inner planets, except for Earth, were ejected. Saturn was also ejected while the other outer planets suffered mild orbital shifts caused by the increase in the Jovian mass. As the Jovian mass increased, the combination of the shifting barycenter and the gravitational effects of Jupiter caused all of the planets to be ejected.

TO BUILD A BETTER MOTOR: THE CONTINUED ANALYSIS OF PROPELLANT ADDITIVES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON COMBUSTION
Bryant Paul Finney
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

The goal of this project was to improve the performance of a model rocket propellant through the addition of other chemicals while retaining the safety and castability of the propellant. The original propellant consisted of potassium nitrate as the oxidizer and sucrose as the fuel, and the ingredients added came from blackpowder, a popular commercial propellant. Three propellants were formed by mixing elements of the two formulas. The first two propellant formulas were based upon blackpowder, with sulfur replaced with sucrose in different amounts to reduce the risk of ignition and so the new propellant was as easy to cast as the original propellant. The third formula was to find any benefit sulfur provided to the propellant (aside from easy ignition). A fourth formula used a different, more powerful oxidizer. <br><br> Safety tests, pressurized burn strand tests, and static tests were conducted on the propellant. Safety tests included friction testing, impact testing, spark testing, and heat testing, and largely determined whether or not the propellant was to continue being tested. Pressurized burn strand tests were conducted to find the burn rate of the propellant at various pressures. Then, the formula with the highest burn rate was compared to the original formula during static testing, in which the propellants were cast into motors and tested on a static test stand. The specific impulse (a good measure of performance) was determined from static testing. The testing results clearly demonstrated that the second blackpowder formula drastically improved the performance, while the others reduced it.

HIDDEN SOUNDS
Ellen Marie Price
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

The question in this experiment was this: If a musical instrument’s sound is analyzed for frequencies, then can that instrument be identified by the harmonics in the sound? The answer to this question is important to musicians. Technologies that convert sound to musical notation could better identify instruments in the music. Similarly, if this experiment was carried further, noise cancellation could filter conflicting harmonics between instruments, if they were present. The hypothesis was that a musical instrument could be identified by the harmonics it produces.<br><br> The instruments tested were the clarinet, French horn, flute, piano, and pitch pipe, the control group. All of the recordings were taken in the same room, using the same microphone connected to a laptop. A sound recording program on the laptop recorded ten B-flat tones as played on each instrument. The Fast Fourier Transform program then recorded the magnitude of each frequency interval.<br><br> Two tests were performed on this data. The first test simply compared the loudest harmonics found in each group. These results did not support the hypothesis: Three groups’ results were very similar, while the remaining two seemed to contain no pattern. In the second test, magnitudes were extracted from the first seven bands that contained harmonics in the harmonic series. When displayed as percents of the total sound to which those bands contributed, the results of the second test supported the hypothesis. A computer program written to identify an instrument by these data was mostly successful on all instruments but the piano.

SCANNING LASER: MECHANICAL OSCILLOSCOPE, LASER TV, LASER PRINTER, LASER CAMERA, RADAR AND OTHER APPLICATIONS
Ertan Kuntman
Ordu Anadolu Lisesi, Ordu, TURKEY

By means of two vibrating mirrors we deflect the modulated laser beam to scan a rectangular screen and show that this scanning technique can be used as a mechanical oscilloscope or a video monitor. Advantages of this scanning laser technique are: Low power consumption (4 watts with a 100 mW laser), incresasing dimensions of picture with increasing distance, no lenses for focusing, pictures can be projected on any screen. Colour picture is possible with RGB laser and this scanning technique can also be used as fast laser printers which can print on any paper (by burning the paper) at the frame rate (i.e., 50 pages per second); CD and DVD data recorders (and readers) which can record data on a stationary plate (no motors involved) and many other industrial, medical, scientific applications of scanning laser. Besides these video monitoring applications, this technique can also be used for receiving light or any kind of radiation just like a video camera. In order to do this laser source should be replaced with a photomultiplier or some other kind of radiation sensor. As the mirrors oscillates and scans the space, incoming rays from the related portion of the space will reach to the receiving unit and will be detected. We belive that this kind of real time and real space receiving technique will have many advantages over conventional methods. We may also suggest that this scanning tecnique can be used for three dimensional applications.

THE SEARCH FOR HABITABLE TERRESTRIAL WORLDS AMONG THE STARS
Oscar Manuel Burciaga
Eagle Point School, Buckeye, AZ

A research project designed to search for potentially habitable extrasolar planets and moons is described. As of February 2008, 276 planets have been discovered circling stars other than the sun. The vast majority of these have been discovered spectroscopically, through the Doppler shift they produce in the star they orbit. In that it takes a massive planet to produce a measurable Doppler shift in most sun like stars, nearly all of these planets are likely to be gas giants on the order of Jupiter or Saturn, having no solid surface. However, all known planets of this mass possess moons, and the data indicates that more massive planets possess more massive moons. A planet circling a star at an appropriate distance with low excentricity, could have moons circling it that could support life. In addition, the tidal forces exerted on that moon by the planet and other moons, could keep the moon geologically active, so that volcanic activity could keep renewing the atmosphere and release water from the moons crust to form an ocean. Although such moons can not be detected currently, the planets they orbit can, and their presence may be inferred. Of the known extrasolar planets, many orbit very close to their stars. Some have highly eccentric orbits, but a few meet these criteria. Most of the known planets are examined in this research. The few that have the potential for moons that could harbor life will be discussed in greater detail here.

ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND ITS INFLUENCE ON FERRO FLUID CORRUGATIONS
Aqeel Rashaad Abdool-Ghany
McArthur High School, Hollywood, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the analysis of magnetic properties and its influence on Ferrofluid corrugation. The researcher investigated how neodymium, iron and cobalt played a factor in the number of corrugation. In phase 1 you will need a meter stick, magnets and a compass. To begin place the compass on the 50 cm mark and move the magnet to the 5 cm point. Gradually move the magnet in 5cm increments recording the degree angle until you reach 290 degrees. Then plot the distance vs. Tangent (x).This is needed to determine the magnetic field strength (B m).Neodymium strongest B field, followed by iron then cobalt. In phase 2 magnets mentioned above are placed under a 100 x 15mm Petri dish filled with 30 ml of Ferrofluid. The number of corrugations were counted showing Nd with a mean of 30 spikes, Fe yielded a mean of 5 spikes and cobalt had none. Since Fs = 16507 â‰¥ F05 = 3.15 the researcher will reject the null with a P â‰¥ .0001.This emphatically shows that Nd has more corrugations due to its greater B field while the iron is weaker and cobalt is the weakest. <br><br> <br><br> One can use Pauli Exclusion Principle to explain how the cations and orbitals can have an effect on the number of corrugation. Also by using the formula F=qv x B we see why and how the corrugation are formed. The applications for Ferrofluid can range from mechanical engineering to aerospace, and medicine.

HOW DO THE CHANGES IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM DRY VS. WET FABRICS HELP EXPLAIN THE APPARENT DARKENING OF A FABRIC WHEN IT BECOMES WET?
Ragnhild Cassel Noven
Bergen Katedralskole, Bergen, NORWAY

The purpose of this project was to investigate the apparent darkening of an object when it becomes wet. Several hypotheses were developed, some based on previously published material. The main hypotheses were based on absorption of light by the water, changes in scattering of light, increased internal reflection and increased transmission.<br><br>During the investigation, the reflected light from fabrics in dry and wet state was measured with a spectroradiometer. The resulting data was analysed in order to see how the spectrum of the reflected light changed when the fabric was wet. In order to investigate the hypotheses concerning scattering and transmission of light, the spectrometer was placed in different positions in relation to the fabric during the measurements. <br><br>The analysis showed that the absorption of light by the water was not relevant for the apparent darkening. The hypothesis concerning scattering of the light also did not seem to fit the data. It was found that the hypothesis based on increased internal reflection of the light seemed more in agreement with the results. Also, the simple hypothesis based on increased transmission of the light was found to fit the data very well. This hypothesis was then extended to include some theoretical elements from the more complex hypotheses previously mentioned. <br><br>The conclusion is based on several factors playing a part in the apparent darkening, the most likely one being increased transmission of the light. The previously mentioned processes could help explain the increased transmission, or contribute to the explanation as separate factors.

LIFE ON MARS: IS IT POSSIBLE?
Saralynn Mae Davis
Saint John Public High School, St. John, ND

The purpose of my project is to determine whether or not it is possible for life to live in martian soil. With this information we could determine how life, including humans, could possibly survive on Mars. The problem I dealt with was 'Will bean plants grow in Martian soil better than Earth soil?'. From what I know about Mars, and how the rovers have barely made it through all Mars' dust storms, the soil is very thin and contains quite a bit of Iron Oxide. What I've learned about plants is that alot of nutrients are need for them to grow. With this information, I predicted that the bean plants will grow better in the Earth soil then in the Martian soil. To prove this, I had my science teacher order a replica of actual Martian soil, and went out and found some common Earth soil and some bean seeds. Then when we had all the materials we planted three bean seeds each of ten small pots, five filled with Earth soil and five with Martian soil. We then measured the weight of the pots, making sure that they were equal. We then planted the beans, watered them, measured the ph of the soil, and as they grew, measured the height and took observations about every other day. When all data was gathered I discovered that the beans planted in the Mars JSC-1 soil grew faster and taller then the beans planted in the common Earth soil. Also the beans planted in the Earth soil grew healthier and produced more bean pods and had thicker stems then the beans planted in Mars JSC-1. With this information, I discovered that life grows healthier in Earth soil then in Mars JSC-1.

CAN COMMON HOUSEHOLD ITEMS SHIELD A MAGNETIC FIELD?
Kenneth Wright Brooks
Lighthouse Christian Academy, Bloomington, IN

What affect do common household metals and items have on magnetic fields? Are they able to contain or shield the fields? I chose this area of science because it involved magnets, which have always interested me. I do not know everything about magnets and magnetism, but my intention is to discover if different household items and metals could shield a magnetic field. <br><br>My hypothesis is that THE ONLY MATERIALS that will shield a magnetic field are materials that are affected by magnets and magnetism. I think this because if a magnet does not affect a certain material, that material would have no affect on the magnetic field. I think that the materials that have an affect will shield the magnetic field if they ARE NOT touching the magnet. If these materials do touch the magnet, then the domains will become an extension of those magnetic properties and “organized” so they will temporarily be included as part of the magnet. <br><br>The experimental data supported my hypothesis. Only items that were attracted to the magnet could shield the magnetic field. Plastic, glass, wood, and the thin aluminum can did not affect the magnetic field and are not attracted to a magnet. Yet, a thin steel can, a thick stainless steel lid, an iron griddle, and a steel meat cleaver blade did shield the magnetic field by a measurable amount, causing the readings to be clearly different. These items ARE AFFECTED by magnetic fields.

A STUDY OF CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR UTILIZING THE NON-OHMIC PROPERTIES OF THE P-N JUNCTION
Michael Anthony Batista
Melbourne Central Catholic High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this project was to determine if a simple circuit could exhibit chaotic behavior by using a p-n junction component in the form of a diode through experimental analysis, mathematical precision, and simulation verification. The research hypothesized that chaos would occur via period doubling and could be verified by comparison with the Feignebaum limit, phase space analysis, and Fast Fourier Transform analysis (FFT).<br><br>Experimentally, the researcher set up an RLD circuit driven by a function generator. Two methods of data collection were implemented. First, the driving amplitude was held constant while the frequency of the signal was varied. Second, the frequency was held constant while the driving amplitude was varied. Data was recorded each time the function experienced a period doubling and the Feigenbaum limit was calculated for periods two, four, and eight for each set of data. The researcher was also able to conduct additional experimentation at a research institution where digital equipment allowed for phase space and FFT analysis as well direct data collection from the circuit. <br><br>Using the Simulink component of Matlab, the researcher was able to use model programming methods to define the current and voltage flow through the circuit. Conduction phase space and FFT analysis on the program, it was found that the results of the program echoed the results obtained from both sections of experimentation.<br><br>The researcher concluded that the RLD circuit was a viable source for chaotic behavior as evidenced by a low margin of mathematical error and definitive FFT results.

Gymnazium svateho Tomasa Akvinskeho, Kosice, SLOVAKIA

Our project is devoted to the study of interesting phenomenon when the liquid jet suddenly breaks into drops.<br><br>The intact lenght-"l" of the jet(before breakup into drops in dependence of the liquid height- "h" above the small nozzle of large container is sutdied for water, water dilution of detergent, sunflower oil, hot water and liquid nitrogen by analyzing photos.<br><br>For given value of "h" the smallest "l" was found for water, and the longest for oil at room temperature and decreasing value of "l" with increasing temperature of water. Near to the breakup wave like disturbances on smooth flow was observed and typical highly asymmetric double-cone shape profile around the pich point was found.<br><br>Dependence "l" on initial flow velocity was approximated by linear function. The connection of the slope with time needed for development of instability is suggested.<br><br>For given value of "h" there is a large uncertainty of "l" observed in our measurements and therefore new measurements were carried out taking sequences 15 photos per second. Analyzing photos we measured intact lenght "l" amd aôsp "l1"(smooth part of intact lenght where perturbations are not seen by eye)in dependence on time. We observe larger difference between "l" and "l1" values if "h" is higher and also larger scattering "l" and "l1" values.<br><br>In the case of liquid nitrogen there are many random irregularities on the jet surface and the shape around the pinch point is close to symmetric in contrast with all other measured liquids.

EXPLORE A DOUBLE-SHELL SUPERNOVA REMNANT G166.0+4.3
MengLing Chen, Wang Naiqi, 
Beijing No.80 High School, Bei Jing, CHINA

The supernova remnant G166.0+4.3 has a very strange shape: it consists of a small-shell in the upper half and a large-shell in the lower half. We have tried to explore this supernova remnant in radio band and see its magnetic field structure. We observed this supernova remnant using the Urumqi 25m radio telescope. We firstly measured the flux density of G166.0+4.3 at 6cm that is 3.5 ±0.6Jy, and found its spactral index is α～－0.35±0.05. Through our calculation and analysis to its irregular shape, we understand that G166.0+4.3 must be just one supernova remnant, because it has spectrum of one power-law, which means it has only one distribution of relativistic electronics that produce the radio emission. We also found that magnetic fields of the two shells mustly parallel to the Galactic plane, which strengthens the conclusion that explosion of the remnant in the interstellar medium of two layers with different densities.

DEVELOPMENT OF THREE DIMENSIONAL PHOTONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THROUGH A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH
Nischay Kumar, Tinya Cheng, 
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

Chip-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have undergone drastic changes in fabrication and utility in the past decade, but their potential has yet to be utilized on the industrial scale. The standard circuit utilized in science and technology is the electronic integrated circuit (IC), but IC processing speed is limited since it relies on the movement of electrons. PICs, however, rely on the movement of photons, which if harnessed could create ultrafast processing circuits with a multitude of applications. Traditional fabrication, which uses a top-down approach, results in PICs of increasing size as complexity of the circuits increase. The bottom-up approach was adopted in this research to realize multilayered PICs with interlayer communication. The goal was to develop an integration platform for fabricating chip-scale PICs with smaller footprints in a cost and time effective manner. This integration scheme will theoretically make PICs accessible to researchers to further accelerate their commercial usage. Soft lithography was used to create a two dimensional PIC, but the resolution capability of soft lithography posed a hindrance in creating reliable PICs of small footprints. Therefore, the focus shifted to a three dimensional PIC developed completely through photolithography. While several issues, such as the optimizing the planarization of surfaces in multilayered structures and QD aggregation and tendency to stick to the substrate, are unresolved, the realization of the objective is in sight. The PIC with monolithic integration of fundamental photonic functions will have a breadth of applications including bio-sensing, performing all-optical signal processing and optical amplification.

CREATION OF A METROPOLITAN COSMIC RAY DETECTOR ARRAY
Yvette Leung, Pragya Kakani, 
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

The particles of cosmic rays initiating Extensive Air Showers (EAS) hurtle towards Earth at tremendous speeds. Cosmic rays and their precise origins, however, remain a mystery. The ideal location for experimentation was hypothesized to be New York City. It boasts thousands of rooftop water tanks which are perfect for detecting shower particles. Data on these events is limited and every opportunity is crucial for data collection. The experiment consisted of building a detector using photomultiplier tubes which would rely on Cerenkov radiation to detect cosmic ray events. The effectiveness of this detector was proven by measuring data from an oscilloscope and comparing them to expected values. <br><br> Secondly, a hodoscope apparatus consisting of two scintillators was built to measure the pulse height of an incoming vertical muon. This would be necessary for determining the length traveled by the muon within the tank and therefore the direction of the ray. The effectiveness of the hodoscope was tested through a coincidence rate calculation and was proven to fall reasonably over the expected curve.<br><br> Finally, it was determined that a New York City array would be extremely effective for neutrino detection due to high detector density at higher zenith angles in comparison to other detector arrays. This was revealed with an in-depth analysis through coordinate rotations of a three-dimensional map of city water tanks. The research ultimately showed that a metropolitan cosmic ray detector is a new and exciting opportunity to solve some of the universe's best kept secrets.

LET RIP: THE PHYSICS OF PERFORATIONS
Ellie Townsend, Ciara McCarthy, Lisa O'Sullivan
Colaiste Choilm, Cork, Co. Cork, IRELAND

Perforations are used widely in everyday life for separating different materials; from stamps, to tissues, to plastic bags. This investigation aimed to explore the physics of perforations: how they work and how best to optimise them to create a flawless tear. Polyethylene plastic was selected as the material for study as it was easy to perforate cleanly and also transparent, which allowed the phenomenon of strain-induced birefringence to be used to analyse later results. Different ways to stress the material were explored, for example using different shaped and spaced perforations and applying force both uniformly and non uniformly. The reference behaviour of unperforated material under stress was characterized using a stress-strain curve and Young’s modulus analysis. To investigate the effect of perforations, the breaking forces of different widths of material with different shaped and spaced perforations under uniform and non-uniform stress conditions were measured. The breaking forces of the samples were significantly lowered under non-uniform stress, but perforation shape had no major effect. However, perforation shape was found to be critically important for achieving a clean tear. The reasons for this were investigated by filmed the samples breaking through two crossed ±45º polarizing filters. The isochromatic fringe patterns generated by the strain-induced birefringence in the material were used to analyze the strain in the region of the perforation to show how tearing occurred. It was found that slit type perforations spaced by gaps the same size as or smaller than the perforation length gave the cleanest tears.

A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS IN THE SOLAR WIND: INVESTIGATING THE STRUCTURE OF THE INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD
Maximilian Rial Hammer, Max Maron, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

It is established that solar wind is plasma emitted from the sun that bombards earth’s magnetosphere at an average velocity of 400 km/s. As plasma, solar wind has distinctive magnetic properties which directly impact the magnetic properties of the earth’s ionosphere. However the true nature of the solar wind’s magnetic component direction is unknown and currently under debate. There are currently two competing models which describe the magnetic field structure, complete randomization and diffusion of the magnetic field or total coherency and predictable directional flows. Solar wind magnetic field direction data was collected from a magnetometer aboard a spacecraft located at the L1 LaGrange point and is currently in a stable Lissajous orbit. The latitude and longitude equations along with the cosine delta equations were implemented. From these equations, graphical representations were constructed, comparing the latitude vs. longitude with cosine delta. This research attempted to show a statistical analysis of the solar wind’s magnetic field to provide insight into how it travels. The results of this research indicate that coherent flux tubes of directional normalcy was not supported. The diffused model was a better representation of the structure of the solar wind’s magnetic field, which was found to be a more random and tangled structure.

MEASURING THE SPEED OF GRAVITY USING OCEAN TIDE MODELS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOLAR AND LUNAR POSITION TRACKS
Eric Casavant, Alex Marshall, 
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Of the fundamental forces, gravity is least well understood. In fact, The speed at which gravity (or the graviton) is exchanged is one of the last unknown fundamental constants of nature. We have developed the first method to simply and accurately determine the speed of gravity, using ocean tide data in conjunction with solar and lunar position data.<br><br> The height of the tides imply a position of the sun and moon, because the tides are primarily caused by solar and lunar gravitational gradients. Let this position be known as the "tidally implied" position. We can then find the position of the moon and sun implied by visual evidence or an ephemeris. Let this be known as the "visually implied" position. Any difference between the tidally implied and visually implied position of the sun and moon can be be accounted for by a difference between the speed of light and the speed of gravity.<br><br> Preliminary results indicate a nearly instantaneous speed of gravity.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES (TIRE TREAD, MASS, SPEED) ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRANULAR RIPPLES
Nikita Dodbele, Connie Chee, 
Hayfield Secondary School, Alexandria, VA

Many factors lead to the development of the "washboard" effect, a formation of continuous bumps over dirt roads. Factors were tested, determining which contributes the most to the reinforcement of these ripples.<br><br>To test development of washboard, a circular apparatus was constructed, which spun for ten minute intervals. After, the wavelengths and crescent heights of each ripple were measured. When testing tire tread, three different tires were switched with different treads (no tread, straight tread, diagonal tread). When speed was tested, markers were placed on the apparatus, showing at where to spin when the marker came around. Three different placements of markers were used (one marker:97.5cm/sec, two markers:130cm/sec, three markers:195cm/sec). The last experiment tested mass of the wheel. Different masses were used, increasing the mass by using rolls of tape (one roll:184.27g, two rolls:368.54g). Data was collected, measuring the wavelength of each ripple.<br><br>Data shows that tread, was not a leading factor in the formations of these ripples, because similarity in wavelengths were shown, even when treads varied. Additionally, results illustrated that when speed increased, slight decreases in wavelength existed. When the mass of the wheel changed, wavelengths critically varied when doubled, they grew significantly shorter, and when tripled, wavelengths grew longer from the initial mass.<br><br>This concluded that the three of the starting three hypotheses were correct, tire tread having no effect, mass and speed being considerable variables to granular ripples. <br><br>Another noteworthy result is that granular ripples are inevitable, and formed even when variables were changed.

CONSTRUCTION OF A MECHANICAL PROTOTYPE OF A MICROTREMOR RECORDER BASED ON ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
Marvin Paolo Gonzales Ambrosio, Rachel Ruth Y. Cahilig, Adrian T. Patacsil
Philippine Science High School, Quezon, Metro Manila, National Capital Region, PHILIPPINES

Microtremor or ambient vibration analysis is one major site effect evaluation method presently used. The predominant frequencies of a site and existing structures obtained using this method serve as reference to the renovation/construction of structures. Such frequencies should be non-identical to avoid prolonged shaking when an extensive movement of the ground occurs as dictated by resonance effect. Since electronic ambient vibration recorders (eAVR) are expensive and inaccessible, a mechanical prototype was constructed. <br><br>The design of the mechanical ambient vibration recorder (mAVR) was based on the IRIS Seismograph which uses electromagnetic induction and highlights the direct proportion between the movement of the ground and the prototype lever. The testing of its accuracy was done with the recording of natural and induced ambient vibrations. The natural ambient vibration of a control site and a control stimulus was obtained using the mechanical prototype and the commercial recorder. WinWaveShot presented ambient vibration as seismograms which were converted to histograms and discrete Fourier transforms (DFT's) using DADiSP2002. The statistical analysis of these graphs was performed.<br><br>The DFT recordings obtained from the mAVR were proportional to those of the eAVR and indicated identical predominant frequencies from both recordings. With the proven reliability, the prototype, created from readily available and cheap materials, would serve as a potential alternative to commercial sensors. This can record actual movements and can obtain the right predominant frequency. For further studies, the ambient vibration of other sites must be obtained and compared to eAVR recordings.

WEAK LENSING MASS ESTIMATES OF LOW REDSHIFT CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES
Anthony J Yunker, Kelsey Lawhorn, Frances Mei Hardin
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other large angle surveys made it possible to study large angle, low redshift clusters of galaxies through weak lensing. For this project, data from the SDSS for twenty-two low redshift (z less than 0.12), rich clusters was analyzed to see if such weak lensing analyses were possible. These weak lensing analyses produced mass estimates for nine of the clusters and showed the SDSS to be a viable source of weak lensing signal for low redshift clusters of galaxies.<br><br> Twenty-two clusters from the c4 and Berlind catalogs were selected and the shear caused by each cluster was calculated using background galaxy shape data from the SDSS DR6. Then a Navarro-Frenk-White profile was fit to this shear and an estimate of the mass within the virial radius was derived for each cluster. Of the twenty-two low redshift clusters, nine of the clusters produced a mass estimate that was not consistent with zero, implying that the cluster mass was detected. <br><br> These mass estimates were dependent only on the mass and were the first such analysis performed on these clusters. These analyses have shown that the SDSS is a feasible source of lensing signal for these low redshift, large angle clusters of galaxies.

MATHEMATICALLY MODELING AND OPTIMIZING THE POWER OUTPUT OF A MAGNET/WIRE COIL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MORE EFFICIENTLY HARNESS ENERGY FROM OCEAN WAVES
Evan Bock Clark, Scott Lanyon Fleming, 
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

This project deals with mathematically modeling the effectiveness of an apparatus to harvest power from the up and down motion of ocean waves, and attempts to use this model to optimize certain design factors of the apparatus for maximum power output.<br><br> We developed the model using standard physics equations and tested it against experimental data, acquired by dropping a magnet through a conductive wire coil while taking various measurements. Predictions deviating from the experimental data raised the suspicion that some of the utilized equations are valid only in ideal situations. This led to corrections of the equations, influenced by experiment, accounting for previously neglected variables that do not exist in the ideal.<br><br> When the model was completed, we attempted to employ it to optimize the diameter of the wire in the coil for maximum power output. Unexpectedly, the diameter of the wire canceled out in the equation, showing that the diameter of the wire does not affect the power output of the system, so long as it is significantly smaller than the dimensions of the spool.<br><br> In conclusion, the contributions of this project are twofold. First, a mathematical model was developed to predict the power output as a magnet falls through a magnet/wire coil system. Second, it was shown which elements are important in the design of a wave power system, and which are not. These findings could be used to create a more efficient and cost-effective system to harvest power from ocean waves.

TRACKING COSMIC RAY MUONS USING A CLOUD CHAMBER
Leah Suzanne Wilson, Abby Lenhart, 
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Cosmic rays are all around, one such cosmic ray that strikes the earth is a muon. On average, one muon strikes the fingertip every single minute with a mean kinetic energy of about 4 GeV. In order to verify the muon flux count, a cloud chamber was constructed out of a basketball display case to determine the muon flux (number of muons hitting the earth’s surface per cm2) in the Louisville area. The cloud chamber was constructed to consistently produce an environment where muon tracks could be detected. Felt pads were saturated with 91% isopropyl alcohol inside of the chamber (only on the top and bottom sides) with the goal of creating a super-saturated atmosphere of alcohol within the chamber. The chamber was then set on a block of dry ice and was cooled to create the required environment for muon detection. In a dark room, with a constant beam of light shining through a side, cosmic ray muons were observed striking through the “alcohol fog”. In the cloud chamber the effective area of observation was about 100 cm2. During a 20-minute time frame in 5 different trials, an average of 119 muons was observed. The muon flux was calculated to be 0.06 events per minute per cm2 (or about 6 events/minute/100cm2) for the Louisville area, which is consistent with the hypothesis. The muon flux count was also compared with the muon flux data obtained from SLAC’s Cosmic Ray Detector.

THE EFFECT OF FREQUENCY VARIATION AND THE DETERMINATION OF OPTIMUM ELECTROMAGNETIC RESONANCE VALUES ON THE EFFICIENCY OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION COIL
Christopher Joseph Davlantes
Bishop Kenny High School, Jacksonville, FL

There are many uses for magnetic levitation devices. They can transport people and materials very quickly and efficiently and even lift objects to new, higher locations. Levitation apparatuses have so many applications because they are very efficient. These devices are so efficient due to the fact that they do not touch the ground. Since they do not touch the ground, they have very little friction to combat with. One type of magnetic levitation, levitation by the use of alternating eddy currents, appears to be very promising in the near future. Because it does not require immense speed to operate as maglevs do, this phenomenon could be used to produce a type of extremely energy efficient, slow speed magnetic train. The project was performed to determine the most efficient set-up for this type of levitation.<br><br>An electromagnetic coil configuration was created out of 0.4 mm solid copper magnet wire. The configuration was a simple, single coil of 30 loops with a diameter of 7.6 cm. Two different coil set-ups were constructed. One consisted only of a coil and a variable voltage transformer. The second consisted of a step-up transformer in conjunction with a variable frequency drive as well as a variable voltage transformer. Both set-ups were tested for magnetic levitation by running electricity through them that was regulated via variable voltage transformer. These two set-ups were subject to levitation height, thermal dissipation, and magnetic hit point tests over an aluminum plate. Data and graphs of the coil's magnetic fields were also collected and created by an electromagnetic field sensor. All data was organized into charts.<br><br>Analyzing this data led to the conclusion that it is possible to use less energy and make an electromagnetic induction coil more efficient by matching the input frequency of the coil to the core resonant frequency of the conductive plate above which is floats. This information could greatly assist in the development of low pollution, high speed vehicles that will not only lessen people's dependence on gasoline, but also make the earth a little bit cleaner.

HOW HOT? HOW FAST?
Alexander Jeffrey Angelo Cintron
West Port High School, Ocala, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if air temperature affects the speed of sound. The answer to this problem would help sound engineers determine the placement of equipment, like speakers, and the level of amplification. Two mics were placed 91.4 m (300 ft) from each other in large field: Both were connected to a laptop with the recording program “SoundStudio” running. One person would hit record on the laptop, making sure there were no other external noises present, and the other would hit a snare drum. After the partner with the snare drum did 4 or 5 solid hits, the partner with the laptop would hit stop on “SoundStudio.” This procedure was performed at different temperatures (independent variable) several times a day. Finally, the raw data from “SoundStudio” was used to calculate the speed of sound (dependent variable) for each temperature. Compared to the actual value of the speed of sound at 0ºC, which is 331.0 m/s, the average experimental value for the speed of sound at 0ºC was 331.2 m/s, yielding a percent error of 0.06%. The speed of sound at 13ºC on average was 339.2 m/s. The speed of sound at 26ºC on average was 347.1 m/s. Air temperature does affect the speed of sound. The colder it is, the slower sound travels and vice/versa. An experiment could be done to include wind and humidity to see if they have any affect on the speed of sound when traveling through air

RESEARCH OF BIOLOGICAL LIQUIDS SELF-ORGANIZATION PROCESSES UNDER THERMAL DEHYDRATION
Darya K. Stralenka
State Gymnasium #1, Vitebsk, BELARUS

The work means a sort of research related with phase change in the process of biological liquids components self-organization under thermal dehydration. Biological liquids dehydration was meant in the field far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The results read that biological liquids components self-organization in this case present generalized constitutive properties determining general rules for self-organization of both organic and non-organic substances in non-equilibrium conditions.<br><br>In the work there was used biological liquid model of distilled water, 10-13% albumin, 0.9%, NaCl. Dehydration of drops 0.1 ml. was held under 45-50 degrees centigrade on glass substrate at special heating device. After desiccation three forming zones could be considered: edge (dendritic forming), middle (radiosymmetrical forming), central (eutectic forming). And for each zone there is phenomenological estimation of supramolecular structures taking place at self-organization in non-equilibrium state. <br><br>On the basis of the experiments it's possible to make a conclusion that under dehydration in non-equilibrium state liquid components take forms different from ones they take after desiccation in equilibrium state. These forms mean high-textured order on macrolevel (dissipative microstructures), reflecting thermodynamically non-equilibrium state. Model behaviour and structure are in chime with the general theory of dissipative structures though there are some differences. The main thing about biological system is certain mechanism (still unknown), creating conditions for periodical repetition of non-equilibrium cycles.<br><br>Our approach allows to fix and hold quantitative and qualitative biological liquid investigation in cycles of its non-equilibrium state. The investigation could become quite useful for many trends in natural sciences (biology, medicine, veterinary medicine, biotechnologies), where it's important to speak about dissipative structures in different biological liquids.

A NOVEL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISM BEHIND DNA-DNA INTERACTIONS USING OPTICAL TWEEZERS
Sujay Tyle
Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, NY

Previous studies based on DNA interactions have always used histone binding proteins and other enzymes like RecA. However, no studies have been done in their absence. The invention of a three dimensional optical tweezers system reported here has helped define how DNA binds with other DNA in dynamic biological systems to provide an understanding of chromosomal pairing during reproduction. In contrast to a conventional optical trap, the newly designed and developed trap lacks a highly focused beam, greatly reducing localized heating and the associated risk to the biological specimen which could potentially cause errors in this type of investigation. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) and double strand DNA (dsDNA) interactions with their complements/analogs were studied in the absence of protein. The tweezers system was utilized for studying the DNA interactions using Biotin/Streptavidin and Digoxigenin/Anti-Dig linkage. <br><br><br> A Poisson distribution was modeled. The results showed preferential binding at 1-2X the radius of gyration, as optimal separation distance and between 2-10 minutes binding times, depending on the interaction and molecular structural differences. These novel results have provided access to the entire range of space covered by the dynamic DNA configuration changes and sheds light on optimal conditions for meiosis and provide insight into polyploidy induced genetic disorders leading to diseases, like Down’s Syndrome, the result of having inherited 3 copies of the 21st human chromosome, and Hemophilia, linked to the X chromosome.

A QUANTUM ALGORITHM FOR MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION
Yale Wang Fan
The Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR

Quantum computers could potentially simulate the dynamics of systems such as polyatomic molecules on a much larger scale and much more efficiently than classical computers. However, the main problem in developing quantum simulation algorithms has been constructing the necessary time evolution operators in enough detail for implementation in a quantum computer. This work presents, for the first time, a complete and very general solution to this problem: namely, a quantum computational algorithm for simulating an arbitrary many-particle system acting under the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation. The algorithm developed here can fully determine a system's dynamics rather than merely its ground-state energy, as discussed in previous literature. This research bears applications in condensed-matter physics, chemistry, and materials science.<br><br>As an ongoing project of 1.5 years, four main new results were obtained during the past year. First, the operators corresponding to two additional terms in the molecular Hamiltonian were constructed, resulting in a highly versatile algorithm that can simulate many-particle systems of any size governed by non-relativistic Coulomb interactions. Second, an exact diagonal form of the kinetic energy operator in the momentum basis was determined and proven by considering a continuum limit, thus eliminating the need for classical techniques or simplifications. Third, polynomial-time implementations of all operators were proposed. Fourth, numerical simulations of the algorithm were carried out in MATLAB for full molecular orbitals, building on the atomic orbital simulations of the previous year, and the results were compared to both analytical solutions and those produced by classical variational methods.

SOUND WHAT? SOUNDBOARD!
Kendra Gayle Trimble
Vici High School, Vici, OK

The purpose was to determine which wood made the best soundboard. My hypothesis was that varnished would be better than unvarnished and that maple would make the best soundboard because its elasticity, density, and grain would help the resonance and forced vibration in transducers. I did this experiment because I enjoy learning about music and sound.<br><br>To test this project I took five types of wood cut into the same dimensions and measured the decibels produced by a music box player tacked to the wood at one, five, ten, and fifteen feet away. Then I varnished the wood and repeated the procedure. The independent variable was the wood used and the dependant variable was the decibels measured. I followed all safety procedures and was supervised when I cut the wood.<br><br>My hypothesis was half right. The maple produced an average of 34.3 decibels and every wood but walnut out performed it. Mahogany was the best with 40.9 average decibels. Varnished was better than unvarnished in every wood except yellow pine, increasing the average decibels by as much as 13.5 decibels.<br><br>By doing this experiment I learned which wood makes the best soundboard. Some hidden variables were the grain count of the wood and how porous it was. To make this experiment more reliable I would test more types and sizes of wood and how density and elasticity affects the resonance. I learned how sound waves are produced, how to measure sound, and which properties of wood make effective transducers.

OPTICAL DETECTION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FOR HOMELAND SECURITY: PHASE III
Michael A. Gord
Dayton Christian High School, Miamisburg, OH

The Global War on Terror requires new techniques for detecting hazardous materials. If the characteristics of light scattered from the interaction of a femtosecond laser pulse and a hazardous material target are measured, then the distance to the target and the identity of the hazardous material can be determined.<br><br> An instrument was constructed based on LIDAR (light distance and ranging) and DIAL (differential absorption LIDAR) to measure the roundtrip time-of-flight to the target and back and the spectral absorption of the target. Targets included a mirror, a cloud of water vapor, a cloud of saturated KCl solution in water, and a Rb vapor cell (cold and heated). Independent variables were distance and target. Dependent variables were time-of-flight and laser absorption. All other variables were controlled.<br><br> From LIDAR-based measurements the distance to the target was determined, and the speed of light was calculated to be 3.003x10^8 m/s within 0.17% of the actual value (2.998x10^8 m/s.)<br><br> Rainbow DIAL was used to identify targets based on the return spectrum. No absorption was observed for a cloud of saturated KCl solution in water. Characteristic absorption features were observed for a heated Rb vapor cell at 780 nm and 795 nm.<br><br> The data support the hypothesis. The distance to a target and its identity can be determined simultaneously using the time-of-flight and differential absorption of a femtosecond laser pulse.<br><br> Applications include homeland security, industrial process monitoring, and atmospheric and environmental studies, including exploration of greenhouse gases and global warming.

HITS ON THE HILL: INVESTIGATIONS OF FORCES OF LOW LEVEL IMPACT TO THE HEAD DURING FREESTYLE AERIAL SKI JUMPING
Amy Jane David
Pinedale High School, Pinedale, WY

Freestyle aerial ski jumping is a sport with potential for impacts to the skier’s head. Impacts with acceleration changes that cause the brain to move inside the skull can result in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, which can affect cognitive function. Consequences of major impacts have been researched extensively, but not of low level impacts of routine jumping. This study investigated impacts to the head during various levels of routine activities in freestyle aerial ski jumping.<br><br> To begin, a baseline level for cognitive brain function was established as normal for the study subject using ImPACT. Protocol was set for repeating the test after 10g impact and following the cumulative season. Impacts to the head were monitored as the subject jumped, wearing an six-accelerometer instrumented sensor helmet, recording impacts of greater than 10g. Video and anectodal observations were scored to compare with quantitative sensor data.<br><br> Phase I evaluated landings of upright forward and spinning jumps in straight positions, and consistently resulted in impact levels of less than 10g. Video observational scores and the skier’s self-evaluative anecdotal recordings were closely aligned to the impact data, reconfirming low level impacts during landings from upright jumps. Phase II for monitoring impacts in inverted jump training is beginning, indicating higher video and anecdotal scores, but still not triggering the 10g threshold for the instrumented helmet. <br><br> The data thus far suggests that routine upright ski jump landings do not result in accelerations greater than 10g to the head. Further evaluation through ongoing Phase II inverted jumps will determine impact levels and potential contribution to Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and decreased cognitive brain function.

EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON RESISTORS
Tony Huang
F.J. Reitz High School, Evansville, IN

Resistors are used in order to create voltage drops in electrical circuits. Previous literature states that resistance values depend upon temperature. However, the behavior of resistance trends for different types of resistors in response to temperature is not fully understood. The purpose of this experiment was to study the temperature dependence values and trends of various resistors. Four types of resistors with different ohm values were used in this experiment. Resistors were submerged in various chemical slush and vapor baths ranging from -195.79°C to 218°C. Resistance was measured by a digital voltmeter after equilibrium was reached in the baths. Alpha and beta values, which are temperature coefficients of resistance, were determined for each resistor. Results showed that these resistors had a relatively small resistance change in response to a temperature range of 413°C. Most of the resistors showed trends with significant second-order behavior and a negative alpha temperature coefficient. This observed behavior was possibly influenced by the composition and ohm values of the individual resistors. The results of this study may be useful in understanding the relationship between temperature and resistance. Furthermore, this data could be applied to determine the most effective resistors in low temperature applications, as well as to investigate how to further improve resistor stability.

A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTERNAL REACTION DRIVE
Thomas Joseph Dauer
Castle High School, Newburgh, IN

For several years, NASA supported the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program, a major goal of which was to construct an Internal Reaction Drive (IRD), a drive that does not eject fuel or react with its surroundings. This experiment, A Novel Method for the Construction of an Internal Reaction Drive, was done to test the viability of a Center Of Percussion (COP) based internal reaction drive. The idea behind this drive is that angular momentum is effectively converted to linear momentum when a rotating pipe’s COP hits a firmly held rod, since the tangential force at the pipe’s axis is zero at the moment of the impact. If the pipe and rod were on the same wheeled cart, then the cart should theoretically constitute an IRD that can pass the pendulum test. Several experiments designed to reveal the underlying physics principles involved in such a drive were done, ultimately leading to the construction of the COP-based IRD itself. This IRD passed a watered-down version of the pendulum test. However, the average distance that the IRD caused the pendulum to move was small. Factors that could have yielded erroneous results were thoroughly investigated and found to be negligible; however, future research involving the construction of a COP-based IRD that will pass the pendulum test for a continuous period of several seconds must be done in order to establish the ultimate validity of the COP-based IRD concept.

MEASUREMENT OF THE MASS IN WEIGHTLESSNESS
Mikhail V. Churikov
Liceum # 13, Khimki, Moscow Region, RUSSIA

In orbital movement on a circumterraneous orbit in enough small sizes of a space vehicle in comparison with orbit radius gravity is practically counterbalanced by centrifugal forces of orbital movement. It does impossible measurement of size of weight by its equilibration in a gravitational field by known standards of weights. It does impossible also weight definition on the measured size of reaction of a support (force) or the measured size of deformation of an elastic element (spring). We will notice, and it is more low noticed in introduction that these static ways of measurement of weight with fixing of sizes of gravitational forces measure gravitational weight. But the weight acts not only in aspect of gravitational interaction, but also characterises also property of resistibility of a body to the forces, aspiring to change its movement, is an inert weight. In work questions are considered: - Uses of forces of magnetic interaction for creation to the measured weight of accelerations (linear and angular), fixings of linear and its angular movings after time, comparison of intervals of time with sizes for reference weights and calculation under this data of size of weight; - a theoretical substantiation of two schemes of measuring devices. The description of a design and a measuring part of the developed laboratory sample (breadboard model) of the device with which use experiments are made is resulted and estimations of accuracy of measurements of weight in a range ~ 5 are received. 20 gramme.

APPLYING KNIFE EDGE REFRACTION TO TURBULENCE DETECTION
John Anthony Bolander
Saint Xavier High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of this experiment was to develop an alternative method for detecting vortices or air flow disturbances in a wind tunnel. The goal was to make a cost-effective, yet quantitative method for measuring these disturbances. My hypothesis was that the different densities in the air would disturb the light in such a fashion that by focusing the light on a knife-edge I would be able to measure the change in intensity of light. To accomplish this, the light from a LED was collimated with a lens and an aperture at twice the focal length of a concave mirror. This light was observed at the knife-edge near the focus. A hot plate or the test chamber is place in the beam path. It was observed that even though the ripples of heat coming off the coils when the knife-edge blocked part of the beam, the entire image could still be seen, yet it was darker. Test were also made with collimated light in the test area. The hot plate test setup demonstrated a Foucault knife-edge test with a mirror shows the shadows of the ripples of air density. Turbulence was not seen coming off an object in a wind tunnel. Digital images revealed large disturbances in the air. Even with digital analysis, there was no distinct variation in the images from the wind tunnel. Further investigation can be done to determine why the heat waves became visible but vortices in a wind tunnel did not.

CAN A POLYMER BE MADE TO ACT LIKE A METAL AND EXHIBIT MAGNETIC PROPERTIES?
Michael Vincent Di Mascio
Waynesville High School, Waynesville, OH

Traditional methods of storing data use an electromagnet to charge a metal plate in binary code. The encoded data has low granularity and is susceptible to being erased by magnetic fields, solar flares and eventually self-erasure over time. However, none of these problems are potentially present in polymeric magnets. The spin directions of the polymer electrons in relation to each other represent the ones and zeroes in binary systems and can be encoded by modulating magnetic fields or the polarization of light. This experiment investigated the effect of laser wavelength in the photoinduced magnetization (PIM) of a polymer. It was hypothesized that blue laser radiation induces magnetization in a polymer. The polymers synthesized by the literature method were poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, as the control and manganese(II) and iron(III)-doped PMMA, each 2.8 centimeters in length. Faraday magneto-optic rotation with a Babinet Soleil Compensator, which was tuned to the inflection voltage of a photodetector, was used to measure the PIM of the polymer samples with a He-Ne, green and blue laser, 632.8 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm in wavelength, respectively. Two polarizers were set to extinction at 45 and -45 degrees with the polymer sample centered between inside the magnet coil 9 cm in length. The verdet constants of each polymer were measured using a magnetic field of 1119.4 gauss. Each polymer was irradiated for two hours with each cross-polarized laser. The angle of rotation was calculated from the voltage signal increase of the photodector to determine the magnetic field using the Faraday Effect. The blue laser increased the magnetization of the Mn(II) and Fe(III)-doped PMMA by 8.687 and 8.183 G, respectively, and the green laser relaxed these states at the rates of 1.478 and 1.701 gauss per minute, respectively. The He-Ne laser did not influence magnetization and the PMMA control remained unmagnified. The hypothesis was correct as originally assumed. This experiment can be applied to developing spin-based data and magnetic computer memory using photoswitchable polymeric magnets.

LASER INDUCED MICROFLUIDIC MOTION OF A LIQUID-LIQUID INTERFACE
William Cummings Newberry
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

The field of microfluidics has become increasingly important in the application of fluid motion in both physical and biological sciences. The ability to amechanically move picoliter quantities of a fluid may allow scientists to more easily create an artificial pseudocell as well as introduce nanodoses of medicine or genetic information into a cell. Previous studies in microfluidics have suggested that the interface of two immiscible fluids can be deformed to varying degrees by exposure to laser radiation produced by a high intensity Ar+ laser. These studies were performed on a microemulsion containing toluene, butanol, water, and sodium dodecylsulfate, which phase separates at a critical temperature of 35oC, the lowest temperature at which the interface can be deformed. The current study has confirmed that a soft interface between two immiscible liquids can be deformed in the direction of the laser beam by as much as 25-30 micrometers when stimulated for 50 seconds by a solid state laser. This deformation increases with the time of exposure to the laser radiation. The second phase of this research investigated the ability of a colloid particle to move from a miscible liquid, through a soft interface, into a liquid of limited/no miscibility, at subcritical temperatures. Organic Quantum Dots, or fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, have an index of refraction that is similar to the top phase of the above mentioned microemulsion, when dissolved in decane. These quantum dots were flocculated into a colloidal microemulsion, and stimulated with a solid state laser at room temperature. Measurable deformation of the interface was observed. Analysis of the 545 nm fluorescent emission within the bottom phase microemulsion suggests that the quantum dots from the top phase move across the interface into immiscible bottom phase, at a rate exponentially related to the time of laser exposure

A STUDY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REYNOLDS NUMBER, POLYGONAL VORTICES, AND SATURN'S POLAR HEXAGON, A THIRD YEAR STUDY
Aaron Mitchell Stecker
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, FL

The purpose of these experiments is to answer the question, “How do Reynolds Number and boundary layer affect the phenomenon of polygonal vortices? Further, what happens when the disc used in the experiment does not fit in the container? Also, how does the experiment being conducted in the lab relate to Saturn's polar hexagonal storm?” Three container sizes (15.4 cm, 20.4 cm, and 24.5 cm) and two plate sizes (15.3 cm and 20.3 cm) were used, along with two different fluids (water and ethylene glycol). The disc being experimented with was attached to the threaded rod, and suspended in the container. It was spun at a predetermined set of frequencies and heights. After analysing the data, it has been determined that Reynolds Number has very little involvement in the determination of the vortex shape. Size of the spinning plate as compared to the size of the container has been found to impact the vortex incurred, boundary layer has been found to have a great deal of influence on the shape of the vortex, and depth of the fluid has been found to have an even more profound impact, second only to the frequency of the spinning disc.

A NOVEL METHOD FOR MEASURING SONOLUMINESCENT SPECTRA
Lyric Elizabeth Gillett
Cornerstone High Homeschool, Houston, TX

Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SL) is the process by which light is produced through ultrasonic pressure waves causing expansion and subsequent collapse of a single gas/vapor bubble, levitated in an ultrasonic standing wave pattern, in liquid. <br><br> Purpose: To develop innovative method to aid further investigation and measurement of SL emission spectra, not inhibited by absorption of photons of shorter wavelengths by the liquid implemented in SL process, as current methods for measuring SL spectra and temperatures are problematic and insufficient. <br><br> Hypothesis: The introduction of fluorescent dye into the liquid in which SL process occurs would assist in facilitating measurement of SL emission spectra.<br><br> Experimental setup utilized a spectrometer to isolate individual emission wavelengths, while measuring intensity with photomultiplier tube, and a lock-in amplifier, to ensure desired measurement. Initial experimental phase was conducted to determine requisite parameters for dye, and measurements were calibrated. SL emission excited fluorescent dye in visible range at peak wavelength of 460nm, revealing that certain portion of UV light is emitted to excite dye. Though actual spectrum of luminescence was not measured, dye is indicative of UV signals in emission. Certain dyes may be used to identify specific UV (and other) electromagnetic radiation emitted from bubble. <br><br> Conclusion: Data supported initial hypothesis. Utilization of fluorescent dye, with excitation wavelength in UV <300nm and emission in visible (460nm) made it possible to detect otherwise absorbed emission spectra. Future study and research, directed toward applications measuring SL spectra, will include testing with nanoparticles and different dyes excited by electromagnetic radiation of lower wavelengths, to advance extended study with regard to sonoluminescent temperatures and energy research/applications. This research has significant positive potential for our world in terms of an economical, clean energy source, and potential military, medical, and transportation applications.

DETERMINING THE ORBITAL ELEMENTS OF MINOR PLANET 23265
Caroline Julia von Wurden
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Using three observations and Gauss’s Method, I calculated the orbital elements of Minor Planet 23265. Minor Planet 23265 is 3-7 kilometers in diameter, has a visible magnitude of about 17.5, and is located in Zone II of the main asteroid belt. I have seven observations between 1/8/2009 and 2/4/2009. I obtained deep sky CCD images (down to magnitude 18) on five nights with the RAPTOR-S 16” telescope run by LANL. From the asteroid’s right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) at specific times, and after correcting with positions to nearby stars from the Digital Sky survey (DSS), I could begin to do orbit calculations with a program I wrote in MathCad. Gauss’s Method to determine the orbital elements of a celestial body depends on the gravitational force law between two bodies and Kepler’s Laws for planetary motion. Given three positions (each with RA, Dec, and time) of an asteroid, and the Sun-Earth vectors (which can be looked up), Gauss’s Method finds the distance from the asteroid to the sun and the asteroid to the earth for the three times. Then the six orbital parameters of the asteroid can be determined: Eccentricity, Perihelion Distance, Time of Perihelion, Angle of the Ascending node, Argument of Perihelion, and Inclination. The orbital elements I calculate using a least squares fit to all my data are within 1% of NASA's JPL orbital elements ephemeris.

Blake Alan Birmingham
Leesville High School, Leesville, LA

The purpose of this project is to create a device that generates, contains, and directs plasma discharges. Such a device could be used in a range of situations from ionic propulsion to energy weapons. <br><br>Plasma is created through the ionization of a gas and is composed of the remaining ions and electrons. To create the plasma, I constructed a simple Tesla coil composed of a 5 kilovolt transformer, an automotive spark gap, and two coils of different sized copper wire. <br><br>To contain the plasma I have deduced that it must be encompassed in a negatively charged electromagnetic field. Once the plasma was created and contained, I then wanted to determine if the density of the plasma affects containment of the plasma in the electric field. To perform these experiments the plasma is created through the ionization of varying amounts of certain gasses in a controlled environment. I used microwaves to increase the density by imparting energy to the gas which in turn increases the amount of ionization and reduces the amount of energy lost by ejected ions. I removed the magnetron from a microwave oven to generate the microwaves, but saw little effect on uncontained plasma. I have also performed experiments to determine the effects microwaves have on containing the plasma at different levels of density. To direct the plasma I used an electromagnetic burst from a series of coils charged by high voltage capacitors.

OPTIMIZATION OF CCD PARAMETERS FOR HIGH RESOLUTION LUNAR IMAGING
Michelle Dawn Wenz
Red Lion Area Senior High School, Red Lion, PA

Atmospheric turbulence has always made it very hard to produce good lunar images from ground based telescopes. It was hypothesized that the correct gain and exposure time settings used with a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera on a small telescope could be used to obtain high resolution images of the moon. This should be possible due to the advanced video data reduction techniques that are available today.<br><br>This investigation determined the optimal operating parameters needed to obtain high resolution images of the moon using a 5-inch telescope and an inexpensive 8-bit CCD camera. Operating the CCD camera in video mode and employing the RegiStax video processing program, 52,000 individual CCD images were analyzed. CCD images were taken of two areas, maria (flat lava plains of low contrast), and highly cratered lunar highlands (high contrast). These areas were observed using 6 different gain settings and 36 different exposure times. <br><br>The standard deviation of the pixel values in a small area in each of the two lunar regions were measured. The areas were chosen to be as featureless as possible and thus the pixel values should have a very small standard deviation. A gain setting of 700 and stacking together 500 images produced the smallest standard deviations. Using these settings resulted in the best lunar images.<br><br>By using these techniques it is possible to produce imaging results that are minimally affected by atmospheric turbulence. Further investigations could be done with better CCDs and larger telescopes to observe planets as well as the moon.

LINEAR MOMENTUM TRANSFER FROM GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
Kaylyn Gail Jackson
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

This project was an exploration into theoretical astrophysics and focused on gravitational waves, which are proposed by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity and are caused by the acceleration of massive objects in spacetime. The purpose of the project was to investigate whether a gravitational wave could transfer linear momentum to a particle, causing the particle to move in the direction in which the wave was traveling. I hypothesized that gravitational waves could transfer linear momentum to particles due to the fact that they interact with matter and carry energy and linear momentum away from their source. <br><br> <br><br>The project involved manipulation of mathematical equations based on general relativity and use of the geodesic equation. The computer program Mathematica was used in order to create equations of motion based on an acceleration 4-vector obtained from the geodesic equation for a particle moved by a gravitational wave and to create a mathematical model for the linear momentum transfer from a gravitational wave to a particle. In Mathematica, I used a system of rotating particles and generated position and velocity graphs showing the movement of one particle in the system due to a gravitational wave in the direction of the gravitational wave’s propagation. I hope to further my project by accounting for multiple gravitational waves in my model. Not much is known currently about gravitational waves and they have not yet been detected, so the results of this project will contribute to our knowledge of gravitational waves.

LIGHT BEAM COMMUNICATION
Bradley Joseph Natarian
Old Mill Senior High School, Millersville, MD

Light Beam Communication (LBC), a wireless way to move sound, using light, may revolutionize communication. For my experiment, I wanted to discover the effects of changing the type of pulse-position amplitude modulation subject to LBC. I hypothesized that a high amplitude versus low amplitude transmission sequence would yield a lower error count, lower bit error rate (BER), and greater percentage of correctly transmitted bits than a high amplitude versus no amplitude transmission sequence. To investigate this subject I designed LBC equipment and transmitted a 64 bit pseudo random bit sequence. I developed a program to determine the number of errors in data transmission. There is evidence suggesting that using a high versus low amplitude transmission sequence yields a lower error count, lower BER, and greater percentage of correctly transmitted bits than using a high versus no amplitude transmission sequence for my light beam communication equipment with <br><br>pulse-position amplitude modulation. This is because there is twice the distinction between a 1 and a 0 using a high versus low amplitude transmission sequence. Future experimentation can lead to the use of lasers, alignment devices, and error correction techniques. LBC is a relatively undiscovered form of communication that has many possibilities. This research is bringing new leaps toward relieving our dependence on radio waves for communication.

This research aims at achieving several objectives that might help us economize electricity through these mains points. First of all, utilization of the external enlightment for enlightening inside, developing the lights of cars and streets, saving the electric power and reducing costs.<br><br> Personally, I see that electricity is a very significant source of power and energy and power nowadays, thus, I was determined to invent and make something new that could contribute to save this valuable source of energy. I took my turn as part of my awareness of this project, and as a diligent I worked hard to collect information about electricity and different tools. The idea of my project can be summarized in the principle of working for my project which is as this: the principle of working of this circuit starts when the sensor receives the light coming into a place, the much the amount of light entering the higher the current of the sensor be. As a result, the current of the circuit will be lesser, thus the lightning of the lamp will be also lesser and visa versa, the lesser the amount of light entering, the higher the current of the circuit, thus the light of the lamp will be stronger. For more explanation, a place that needs a lighting of 100 watts in order to be fully lighted. If the amount of light coming which is about 50 watts of external light, thus the lamp will produce lighting of about 50 watts, so the amount of light coming changes into 70 watts, so the lamp might produce lighting of about 30 watts, and so on throughout day, the larger the light entering the lesser of the lamp lighting will be. all this depends on the amount of light that the sensor receives.<br><br> My project needed some tools like, a source of electric exertion, a lamp, a transistors, dilators, fuse, commutator, and diodes.<br><br> The outcomes of my project are that we could control the lighting of the lamp by using the external lighting through the internal lighting. So this could save energy and reduce costs.

UNCOVERING ELUSIVE ULTRA HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES: DEVELOPMENT OF A METHOD FOR COSMIC RAY DETECTION
Glen Andrew Meyerowitz
Northport High School, Northport, NY

The objective of this study was to determine whether or not radar can be used to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The present study used radar detectors and scintillators set up by the MARIACHI Project. MARIACHI is made up of 5 scintillator sites located at high schools across Suffolk County, Long Island and 2 radar stations that are located at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Custer Institute. The scintillators are activated whenever a cosmic ray shower occurs in their vicinity. These arrays provide a time and place of a cosmic ray air shower. As the scintillators are recording their signal, the ionized particles created by the shower are reflecting radio waves back to earth, some of which hit the receiver. Because the radar uses a dipole antenna, the reflected signal then can be traced back to the particular high school over which the shower occurred.<br><br>A number of coincident radar and scintillator peaks were found. This was accomplished by using a variety of novel computer programs. Evidence that these radar peaks were caused by cosmic rays is based on three criteria: first they displayed an increase in specific frequencies that are shown to correspond to short duration signals, such as cosmic rays, second they occurred at the specified scintillator time, and finally, their angle of detection was in close agreement with the known angle between the scintillator site and the radar detector. The further development of this method will provide a breakthrough in the detection of these elusive and fundamentally important particles.

A MICROWAVE METAMATERIAL LENS WITH NEGATIVE INDEX OF REFRACTION
Rahul Kumar Pandey
Stoney Creek High School, Rochester Hills, MI

Materials generally have a positive index of refraction. This project is on a lens made of artificial materials (also called metamaterials) with a negative index of refraction. A novel and powerful characterization of negative index materials is provided. This report describes both theory and experiment for a three dimensional lens with negative index n. Modeling of the image formation by a lens with n = -1 shows that the width of the lens equals the sum of the object and image distances. Based on modeling results, a lens consisting of a lattice of split-rings and wires is built and tested. The metal rings and wires interact with microwaves at 11.25 GHz to generate simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity needed for negative index of refraction. Studies on microwave transmission and image formation for the lens show a gain of ~8 dB and good agreement with theory. This data was collected with the use of a vector network analyzer. Field maps of the focusing of exiting microwaves from varying source distances are presented. Negative index materials show unique properties such as reversed Snell’s Law. Interest in negative-index metamaterials is growing tremendously due to their exotic properties and potential to improve microwave signal processing devices.

REMOTE DETERMINATION OF VELOCITY FROM OPTICAL DOPPLER SHIFTS OF SPECTRAL LINES
Molly Rose Grossman
Sherwood High School, Sandy Spring, MD

A method for measurement of ocean wave velocities using Doppler shifts of Fraunhofer lines present in the solar spectrum was validated using computational modeling and tested through experimentation. This method would allow for remote measurement of ocean currents or monitoring for tsunami using satellites. Light emitted or reflected by a moving object will have its frequency Doppler shifted by an amount related to the velocity of the object. However, ocean waves travel slowly compared to light and produce a very small Doppler shift. To detect small velocities across large areas, this method uses the equation of the relativistic Doppler shift and standard-velocity filter spectra to evaluate the effect across the entire recorded spectrum. Through simulation in MATLAB, it was shown that realistic ocean wave velocities of approximately 10 m/s can be measured with precision to 1 m/s if sufficient spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are achieved. An experiment was designed and implemented using a fluorescent lamp to simulate the sun, a rotating mirror to simulate ocean waves, and a spectroradiometer as detector. Data was collected at velocities from 0 to 12.5 m/s and was processed using the algorithm developed in the aforementioned simulation. Results from data processing showed that higher granularity than was possible with the available spectroradiometer (5.0 Å) is necessary to detect the shift, although visible differences between spectra were noted.

This project involves the development of a method to analyse the sound environment of any given classroom with the objective of determining acoustically optimum seating positions. Utilizing the meteorological concept of isobars, areas of equal sound intensity or decibels were joined by "isobels" producing a series of isobel contour maps that provide teachers with visual feedback of the sound dynamics for their particular classroom.<br><br>Decibel measurements were recorded using an mp3 player inserted in a dummy's head, simulating human hearing. The sound source was a multi-layered computer-generated wave, compiled from analysis of the fundamental and harmonic frequencies of each classroom teacher's voice. Stereo sound levels were recorded at 50 evenly-spaced locations resulting in 16 differential and topographical isobel contour maps being generated for each of the 11 classrooms tested.<br><br>Several trends and patterns in the acoustic profile of classrooms were observed. The ceiling architecture was found to have a major acoustic influence with the presence of dead spots beyond structural roof beams. Proximity to drapes, open doors, windows and tall cupboards reduced local sound intensities. An observation was also made that differing voice frequencies of individual teachers affect the sound dynamics of a room.<br><br>The application of this project has been to identify the acoustically optimum seating positions for the integrated hearing impaired students enrolled in my school. As a result, teachers have repositioned students with favourable feedback. Finally, with the advent of a new school year, extra classrooms have been mapped to cater for additional hearing impaired students.

MEASUREMENT OF LUNAR REFLECTIVITY FOR VERIFICATION OF A LAMBERTIAN MODEL
Nathaniel Bryant Pfeifer
Alpha Omega Academy, Los Lunas, NM

First, a simple radiometer was constructed using several low-bias current operational amplifiers, a solar cell, and a volt-meter to measure the amount of light being reflected by the moon. The instrument was then calibrated using the solar constant of the sun (~1000 W/m2). Readings of the moon were taken daily for several cycles of the moon. Then the data was plotted. Finally, the data was compared to theory that says, if the moon was Lambertian, the amount of light reflected by the full moon should be pi-times the amount at the quarter moon. However, the reflected light at the full moon is about ten times the amount at the quarter moon implying that the moon is not Lambertian but is more like the material in a street sign. Literature indicates that this non-Lambertian behavior may be caused by glassy beads left on the surface of the moon by asteroids called the regolith. The ratio of the solar constant to the “lunar constant” at the full moon was also calculated.

STABILITY OF GOLD-THIOLATE NANOPARTICLE VAPOR SENSORS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES
Katherine Yuan Fang
Pioneer High School, Ann Arbor, MI

The ability to detect explosives is essential to protecting our country from terrorists. Currently, researchers are developing a micro gas chromatography system that separates and electronically identifies chemical components of a sample. Gold-thiolate nanoparticle vapor sensors, which are being tested as explosive detectors, may be used in the system. However, explosive particles are heavy and nonvolatile, so they have difficulty moving through the column. Operating the system at elevated temperatures overcomes this problem, but it may also damage the heat-sensitive sensors. The purpose of my experiment was to determine the maximum temperature that the gold-thiolate nanoparticle vapor sensors can operate at. Also, I hypothesized that crosslinking the nanoparticles reduces the sensors’ sensitivity to heat.<br><br>Six gold-thiolate nanoparticles vapor sensors were constructed. They were grouped based on nanoparticle type: 4-mercapto-diphenyl-acetylene (DPA), 1-octanethiol (C8), and 1-mercapto-6-phenoxyhexane (OPH). Each type had one crosslinked and one un-crosslinked sensor. A device was engineered to measure the sensors’ resistances. Resistance measurements were taken every 60 seconds for three days at 22ºC, 50ºC, 75ºC, 90ºC, 105ºC, and 125ºC. Labview and Origin software were used to calculate each sensor’s normalized change in resistance, a standard measure of stability.<br><br>The results indicate that the maximum temperature gold-thiolate nanoparticle vapor sensors can operate effectively at is 105ºC. Over 105ºC, all sensors malfunctioned (the normalized change in resistance >20%). Overall, crosslinking significantly decreased the impact of elevated temperatures on the sensors (p=0.0059). These findings are critical to the development of a micro gas chromatography system that can successfully detect explosives.

LIGHT MODULATION FOR OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS - CAN SOUND HITCH A RIDE ON A LIGHT WAVE?
Alexandru Rablau
Grand Blanc High School, Grand Blanc, MI

This project is a study of the interaction between visible light and ultrasonic waves in a dense flint glass via the acousto-optic effect. The practical goal of the project was to assemble a system that uses this interaction to achieve amplitude modulation of a red Helium-Neon laser beam and transmit a song from a CD player to a speaker through free space. This, in turn, has required a detailed study and characterization of the acousto-optic modulator employed.<br><br> A parallel-plate dense flint glass acousto-optic modulator driven by an RF signal with a central frequency of 80 MHz was employed. The first order of diffraction produced by the sound-induced grating could be observed experimentally at an angle of 0.73 degrees. This is within 11% of the theoretically calculated value of 0.80 degrees, based on a known value of the speed of ultrasound in dense flint glass of 3630 m/s. Furthermore, a linear dependence was found between the diffraction angle (in radians) and the frequency of the RF signal, as predicted by diffraction theory. An experimental value of 2.0E-10 radians/Hz is found for the slope, in reasonable agreement with the theoretically calculated value of 1.74E-10 radians/Hz.<br><br> The intensity of the first order diffracted beam varied linearly with the amplitude of the driving RF signal, allowing undistorted modulation of the laser beam. The modulated beam was then detected by a photodiode set to receive the diffracted beam, and the recovered modulated signal was amplified and played back in a set of speakers, demonstrating the transmission of sound over a laser beam through free space.

FAST LOW-COST BISPHENOL-A (BPA) DETECTOR
Harikrishna Rallapalli
Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton, CA

BPA is widely used to make clear, hard polycarbonate reusable water bottles and baby bottles. BPA based epoxy resins are used for lining the insides of food and beverage cans. BPA mimics hormones like estrogen and alters human cells physiologically. It is present in human urine and is increasingly being associated with serious long-term health impacts even at very low concentrations (e.g. 0.0001 micrograms of BPA/kg of body weight/day vs. the US EPA limit of 50 micrograms/Kg body weight/day).<br><br>Gas Chromatography/Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with optional Fluorescence detection is a standard BPA detection technique. GC/MS is sensitive (0.01 micrograms/Liter), but time consuming, complex and costly for consumers. Ultraviolet absorption and Ultraviolet Fluorescence spectroscopy are both very sensitive (e.g. 0.6 nanograms/mL for Fluorescence) and fast. However, commercial detection products and processes using these and other detection techniques are all prohibitively expensive and complex for consumers.<br><br>The goal of this project is to develop a fast, low-cost, user-friendly BPA detector that will enable consumers to easily detect minute quantities of BPA leaching from plastic containers/cans into their contents, under typical use conditions.<br><br>The detector uses low cost UV sources, optical filters, cuvettes (or drops) to hold the sample and a special-purpose spectrometer based on programmable micro-controller and optoelectronics. It is calibrated using relative fluorescence units for blank, sample and negative/positive controls to assess BPA concentration. Ultraviolet fluorescence (and absorption) of BPA has been measured using a variety of instruments, samples (bottled water, infant fruit juices, canned chickpeas), containers (plastic bottles, bags, cans) and temperatures (room, heated) to validate the major design components. It enables consumers to easily and rapidly detect BPA leaching into the contents of polycarbonate bottles and food cans. Improvements to reduce costs and false positive rates and improve usability, sensitivity, robustness and signal to noise ratio are ongoing.

A RELATIVISTIC GENERALIZATION OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS TO QUARK-GLUON PLASMAS
Nilesh Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, CA

Quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the super-hot matter created after the Big Bang, has recently been shown in experiments to behave like a near-ideal liquid instead of like a rarified plasma as previously theoretically predicted. Here we study the hydrodynamic expansion of QGP by deriving a geometrically simple, causal, and relativistic formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a simple QGP equation of state in order to study the effects of viscosity and other transport coefficients on QGP's dynamic evolution. Similarly, we also make some interesting predictions regarding bulk viscosity's effects on QGP's dynamics which may have implications for some puzzling experimental data regarding hydrodynamic "freeze-out" and also perhaps for cosmological expansion. Specifically we suggest cavitation, a violent bubbling, may be the mechanism by which QGP transitions into hadrons. We also find that QGP's dynamic expansion is highly sensitive to variations in viscosity but not to variations in other transport coefficients. This super-sensitivity may help support an accurate computation of the shear viscosity which may in turn be used study and test certain quantum theories and string theories experimentally.

LIGHT CURVE ANALYSIS OF ECLIPSING BINARY STAR SYSTEM Y GRU
Erik Nicholas Littleton
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

In this study we gathered photometric CCD data on the detached eclipsing binary system Y Gru, using 16 inch robotic telescopes in Cerro Tolo Chile. We generated a light curve using aperture photometry measurements and then analyzed the light curve using a variation on the Nelson-Davis-Etzel model. We determined the relative radii of the stars, inclination of the orbit, and surface brightness ratio of the components with a reasonable uncertainty. To determine the absolute parameters of the system or to study more subtle effects such as limb darkening, spectroscopic radial velocities and more accurate photometry would have to be obtained.

IDENTIFYING T TAURI STARS USING SMALL-SCALE OPTICAL TELESCOPES
Jennifer Lynn Butchart
Oil City Area Senior High School, Oil City, PA

Identifying T Tauri stars can be a challenging process. It typically requires expensive and sophisticated equipment and data analysis techniques. This study used optical data from Kitt Peak National Observatory’s WIYN 0.9-meter telescope and R, IR, H-alpha filters to image known T Tauri stars and standard stars. Simple intensity values were measured using MaxIm DL and plotted on an X/Y scatter plot with Log(I-intensity/R-intensity) vs. Log(Halpha-intensity/R-intensity). There is strong evidence that this simplified data analysis technique termed SBOSM (Spuck-Butchart Optical Survey Method) could be used to identify and classify T-Tauri candidates.

CD PHOTO-SPECTROSCOPY: CONSTRUCTION OF A SPECTROSCOPE USING A COMPACT DISK, A DIGITAL CAMERA AND PYTHON IMAGE PROCESSING.
Sayuri Sepulveda
Laval Liberty High School, Laval, Quebec, CANADA

By using simple household items such as a CD, cardboard and a camera we describe how to build a reasonable low-res spectroscope, still capable of quantitative measurements. We believe this project is a great pedagogical tool towards introducing quantum physical principles at a high-school level.<br><br> <br><br>The key element to make this device work is the usage of the Python Image Library (PIL). Having such a capable set of image processing functions, one can write a script that in conjunction with a proper optical design, allows us to: (a) integrate the spectral decomposition of our subject, and (b) calibrate and resolve the wavelengths of the observed features. Two laser pointers with frequencies 520 nm and 650 nm serve as our standards to calibrate the device.<br><br>Once calibrated, we turn our focus to Astrophysics (Sun spectra, possibly detecting a number of Fraunhoffer lines), Physical Chemistry (measuring flame emission spectra of a number of metallic salts) and to basic Quantum Physics (looking at the spectra of halogen gases, LCDs and CRTs). Ultimately we attempt to exploit the properties of blackbody radiation to address the question of whether our device can be used to estimate the temperature of our sun and distant stars.<br><br>Although attaining quantitative measurements and exploring the quantum physics of light is one highlight of this experiment, the most interesting result is that we developed a simple, elegant and surprisingly accurate device that can be used in the teaching of basic physics curriculum to develop student’s intuition and experimental ingenuity.

FOOD PRESERVATION BY MAGNETIC FIELDS
Samantha Melendez
Ines Maria Mendoza de Munoz Marin High School, Cabo Rojo, PUERTO RICO

Nowadays, there are various methods of food preservation. Refrigeration is the one most commonly used. Refrigerators use chemicals that are toxic and dangerous to our health and to the environment. The process of food decomposition starts by the union of dipolar enzymes once plants evolve to their full bloom. Therefore, if you interrupt the enzymes process you can delay food decomposition process. This study intends to create a new method to preserve food. The problem studied was: will electromagnetism delay food decomposition?. The hypothesis was that the exposition of food to electromagnetic fields will help to preserve them. To test the hypothesis an experimental group consisting of three solenoids was prepared. Solenoid A had a coil made of 71m of copper wire, solenoid B had 100 m of copper wire and solenoid C had 150m of copper wire. Ten Vitis Vinifera (green grapes) were placed inside the tube centered to the coil in each of the solenoids. The control group consisted of one tube with ten green grapes inside it. Each of the three solenoids in the experimental group was connected to a power supply. All green grapes developed fungus after three days. But after five days it started to disappear in the grapes inside the electromagnetic field. These grapes were preserved for an average of nine days while the ones in the control group were rotten. Results lead to conclude that fruits exposed to electromagnetism fields, in the range of 3.7 x 10 -3 T to 7.9 x 10 -3 T, were preserved.

“VERSATILE WIND VELOCITY AND DIRECTION TRANSDUCER”
Olexandr Olenyev
Bahatoprofilnyj Litsey #99, Zaporizhzhya, UKRAINE

Due to constantly changing wind direction and velocity, the operation of the windmill generators is often sub optimal, therefore the development of low cost combined, reliable and accurate wind force and direction sensor as a controller for the windmill direction is an important global issue for energy conservation. <br><br>The problems, such as lack of precision, slow reaction time, inability to work in broad temperature ranges, complexity and fragility of the devices associated with many design patterns of anemometers were identified and a novel design was suggested. The new apparatus consists of very few moving parts, has lowered reaction to the wind flaws, output signal can be readily digitized in real time, simultaneous measurement of wind force and direction is achieved, apparatus is not influenced by temperature, pressure, humidity or air density, has small dimensions and low cost. The working principle of the apparatus is based on the spring suspended light source and a photocell array below. Light source is connected with the aerodynamic sail via a spindle shaft assembly fixed to the sensor with a flexible elastic rubber gasket. The photocells detect the light position on the array from the source tilted by the wind and induce signal that is detected and digitized. Tilt angles are calibrated with known wind speeds and included in the software prior to operation. <br><br>The suggested system can be implemented in flow measurement of any type including winds or tides making windmills more efficient and navigation safer.

MAKING MYSTERIOUS MOLECULAR MISFITS - FINDING KF4- AND SUPER ANIONS
Michael Thomas Lemanski
Royal St. George's College, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA

Research into super anions and related anions is still in its early. Super anions have been known as rugged, stable anions for some time. Related tetra-fluoride anions have never been seen before but are of great interest and may have practical applications. 137La, a rare radioactive isobar of 137Ba, and the super anion LaF4- may be used as indicators in exposure dating. Unfortunately BaF4- has an identical mass to LaF4 and therefore can act as a contaminant during dating. Greater understanding of tetra-fluoride anions such as KF4- and CaF4- could yield a way of eliminating BaF4- contaminants. The first step in this endeavor is the confirming the existence of these tetra-fluorides. Theory has neither confirmed nor rejected their presence. This project searched for KF4- and CaF4- using Accelerated Mass Spectrometry. In this process two reactants in an ion source are bombarded by a Cesium beam. The newly created ions travel through a spectrometer magnet that only allows ions of a certain mass through a focusing slit. The ionic compounds then pass through an accelerator where they are broken into their respective components and stripped of their electrons before going through another spectrometer magnet. This magnet only lets F+ ions enter an atom counter in groups no larger than the number of F- ions in the compound searched for. A computer records the atom counter’s results. Using this method the existence of CaF4 was confirmed however, KF4- was not found. More research is needed on the formation of tetra-fluoride anions.

A STUDY OF QUIESCENT FLICKER BEHAVIOR IN A DWARF NOVA
Nicole DyAnn Melso
Springfield High School, Springfield, PA

Dwarf Nova Abstract<br><br> The purpose of this project was to identify and discover possible precursors to variable star outbursts. A variable star, or a dwarf nova, is a binary star system consisting of a white dwarf that accretes matter from its companion star. Variable stars irregularly go into outbursts in which they drastically increase in brightness, and then drop back down into a quiet or quiescent state. Quiescence is the dormant stage of a dwarf nova; however during quiescence, dwarf nova can flicker or vary slightly in magnitude. <br><br> For this project I chose to study SS Cygni a well known dwarf nova. I collected data in the form of photometry images. A photometry image measures the brightness of an object in space. I received these images using a Global Rent-A-Scope telescope that I controlled over the internet. I was able to obtain four sets of data with 50-100 photometry images per each set. I analyzed these images using the programs Photometrica and Peranso by looking for differences in the data closer to the outburst. <br><br> I hypothesized that if I monitored SS Cygni throughout the quiescent period, then as SS Cygni approached an outburst, there would be a significant change in its flicker behavior in both the time and frequency domains. After my analysis my hypothesis was proven correct. Before outburst there was both a large increase in magnitude and the frequency of my data. My results led me to believe that these indicators could be signs that an outburst is about to begin.

THE EFFECT OF CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT VS. LINEARLY POLARIZED LIGHT ON THE FLUORESCENCE OF QUANTUM DOTS BURIED AT VARIOUS DEPTHS IN A POLYMER MATRIX
Kevin Chen
Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, New York, NY

A method that may enhance biomedical imaging applications, such as the imaging of nanoparticles or fluorescent bacteria in skin cells, would be to use circularly polarized light to excite the fluorescent species. In this research, the excitation efficiency of linearly polarized light vs. circularly polarized light in exciting CdSe/ZnS (in toluene) quantum dots buried in highly scattering media were studied. The experiment compared the amount of energy emitted by quantum dots buried at different depths after being excited by linearly and circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized light was obtained by placing a quarter waveplate in the path of the pumping beam. After excitation, the fluorescent signal emitted by the quantum dots was collected using a telescopic arrangement of lenses and apertures. A power meter and spectrometer were used to measure the fluorescent signal in a media composed of several parafilm layers with buried quantum dots, and another that included polystyrene. Results of this study show that circularly polarized light always produced higher fluorescence emission than linearly polarized light. Circularly polarized light consistently showed a higher efficiency in exciting quantum dots buried in greater depths, and different media. This proves that circularly polarized light will scatter less than linearly polarized light in turbid media such as parafilm, polystyrene, and human tissue. Future studies would include a test for the limitations of circularly polarized light in exciting nanoparticles in high scattering media.

THE STUDY OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL RANDOM CLOSE PACKING OF SPHERES
Hamaad Hassan
Sheepshead Bay High School, Brooklyn, NY

Granular materials can be found in the shape of spheres. Particle packing has been recognized as an issue for many years. When spheres are packed they leave spaces which cause their original mathematical volume to differ from their packed volume. Granular materials are in the shape of spheres like sand, ball bearings, pharmaceuticals, flour, coal, and fertilizers. The first objective of the study is to fix the packing problem of the spheres and to determine how spheres and particles can be packed as densely as possible. On a micro level, spheres can be packed one by one in a specific arrangement, but this is difficult on a macro level. The second objective of the study is to observe packed material in three dimensions. This research can be applied in many engineering and medical fields. In engineering, coding theory involves spheres packing problem. In the bio-medical field, this research applies in the bio-disk, packing of cells and pharmaceuticals. In order to pack spheres more densely, three methods were used: liquid packing, dry packing and dry liquid packing. To calculate the coordination number and void fraction, refractive index matching was used. The results of this study show that the densest packing obtained was by using the dry liquid packing method. In hexagonal close packing, the coordination number is twelve and in random close packing, coordination number eight was obtained. Spheres were observed in three dimensions and the methods used in this study indicate a potentially good technique of packing particles.

ALL-SOLID-STATE ULTRAVIOLET LASER FOR LASIK SURGERY
Tanvir Jahan
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

LASIK eye surgery for correcting vision is currently done using Excimer lasers, which suffer from many drawbacks that arise due to the utilization of gases. These drawbacks include cumbersome bulkiness, noisiness, instability of optical pulses, and high annual maintenance costs. In addition, the Excimer lasers use fluoride gas, which is toxic and may be potentially harmful to the environment. The basis of this research is to design and build a new solid-state laser that can create an ultraviolet laser beam for LASIK surgery without the use of gases. In the setup, a 532 nm pump laser was used to power a Titanium-doped-sapphire laser cavity. The subsequent laser beam was sent through two second harmonic generation stages using nonlinear frequency-doubling crystals. The crystals, which were lithium triborate and barium borate respectively, each bisected the wavelength of the beam to ultimately produce a 210 nanometer ultraviolet beam. The efficiency of the system was determined by measuring the power conversion rates of each of the three stages. The ultraviolet beam showed to be powerful and precise enough to ablate very smooth structures onto the surface of glass. Therefore, the laser could be used for LASIK with many improvements over the Excimer laser.

A TIME-DEPENDENT IMPACT PARAMETER MODEL SHEDS LIGHT ON THE EVOLUTION OF GALAXY MORPHOLOGY IN COMPACT CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES.
Keith Austin Hawkins
GlenOak, Canton, OH

Current models in galaxy cluster evolution predict that compact galaxy clusters evolve in a random way. These current models are used to understand the Butcher-Oemler effect (BO effect). However, recent studies done by Hawkins and Cederbloom, in preparation, are now suggesting the impact parameter may actually be time dependent. The new model, called the time-dependent impact parameter model, states the probability of a low-impact parameter collision decreases as a<br><br>cluster evolves. The impact parameter has been determined to be inversely proportional to the production of hot gas halos responsible for active star formation. Therefore, the time-dependent impact parameter model predicts the probability of active star formation, and therefore spiral fraction, should decrease as a cluster evolves, effectively modifying the BO effect. This prediction was tested by observing the spiral fraction as well as the fraction of other morphological types in 23 Hickson Compact Groups of galaxies totaling 99 galaxies. Data sets were complied from the Hickson Compact Group Catalogue. Results show the average spiral fraction, which contains intermediate to high active star formation rates, is inversely proportional to the dynamical age with<br><br>a very high(r=0.99) and significant (p<0.05) correlation. This relationship is consentient with the time dependent impact parameter model of galaxy collisions. The results of this investigation support the time-dependent impact parameter model and point at two novel concepts in astronomy: The BO effect must be modified on the level of compact clusters to understand their evolution and there is a possible evolution among morphological galaxy types.

A PHOTOMETRIC STUDY OF ECLIPSING BINARY STARS: A METHODOLOGY FOR CLASSIFICATION
Peter Kelly Blanchard
La Jolla Country Day School, La Jolla, CA

This project was a study of two W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binary star systems, AB Andromedae and ER Orionis. The study sought to describe the stars based on various classification schemes and to verify classifications found in the literature. Operating a telescope in New Mexico, observations of these two systems were made and measured by photometry software. Lightcurves were created from these observations and modeling software was used to fit models to the observational data. From these models, certain parameters of the binary star systems were determined and compared with those found by other research. It was found that inferences made from observations by the author were mostly in agreement with known parameters and classifications. AB Andromedae and ER Orionis are systems where the stars are in contact and therefore fill or even overflow their Roche lobes. The spectral classes for these stars range from G to F, which are stars with temperatures ranging from about 5000 to 7500 Kelvin. It was verified that AB Andromedae and ER Orionis are W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binary star systems. This project was successful in understanding the morphologies of these two systems and the researcher will continue to gather data for other stars. Binary star research will give scientists a greater understanding of how stars interact with each other and ultimately how they evolve.

WASP 2-B OR NOT JUST 2-B: DOES WASP 2 HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLANET?
Travis Le
Punahou School, Honolulu, HI

The search for extra-solar planets started in 1988 when the first extra-solar planet was detected. Recently though, there has been an increase in interest in this subject. The initial idea of this project was to verify that the star, WASP 2, has only one planet. If there were more than one planet orbiting WASP 2, the presence of another celestial body could affect the midpoint time of transit. After comparing the midpoint times for several transits, this led to a surprising discovery.<br><br><br> It is hypothesized that if WASP 2 has only one planet, then the midpoint times of each transit, should lie on the ephemeris of midpoints. The midpoint time of transit was determined through a series of images taken from remote telescopes. Performing photometry on the images using MIRA, measured the fluxes of several stars. By comparing these fluxes and computing a relative flux for WASP 2, the data was graphed and analyzed.<br><br><br> WASP 2 was observed on five nights during a six month period. An example is the transit of 7/15. In JD, the theoretical midpoint time was 2454663.006, but the experimental midpoint time was 2454662.997 with a margin of error of ±0.0007. The experimental midpoint time for this transit did not cross the ephemeris of midpoints at all. Although my hypothesis was refuted, my project is a huge contribution to astronomy. The results show that WASP 2 doesn't have just one planet, and this may eventually lead to the discovery of another extra-solar planet.

SUBCRITICAL NEUTRON MULTIPLICATION IN A 2.5 MEV NEUTRON FLUX
Taylor Ramon Wilson
The Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

A research project was undertaken to explore the concept of subcritical neutron multiplication of a small fusion neutron source. A device commonly referred to as a “Fusor” makes a promising neutron source for industry, medicine, and research because it is safer and less of a liability from a regulatory standpoint. However, the Fusor emits too few neutrons for some applications. The goal of this research was to see if the application of sub-critical neutron multiplication could increase the neutron flux from a Fusor. The process involved taking fissionable isotopes of heavy elements and using the neutrons from the fusion reaction to fission the atoms, thus making more neutrons. The experiments carried out involved the use of different amounts of Thorium, Natural Uranium, and Depleted Uranium compounds and metals. Current data shows that the effect is taking place, both in a moderated and unmoderated neutron flux and is increasing the flux at the detector by over double the control. The multiplication effect increased as potentials increased and research is being conducted at higher voltages. Pulsing the Fusor with capacitors is also currently underway, and with the much higher fluxes, a greater multiplication effect is taking place. This data may have homeland security applications in the detection of proliferated nuclear material. Along with showing that the effect can possibly be used to bring the Fusor up to par with fluxes from other commercial devices, the research suggests that a Fusor in a pulsed mode can detect highly enriched uranium, possibly plutonium, from a nuclear device, even inside a metal cargo container.

STAR IN A JAR: OPERATING PARAMETER RELATIONSHIPS IN AN INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTOR
Eric A. Foss
Kentwood High School, Covington, WA

In a fusion reaction, two light atomic nuclei fuse together and release a large amount of energy. With an unlimited supply of deuterium fuel available from the oceans, fusion could supply the world’s future energy needs in a clean, sustainable way. Most current fusion research efforts are directed towards magnetic and inertial confinement, but a lesser known method called inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) accelerates deuterium plasma to a temperature of 180 million degrees C using only a strong electric field in a vacuum chamber. I designed and built a tabletop IEC fusion reactor using commonly available materials. I built an electrolysis system to supply deuterium gas from heavy water. To study the important operating parameter relationships, I programmed a LabView data acquisition system to measure electric field voltage, current, reactor chamber pressure, and temperature. For visualization, I wrote a MATLAB script to plot the three dimensional operating surface. I found that the control difficulties reported with this type of reactor are due to operation in the asymptotic region of the operational curve. I found that the classical Paschen model and a more recently proposed empirical model of the voltage-pressure relationship did not match parts of my data. I built an empirical model of the relationship with a sixth order Laurent polynomial. Multivariate linear regression worked better than downhill simplex for estimating the coefficients. My final three dimensional model fits my measured three dimensional data with a correlation coefficient of 0.88.

THE MOTION OF WRIGHTIA RELIGIOSA BENTH. SEEDS
Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun
Hatyaiwitthayalai School, Hatyai, Songkhla, THAILAND

Studies on the motion of Wrightia religiosa Benth. seeds were carried out. The seeds were explored and segregated by length of hair at the end of the seeds into 3 types: A, B and C. All types of seeds, weighing 5 mg, were experimented both in with and without wind flow conditions and showed that the forms of hair at the end of the seeds significantly affected the motion of the seed. Firstly, experiment was performed under a condition without wind flow in a wind controller box and a model was created. At the initial point when the seeds were released, the initial speed ( ) was equal to zero. As the speed increased through time, acceleration of the seeds reached zero at a point where terminal velocity ( ) was reached and the seeds travel at constant velocity. After the proposed model was tested, assuming the seeds as a rigid body), it was able to predict with 95% confident level that the terminal velocity was highest in type A seeds, followed by types B and C respectively. The motion of Wrightia religiosa Benth. seeds were also studied in the condition with wind flow by releasing the seeds vertically in a low-speed wind tunnel. The seeds motion was found to have the same pattern as under condition without wind flow while When the seeds were released horizontally,they travelled at constant velocity. Furthermore, the model was able to predict at 95% confident level that type C seeds travelled at longest distance followed by types B and A at the same wind speed.

Question: How do you visualize particle and field interactions?<br><br><br>Introduction: This study tries to unite the established concepts of Quantum Physics with the less abstract (or more, depending on your sub-field) fluid mechanics in order to show the similar mathematical models that describe nature. The experiment in question studies the motion of bubbles and the effects of internal and external forces that disrupt the paths of the bubbles. Our objective is to observe, analyze, and find mathematical relationships that describes the motion of the bubble, both in the expulsion of the bubbles in the x-axis and the rise of the bubble in the y-axis.<br><br><br>Procedures: In my experiment, I built and filled an aquarium with liquid water into which I injected a controlled volume of water through a hole. Using a video camera, I recorded the paths of the bubbles and using the program, “Graphical Analysis,” I plotted several dimensions of the particle versus time. <br><br><br>Data: From my data, I was able to conclude that the bubbles lose distance as it continues through its path, decelerating proportionally to its velocity. I found that this result stems from the effects of viscosity and buoyancy.<br><br><br>Conclusion: After observing and analyzing a plethora of data, I was able to conclude that the dominant forces in the fluid system are viscosity and buoyancy. Observing the motion of the fluid particle, I was able to relate it to ideas in Quantum Physics, showing the similarities in the structure and process of the different systems.

THE VEGETABLE WATCH
Karen Anali Garcia
Colegio de Bachilleres del Estado de Sinaloa, Guamuchil, Sinaloa, MEXICO

The project is based on the firs thermodynamics principle: the energy conservation law (the energy can not be created or destroyed in none thermodynamic system). It consists in how to obtain the energy contained in the potatoes later to canalize it towards a digital watch and to make to turn on the same without the use of batteries; consequently it is tried to create a biodegradable battery that contributes to the diminution the pollution by batteries. To build the vegetable watch were necessary: Copper and Zinc sheets, a digital watch, wires cayman type and a potato. The results were satisfactory since it was able to make work the digital watch for 11,003 minutes, using like energy source one potato of 130 grams and Zinc and Copper electrodes.<br><br>For the elaboration the experiment, potatoes were obtained in a supermarket, once washed a cross section was realised so that the tubercle was divided in 2 pieces. Later were realised 2 smaller cuts (1 cm approx) of cross-sectional form and taking care of to have a distance of 3 cm between both cuts. A sheet of Copper of 2x0, 5cm, was inserted in one of the cuts of each piece of the tubercle, and a Zinc sheet of equal measured in the remaining cuts, all the sheets were inserted to a depth of 1.5cm. Wires type cayman of 50cm of length were connected to a digital watch, and later it was continued to join the wire in contact with the positive pole of the watch with a Copper sheet, and the wire in contact with the negative pole to a Zinc sheet, but of the other half of the potato; finally the remaining sheet were joined (Copper and Zinc) to each other, using another wire cayman type of 50 cm in length, and the duration time in minutes with a chronometer was evaluated. To study the capacity of electrical conductivity of some components of the potato, we used the salts: NaCl, KCl and CaCl.

THE EFFECTS OF INPUT VOLTAGE AND CAPACITANCE ON THE MUZZLE VELOCITY OF GAUSS GUNS
Thomas Carter Foulds
John Handly High School, Winchester, VA

The purpose of the study is to continue a previous hobby exploration into the effects of input terms on the efficiency of a coil gun system. A previous set of experiments showed that input voltage had an effect upon muzzle velocity when capacitance is constant. With this new test unit, the effect of varying input capacitances is tested and compared to those of input voltage change. The expected result is increased capacitance will increase muzzle velocity along a linear path and that voltage will effect on muzzle velocity independent from capacitance. To provide better terms for comparison a similar set of voltages are used in this battery of tests. These tests showed that capacitance does have an effect on muzzle velocity which follows an arc with a discernible optimum capacitance shown by a peak in the graph. They also showed that capacitance does have an effect on the increases from voltage, actually slowing projectiles at high voltages and high capacitance.

SIMULATION OF A SPIN-STABILIZED MAGNETIC TOP IN A MAGNETIC GRADIENT TRAP
Benjamin Lee Nosarzewski
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Magnetic gradient traps are currently used for the trapping of particles with a quantum magnetic moment. The Levitron® is a magnetic top which levitates above a magnetic base (created, for this project, by using NdFeB magnets); it is a macroscopic version of a magnetic gradient trap. The top is stabilized by its rotation which constantly aligns it to the local magnetic field direction. The goal of this research was to gain a better understanding of the Levitron® by theoretically simulating the top’s motion. Numerical integration was used to simulate the top’s motion in three dimensions. The simulation qualitatively describes several facets of the observed behavior of the top. Further work, including more precise experimental measurements of the top’s motion, will be required to achieve quantitative agreement.

ROCKET SCIENCE PART 2: PREDICTING ALTITUDE FLIGHT PATHS
Sean Thomas Abrahamson
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, NM

The purpose of this experiment was to use mathematics and physics to try to predict the altitude of a model rocket at every tenth of a second during its flight. The hypothesis was that the average percent difference between the mathematically predicted height values and the height values given by an altimeter placed in the rocket would be less than 10 percent. <br><br>Research shows that it is necessary to take into account a rocket’s drag coefficient and its mass lost during flight to accurately predict its height. A wind tunnel was constructed to find the drag coefficient of the rocket. To predict the rocket height, a complex program that included the drag coefficient and a formula for the mass lost during the thrusting phase was run in a spreadsheet. A special rocket altimeter was purchased and fitted into the rocket’s payload compartment. There was a total of seven rocket launches used in this project and the height values given by the altimeter were compared to the height values given by the computer program. <br><br>The average percent difference for Trials 1,2,4,5 and 6 were all less than 10 percent, but only in Trials 2,4, and 6 was the hypothesis supported statistically. This is because of the very large percent differences that occurred in the first five time intervals. If the first five time intervals were not taken into account, all but the seventh trial would have statistically supported the hypothesis.

CAN YOU DO THE WATER WALK?
Nikita Michael Bogdanov
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

My project investigates how one can walk on water. More importantly, it identifies the most significant factors in the process. My initial hypothesis was that surface tension and viscosity would be these variables. <br><br> <br><br>I designed and built a rig to impact a nylon force cell onto still water and measure the resulting force upon surface impact and while travelling through the water. I used an air cylinder to provide my force sensor with a constant downward velocity. The piston achieved a speed 2.2m/s in a pressure range of 30-123 psi. To assure that my actual results were repeatable, I did over 20 tests. All of the results showed two phenomenon-forces, surface related and “bulk” related. This supports my claim of two forces-variables being present. I calculated that surface tension accounted for an insignificant amount of the surface force; thus the surface force must have a different physical origin. <br><br> <br><br>I developed two water walks. The dry water walk uses the surface force and standard vertical velocity, with a land speed of ~1500mph. The wet water walk uses 10cm of the lesser bulk force, combined with a vertical velocity of 7m/s and a land speed of ~100mph. In addition I calculated that for a 10kg machine, also going 10cm into the bulk, with only 28 steps per second it would be able to do the water walk.<br><br>So yes, if you are fast enough, you can do the water walk! But you would most likely want to get wet while doing it.

SWINGING ENERGY
Adam Baxter Jones
White Hall Junior High School, White Hall, AR

The purpose of my experiment is to prove that a changing magnetic field going over a copper coil can produce enough energy to make a light bulb light up. To do the experiment, you ahve to follow these steps. First, collect the materials. Then, build the frame for the pendulum. Next, construct the pendulum by super gluing the magnets to the bottom of the bicycle rim. Next, mount the copper coil under the magnets. Then, wire all the electronic devices together. Next, perorm the experiment. Then, record the data into a graph. Last, repeat the experiment with the pendulum set at a different angle each time to complete the grap. Collect and record the data found for each angle. The data I collected was different almost every time. Based on my research and tests performed, my project was a success. The changing magnetic field over the copper coil caused the light bulb to light up. I found that this can be used as a type of generator, if the pendulum was constantly swinging the entire time it was needed.

THE DEPENDENCE OF GPS ACCURACY ON IONOSPHERIC ELECTRON DENSITY
Cayley Erin Dymond
North Point High School for Science, Technology, and Industry, Waldorf, MD

This project studied whether or not the ionospheric electron density affected the position accuracy of a GPS receiver. I gathered position data from my GPS receiver without the ionosphere correction (WAAS – Wide Area Augmentation System) turned on and compared it to the actual position of my receiver. I looked up the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere for each day and discovered that the TEC was highest during the day, peaking at 1 P.M. After examining the plots that I created of the TEC versus the position error of my GPS, I determined that the error was greatest when the TEC was highest. This proved my hypothesis correct, which stated that the position accuracy decreased when the electron density was highest (which was during the middle of the day). I also found out that the errors were lowest at 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., which was not what I expected; I thought the lowest error would be when the electron density was lowest in the middle of the night. My results might be able to help people understand and study ionospheric waves or changes and improve navigation and land surveying.

TENNIS BALLS: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE DEAD
Suman Gunasekaran
James Madison Memorial High School, Madison, WI

Tennis balls usually last for two or three matches, though it depends on the intensity of play and the age of the ball. To determine their playability, we do one or more of the following: bounce it and see how high it bounces; squeeze it and feel the internal pressure; examine it and decide if the fuzz is worn out. These methods are too subjective. During tennis tournaments and in clubs where there are hundreds of balls used, it becomes very difficult to determine playability of used balls. If there is an objective way to test the playability, it would help save money and time. My hypothesis was that the playability of a tennis ball can be determined by measuring its diameter. My eventual goal is to design a machine that will quickly and correctly test playability of used tennis balls. My objectives were: to measure internal pressure, diameter, and bounce height of used tennis balls; to compare these with corresponding measurements of new tennis balls; and to develop correlations and determine which measurement is the best. I collected 30 each of Wilson and Penn tennis balls that have been played for different durations in a local tennis tournament. I consulted my tennis coach and grouped the balls into three categories (10 balls each): good, bad, and dead. I also tested 3 brand new Wilson and Penn balls as controls. The ball diameters were measured using an image analysis system. The internal pressure was measured using a material testing machine. The peak compression force was recorded and the ball stiffness was calculated using Hertz contact theory. The bounce height was calculated by measuring the duration between two successive bounces using an infrared photo transistor switch. Each set of data showed an expected trend of good balls being slightly better than the bad and the dead balls. The difference between the bad and dead balls is not easily detectable. All the measured parameters exhibited a trend from high to low as the balls classified were from good, bad, and dead; however, the differences in parameter values were much higher between the good and the bad than between the bad and the dead. Ball diameter appeared to serve as a useful indicator of its playability, but further tests are needed. Wide variations observed among the balls grouped as good, bad, and dead are indication of the problems with the current method of judging the playability.

SENSITIVITY TO INITIAL CONDITIONS IN A SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL
Alexander Duchene
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

I created a computer model of the solar system using a Java program and data from the JPL HORIZONS systems. Paths of 100 asteroids were simulated using a restricted N-body problem model and a modified fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical solution routine implementing adaptive step sizing to prevent numerical artifacts. The position and velocity data of each asteroid was randomly altered by up to 0.1% on each component vector of position and velocity, and a new path was found. The process was repeated 10 times per asteroid. The original and modified paths were compared. I found increasing error as time increased. I next performed a linear regression and found a linear relationship between peak error and the number of orbits, with a Pearson product-moment coefficient squared of r2=0.96. An exponential regression was performed, and I found a lower r2=0.81. This means that divergence is not chaotic.

TRANSPORT STUDIES OF MAGNETISM IN INDIVIDUAL GOLD NANOPARTICLES
Austin Evanne Coye
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Gold Nanoparticles surrounded by ligands have magnetic properties that could potentially be useful in the production of micro-sized computer chips. Nanoparticles could potentially lead to novel applications in emerging technologies. The magnetic behavior has recently observed in gold nanoparticles below a few nanometers and experiment is designed to study the intrinsic magnetic nature of individual gold nanoparticles with the use of single-electron transistors (SET) in which an individual gold nanoparticle is placed between two metallic electrodes separated by just a few nanometers. Quantum scale transistors (made up of an individual nanoparticle), show that when the voltage is increased on this scale, the current increases in steps. Due to this, SETs can be used to carefully determine the energy states of an individual gold nanoparticle by appropriately selecting the voltages applied to the transistor. Magnetic fields are used to identify the magnetic nature of the nanoparticle states with the aim of elucidating the origin of the magnetic behavior of small gold nanoparticles. The devices are obtained by deposition of a homogeneous layer of gold nanoparticles in a chip containing a large number of SETs. The chip is then inserted into a cryostat and cooled down to approximately 4K using a combination of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen. Preliminary results demonstrate our ability to obtain gold nanoparticle-based SETs and confirm that the magnetism of the gold particles has an effect on the discrete energy levels of the particle.

OPTICAL BIREFRINGENCE MEASUREMENTS OF COMPRESSED AEROGEL
Jackson Benjamin Blankstein
A.W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, FL

In the field of low temperature Physics, silica aerogel has been found to be the perfect impurity to combine with helium three (3He) in which to hold up in ultra low temperatures. More recently, it has been speculated that combining 3He with silica aerogel at a certain compression will bring about an entirely new superfluid never observed before. Before doing that, it is needed to quantitatively investigate physical changes caused by the different levels of compression in aerogel. Using a spectrophotometer, I performed birefringence measurements in 98% porosity aerogel subjected to uniaxial compression up to 15%. I observed significant compression rate dependent optical birefringence. I preformed the research as dictated by the procedure designed by Bhupathi, et. al., under review. I carried out the actual experimentation, including cutting the aerogel and operating the microspectrophotometer for every trial of every sample. I also compiled and analyzed all of the data in the program Origin 7 Pro.

SKYDIVE SAFELY: A DEVELOPED SKYDIVING SUIT THAT INFLATES IN CASE OF PARACHUTE FAILURE
Fatimah Ahmed Alkhunaizi
Saad National School, Khobar, Eastern Province, SAUDI ARABIA

The purpose of this project is to make skydiving safer and decrease the significant number of fatalities caused by its accidents, using a modified helium inflated skydiving suit. This is based on the hypothesis that if the skydiving suit was inflated with helium, the skydiver’s terminal velocity will decrease, which results in preventing fatal injuries when colliding with ground upon failure of parachute. <br><br>At an altitude of 600 m, a skydiver's parachute should be deployed, which decreases acceleration. If acceleration is not decreased at this level, it will be considered as a parachute failure situation and the skydiving suit will inflate with helium. The acceleration of the skydiver is measured using an accelerometer sensor and a programmable logic controller (PLC). <br><br>The regular skydiving suit was padded with large, pressed nylon bags. An aluminum cylinder containing a large amount of compressed helium was attached to the back of the suit. Plastic tubes embedded in the suit connect the cylinder with the bags. A small PLC and an accelerometer were also placed in a compartment at the back of the suit. <br><br>Calculations were done to determine terminal velocity and force of impact with ground (with and without the helium inflated suit). <br><br>Using the developed suit, the surface area of the skydiver will double, however the total weight will only increase by 0.5 kg. This results in increased drag force and decreased terminal velocity for the skydiver. Therefore, the force of impact with ground will decrease by 27 Newtons. This results in reducing fatal accidents and thus supporting project hypothesis.

MAGNETIZING OF CORONA PLASMA IN AN ELECTRO-HYDRODYNAMIC THRUSTER
Garen Manoogian, Karan Doshi, 
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

This project, in its present is a result of experimentation on the effects of a magnetic field, on the propulsion of Electro-Hydrodynamic Thrusters. The aim was to derive the origin of the force that causes “Thruster” propulsion. The problem currently lays in the popular theory proposed by NASA, that the propulsion of the device is an Ion-Wind Effect. However, recent test by a private company proved that such a device was fully capable of operating in a high vacuum; hence, throwing off the current Ion-Wind Theory proposed by NASA. The problem is that neither NASA, nor the private company has been able to successfully prove why “Thrusters” function in a vacuum. Our project was designed to determine what causes “Thrusters” to work in a vacuum. We did this by conducting a series of experiments, which tested each variable of physics, from electrostatics to electromagnetism, and found our most promising results, for proving how “Thrusters” worked in a vacuum, from test involving electromagnetism. We designed an experiment to measure the various forces and variables that affected the Thruster during propulsion test. We were able to deduce, from mathematical calculations and theoretical principles, by magnetizing the corona plasma of “Thrusters,” a theory that solves the question proposed by NASA. The contributions of this project are twofold. First, it examined the connection between magnetic fields and ion propulsion. Such actions might serve to synchronize the different aspects of physics that describe this phenomenon. Second, the benefits of this technology being implemented into spacecraft, and aircraft are limitless.

SPIRAL GALAXIES: ROTATION CURVE AND DEMONSTRATION OF STAR MOTION
Olga Kubasova, Ivan Lartsov, 
Municipal School # 55, Nizhny Novgorod, RUSSIA

Galaxies are the most complicated hierarchical objects among all astronomical ones. The way of their evolution has not recognized yet. The range of star masses inside galaxies varies from 10 million solar masses up to 10 trillion ones and it is the most variation inside the types of objects. We decided to model some processes in galaxies. The first step was to model the rotation of galaxies. We proposed the realistic model of spiral galaxy with uniform density in the central spherical domain and decreasing density in the “wings” of the disk. Then we found the period of stars rotation around the center of the galaxy being the effect of gravity law. This period as a function of the center distance in the terms of star velocities is called “rotation curve”. Than we had chosen the model parameters similar to those for our Galaxy and found that the rotational curve looks realistic. We realize that as spiral galaxies pattern revolves like a solid body, real stars motions are more complicated than simple rotation with constant velocity. However, two motions (stars and their patterns) cannot be described in the framework of simple equations. Next we found that there were no adequate demonstration of galaxies rotation in all TV programs and special lectures (e.g. in planetarium). That is why we tried after all to formulate the principles of demonstrations for rotation of galaxies. They can be used in planetarium as well as in lectures and presentations about galaxies.

ENGINEERING A SYSTEM TO RECORD HEAD RELATED TRANSFER FUNCTIONS OF SOUNDS FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS
Jordan David Zesch, Angad Jolly, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) describe how the pinnae, head, and torso distort sound waves. Sound waves from various directions are distorted in distinct ways, assisting with spatial hearing. The purpose of this project was to record HRTFs from various directions of sound sources. Sensitive microphones were placed where the tympanic membrane would be in a geometrically accurate model head with facial features and detailed pinnae. A maximum length sequence (MLS) with 12 identical blocks was played from a car speaker from 7 directions in 30º increments around the left side of the head in the azimuth plane. The microphones generated audio files that showed amplitude over time. A Discrete Fourier Transform was performed on these files to show amplitude of various frequencies. Differences between HRTFs were most pronounced in the left channel, closest to the ear. Higher frequencies increased in amplitude as sources moved towards 9:00 (due left) while low frequencies stayed relatively constant. The biggest change in amplitude patterns occurred between 5000 to 13000 Hz, which makes sense because human hearing ranges from 20-20,000 Hz. Distinctive amplitude troughs appeared every 5000 Hz and were the most recognizable differences between the various HRTFs. The HRTFs from the microphone on the far side of the head showed little difference from direction to direction. The most noticeable difference was an overall increase in amplitude as the speaker moved from 10:00 to 12:00. In conclusion, the spatial hearing information from HRTFs comes mostly from the ear closer to a sound source.

THE EFFECTS OF LUBRICANTS ON SPEED.
Andrew Steven Kier, Matthew Curran, 
North Andrew R-6, Rosendale, MO

An air cannon will be consructed from PVC pipe, pressure gauge, and valve. Water balloons were used as projectiles. For each trial a different lubricant is applied to the projectile. The speed of the projectile will be recorded and compared. The speed will be recorded using a video recorder connected to the computer to pause and play to certain times of the launch and use the differences in distances of the projectile and compare them to the times paused to figure out the speed of the projectile. Then repeat twice for each lubricant sample. After doing the experiment, it has been found that the hypothesis of the super oil will produce the least friction was correct. The Super Oil allowed the projectile to reach the greatest speed which determines that the friction was the least friction of all the lubricants. The Powered Graphite fell right in line producing the amount of friction second only to the Super Oil. Following according behind them are the Silicone Lubricant, and the Dry Lubricant,the WD-40, the White Lithium Greece, and the and the combination lube and penetrating oil. Given the chance to do this again it is suggested doing more trials with more lubricants.

A beta spectrometer is a device used to detect the speed of beta particles. The purpose of our project was to build a reliable beta spectrometer using low cost items. To build our spectrometer, we used PVC pipe as the main chamber. We built our own collimator, parallel plate capacitor, and a high-voltage supply source, which together were used to deviate our beta particles. Two dismantled web cams make up our beta detector at the other side of our chamber. Creating a vacuum inside the chamber, we were able to detect beta particles with one of our cameras. Then, turning on our parallel plate capacitor, we were able to deviate the particles to hit the second camera. With the deviation known, we used that distance and put it in our equation that we derived from cinematic equations to find the velocity of the beta particles. Our homemade beta spectrometer showed that the velocity of the beta particles is 1.19x10^8 m/s, but in reality, beta particles emitted from Strontium-90 is 1.09x10^8 m/s. We have a 9.9% error and we are continuing to make our spectrometer as accurate as possible.

FLOWING OF MAGNETIC FLUID WITH FREE SURFACE
Tomas Sabados, Michal Sikora, 
Gymnazium sv. Tomasa Akvinskeho, Kosice, SLOVAKIA

Liquid flows driven by surface tension and their tendency to decay spontaneously into drops have been of great scientific interest. However, little is known about is phenomenon for magnetic fluids. Our project is devoted to the first experiment study of stream of magnetic fluid flowing from a nozzle in the bottom of a container without magnetic field and in presence of magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the jet. Jet was recorded by camcorder and from video the intact length ”l” of the jet before breakup into drops in dependence on the time ( which is connected to initial flow velocity “v” at the nozzle ) was measured. According our result the overall dependence “l” versus “v” can be divided into two regions; for large value of “v” value of “l” decreases with decreasing “v” but suddenly the slope is changed and “l” is less dependent on “v” until it falls down to zero. Al first region the jet breaking is governed by capillary instability and is known as Rayleight regime. In the frame of Rayleight the linear dependence of breakup length vs. velocity is predicted and slope “k” is connected with the time of perturbation development. We observe tat the slope “k” increases in perpendicular magnetic field for both magnetic fluids. Also perpendicular magnetic field cause the jet is less stable( large oscillation of “l” around mean value are observed ). In parallel magnetic field the 1th region can be observed only for water magnetic fluid and there is small increase of “k”. At 2nd region ( smaller velocity ) influence of gravity cannot be nucleated. According our observation in this region “l” is almost independent on “v” and jet is more stable. Considerable influence of parallel magnetic field we observe in the 2nd region of jetting for oil based magnetic fluid. We found pronounced increase of “l” and transition to dropping regime for smaller value of “v” in presence of parallel magnetic field. It means that applying of parallel magnetic field can control dropping to jetting transition what could have partical using for example in ink jet printing controlled by magnetic field.

Red eye effect is the condition where the pupil appears red in a color photo of an individual. Some individuals have red occur more often than others. The goal of this experiment was to see what variables cause red eye to occur. We tested many variables including eye and hair colors, angles from where the pictures were taken, and camera types and settings to see which had the greatest effect. Then we compared specific examples with the chi-squared data test. All of the previously mentioned variables were independent. The controlled variable in each photo was the two meter distance between the test subject and the camera. The dependant variable was the amount of red eye in each photo. Pictures were taken of every combination of these variables and the amount of red eye was recorded in a table. The amount of red eye was judged on a zero to three scale.<br><br>The results showed that the automatic flash setting had the greatest amount of red eye out of all the camera settings while the 35mm had the least. Blue eyes were more prone to red eye than brown eyes. At first glance brand one seemed worse than the second brand but the Chi-squared test showed no statistical difference. This experiment supported the hypothesis that red eye is affected by many variables.

Developing a control circuit with variable resistors enabled testing the effect of amperage on the electromagnets.<br><br>To measure the strength of various electromagnets, a ball bearing was placed at a distance from the electromagnet and pushed toward it until the electromagnetic field accelerated the ball towards the electromagnet; then a ball bearing was placed at a specified distance from the electromagnet and a camera in burst mode was used to record the ball bearing’s speed. The tests were repeated for different amperages.<br><br>The data showed that electromagnets always work best at their highest possible amperage. As the current in an electromagnet increases, the strength increases; as the turns increase, the strength increases. The gauge of the wire affected both factors. There is a trade-off between turns and current: higher gauge wire offering more turns but less current; lower gauge wire more current but fewer turns. Lower gauge wire is generally better. A permanent magnet is more strongly attracted than a ball bearing or flooring nail.

CREATION OF PERIODIC GRAIN CONVECTIONS BY CONFINEMENT
Chung-Kuan Lin, Cher-Chia Yeh, 
The Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, CHINESE TAIPEI

The motions of a grain, embedded in an assembly of background-grains, initiated by shaking have been investigated. Migration of this target-grain may be created when the size, mass, or materials of the target-grain is different from that of the background-ones. It is the imbalance in the friction around the target-grain that triggers the motion. We focus on discussing the physical parameters that control the granular convection. The migration speed of the target-grain is found to be increased as the friction around the grain or the shaking frequency is increased. It is also realized that a heavier target-grain will reduce the speed of its motion. On the other hand, a bigger target-grain results in a reduction, rather than an increase, in the migration speed in horizontal shaking. An up-and-down circulation of the target-grain in the background-ones may also be created by horizontal shaking. The time required for each circulation of this kind may be described by using a sinusoidal function plus a baseline constant, with a period that is sensitive to the depth of assembly. The baseline constant indicated the minimum depth that the target-grain will reach, that however, is insensitive to the depth of the assembly.

VORTEX-INDUCED "FACE-LIFT"
Ting-An Ku, Ching-Yao Lai,

A lid on top of a cylindrical container filled with a layer of oil over another layer of water is set to spin. As one increases the angular velocity of the lid, the motion of the binary fluid turns out to be much more complicated and interesting than one’s intuition might have suggested: the oil-water interface goes through a series of morphology, first forming a bulge upward to a mound with a plateau, which itself develops yet another mound when the spin exceeds certain threshold. Depending on the height of the driving lid, a further increase in the spin can cause the plateau or the “double mound” configuration to develop a stable carrousel structure around its edge. The whole interfacial structure is quite robust, and it remains stable until a final critical spin is reached, beyond which the interface simply disrupts, leading to a chaotic mixing of the oil and the water. At each stage of interfacial morphology, vortex breakdown with a vortex ring resembling a goblet and later a vase can also be observed in the oil layer. In this project, we investigated how the height and the angular velocity of the lid affect the shape of the interface and the vortex ring in the oil layer and obtained several scaling relations.

The project seeks to solve permanently the problem of power supply in many nations through the provision of cheap, clean and renewable electrical energy.<br><br>The project work based on the principles of Flemning Left Hand Rule<br><br>The power for the initial take off is supplied by two 12V batteries arranged in the series. Two opto-couplars alternately positioned on the serrated edge of the shaft does the switching on/off of the generator. The rotation of the shaft consisting of eight neodymium magnets causes a magnetic field cutting through the four field coils and four armature coils, each consisting of 250 turns of 22 standard wire gauge (s.w.g.)., energizing those coils and causing a rotation. The intermittent but continuous switching on/off from the opto-couplars causes a collapsing of the magnetic field around the coils thereby inducing voltage into the coil. This induced electromotive force is higher than the input power. The battery can be disconnected at this point. The current is smoothened by a set of capacitors which also help to serve as a form of backup. This makes power generation perpetual until it is switched off.<br><br>The generator does not use fuel and so it is very cheap to operate and does not emit any toxic waste products or noise as with other conventional electrical energy sources.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO ASTEROID IDENTIFICATION USING IMAGE PROCESSING OF EXISTING DATA

Asteroids are dangerous objects for Earth, as evidenced by previous asteroid impacts that have had planet-wide effects. Asteroid orbits are easily perturbed, or changed, by the gravitational pull of other solar bodies. For this reason, it is vitally important to carefully track the motion of all potentially dangerous asteroids in our solar system.<br><br> <br><br>In this project, we analyze existing astronomical data for asteroid sightings. A large-scale analysis of existing image data could lead to identifying new asteroids, to better understanding the patterns in asteroid orbit perturbations, and to more effective ongoing observations. <br><br> <br><br>Our study begins with obtaining astronomical images for analysis and corresponding stars from a reference catalog. Using this data, we then compare the stars in the image to the stars in the sky by finding similar triangles between corresponding stars. This enables us to determine the exact location and orientation of the image in the sky. Any unknown objects that are in the image are then translated to a location in the sky, constituting one object observation. We can further analyze these observations to find previously unknown asteroids or to document perturbed asteroids.<br><br> <br><br>We have developed software to identify potential asteroid observations in astronomical images. We have made our methods versatile by investigating ways of making the image analysis techniques applicable to a wide variety of images. Our program has successfully been applied to a variety of astronomical images and has identified possible asteroid observations in these images.

A SHOCKING TWIST “CAN VARIABLE CCONTACT POINTS EFFECT DIRECTION?”
Parker David Caviness, Todd Thrash, 
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL

Our project was designed to observe how spin affects the directional pattern of a soccer ball. For our testing procedure, we first built a kicking mechanism in order to achieve an identical kick every time we test. We then stretched a line from the kicking mechanism to the center of a stake we posted exactly 701mm (23’) away. To test the rotational effect, we would leave the kicking mechanism stationary and move the ball over in increments of 30mm, 45mm, and 60mm from the center of the ball on both the left and right side. <br><br>• Results are as follows: <br><br>Left. 30mm over 1st 132mm 2nd 154mm 3rd 137mm <br><br>45mmover 1187mm 2nd27Omm 3rd19.1 <br><br>60mm over 1st 306mm 2nd 207mm 3rd 290mm <br><br>Right: 30mm over 1 37mm 2nd 34m 3rd 36 <br><br>45mm over 1st 99fl. 2nd 101mm 3rd 97m <br><br>60mmover ISI186mm 2l60mm 3rdl8Qr <br><br>In conclusion, we discovered that our hypothesis was remotely accurate with the exception of a few overlooked variables. We learned about the physics of a soccer kick and the several factors of spin that affect directional change such as wind resistance and the “Magnus Effect”. In other words, we discovered the rotational effect on direction first hand (through a series of tests) and through our research. This helped us reach an understanding of the relation of sports and physics in several aspects. Finally, we understand that there is an applied science behind every activity.

ENERGY FROM SPARK DISCHARGES--AMAZING OVERUNITY OR EXPERIMENTAL ERROR?
Walter Preston Hansen, Riley Densley, 
Bingham High School, South Jordan, UT

As published in "Physics Letters A" Antanasijevic et al. (2002) reported the results of their simple air-spark experiment showing more energy out than in—“overunity” energy. Our experiment replicated and extended this work to test the overunity claim.<br><br><br>We constructed a simple air-spark apparatus fed by a high voltage capacitor bank. During the spark discharge we carefully monitored the energy going into and out of the apparatus by measuring the voltage on each side of the spark gap and the series current. The energy out of the apparatus fed a power resistor that converted the electrical energy to heat. The electrical energies were calculated numerically. The ratio of output energy to input energy determined whether or not anomalous overunity energy was present.<br><br> <br><br>We made 40 energy runs over several weeks. When calculated with the Int(VI)dt method, normal discharge loss of 2-5% was observed. When calculated using the Int(Ri2)dt method-the method used by Antanasijevic et al. (2002), the energy output depended on how the resistor value was measured.<br><br> <br><br>Because of this dependence on the resistance measurement method, we expended extraordinary effort to accurately measure and analyze resistance data with high precision in order to draw valid conclusions. We concluded that a power-weighted average resistance is most accurate in measuring spark discharge events. Using this method no overunity was measured, contradicting the 2002 result. We also tested the spark gap in a magnetic field to determine if this affected the energy out/in, and found that it did not.

Do small isolated dark nebulae still have the ability to form stars? This study endeavors to answer this question. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, data were obtained of LDN 981 using the MIPS and IRAC instruments, which detect a range of infrared wavelengths. These data were reduced using APT to provide photometric information about infrared sources in this dark cloud. The photometry was used to create spectral energy distribution charts with Excel. These were compared to SEDs from known objects in an attempt to classify the IR sources found in this study. From seven identified sources of excess infrared emission, 2 potential class I protostars were found.

CONSTRUCTION OF BINARY STAR ORBITAL MODELS USING MINIMAL DATA ON MEASUREMENTS OF SEPARATION AND POSITION ANGLES
Eframir Franco-Diaz, Jennifer Cruz-Bonilla, 
Petra Mercado Bougart High School, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

The measurements of separation and position angles of Binary Stars are the key to determine the mass and orbit, which can later give us the magnitudes and other information of these systems. The problem of this investigation is to know if a Binary Star orbital model can be constructed with minimal data on measurements of separation and position angles. The hypothesis is that a Binary Star orbital model can be constructed with minimal data on measurements of separation and position angles. The images of the stars used in this investigation were taken from the 31 inch NURO Telescope, located in the Anderson Mesa at Flagstaff, Arizona. The CCD Camera used for the investigation was the NASA - CAM. Some of the data used was obtained from the Washington Double Star Catalog because various observations are from more than a decade old. Several computer softwares were used to calibrate (AIP 4 Windows), take the negative (CCD Soft), zoom (CCD Soft), and pixealize (Photo Impact) the images. Then, the images are ready for the orbital construction. To start with the construction, the degrees are changed to radians so they can be inserted in the Graphmatic computer software to construct the orbit. The equation used to create the Binary Star orbits is the elliptical equation with its transformations and translations {[(x-h)2/a2]+[(y-k)2/b2] =1}. This demonstrates that a Binary Star orbital model can be constructed with minimal data on measurements of separation and position angles.

VOLTAIC ANALYSIS OF "CITRUS LIMONUM", "CITRUS PARADASI", "ALLIUM CEPA" AND "SOLANUM TUBEROSUM"
Pedro J. Hernandez-Rodriguez, Elliot Ramos, 
Abelardo Diaz Alfaro School, Toa Alta, PUERTO RICO

Any fruit or vegetable containing acid can generate a voltage. The problem was which of these fruits or vegetables, Citrus limonum, Citrus paradasi, Allium cepa and Solanum tuberosum will generate a greater voltage either cut into pieces or as the whole fruit when connected in series or in parallel circuits and if it can turn on a LED and a lightbulb? The hypothesis was that Citrus limonum will generate more voltage than the other fruits in either form when it is connected in series and in parallel circuits and that a LED and a lightbulb can be turned on. Each of the fruits and vegetables were cut into four pieces and connected in series and in parallel circuits. The voltage was measured and a LED was connected to each of the circuits. This process was repeated for each whole fruit using four of them each time. At the end all the whole fruits and vegetables were connected in a parallel circuit and a lightbulb was connected. Voltage was higher both in the series and parallel circuits with Citrus limonum when the pieces of fruits were used, but was greater with the whole fruit of Citrus paradasi when was connected in parallel. The LED turned on with all the connections and the lightbulb turned on when all the whole fruits were connected in parallel. The conclusion is that Citrus limonum generated more voltage when it was cut into pieces but Citrus paradasi generated more voltage when the whole fruit was used.

MAGNETOSPHERE PARTICLE INTERACTION
Brandon Tyler Ramirez, Francisco Vigil, Dennis Trujillo
McCurdy High School, Espanola, NM

The cosmic reaction between the magnetosphere and a charged particle is explored through the use of the many different components of our experiment. We decided to approach this project through the use of a computer generated model as well as a physical model in the hope that they will complement each other. In these models we used many different aspects of the disciplines of physics and mathematics to help construct these interpretations of the magnetic field produced by our planet. <br><br> The computational model was based on the Earth's magnetic field so that this representation’s process is non-reliant on the other, but rather offers reassuring evidence or perhaps uncertain results that may be reconsidered. This model is written in the FORTRAN computer language to calculate,within the radiation belt, the magnetic field vector and the interaction between it and the charged particles. We hope to trace the movement of the particles throughout the radiation belt, then possibly predict the movement of masses of particles. The fabricated model was built to bear resemblance to the Earth’s magnetic field so that a proper interaction with particles might occur. The physical model is intended to confirm the data produced by the computational model as well as allow for a visualization of the particle interaction and the phenomenon we hope to gain knowledge from. <br><br> <br><br> Through this we intend to designate areas in the radiation belt which has a relative less particle density in order to lessen spacecraft damage.

THE DESIGN OF A HIGH RESOLUTION AC MAGNETIC SUSCEPTOMETER
Stephen Alexander McCrory
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

Using the principles of electromagnetic induction and basic circuitry, this project theoretically and experimentally evaluates the construction of a device which can detect the magnetization of a sample with a small magnetic susceptibility. The design consists of one exterior, field-generating solenoid and two symmetrically placed interiors solenoids. The analytic frameworks of the design led to the first experimental factor: a demonstration of the electromagnetic physics of the device without a sample present. Specifically, this involved an analysis of the induced voltage in a detection solenoid caused by variable frequencies and voltages across the field-generating solenoid. The calibration data was successful in demonstrating the proportionality of the primary voltage and frequency to the secondary (induced) voltage. The second step in the experimental process was to test the device on a sample. A liquid crystal (in the solid phase) was used for testing; however, the only important property of the sample was its paramagnetism. The intention of the sample testing was to detect the induced electric field through the magnetic field induced in the sample. The data for the sample’s induced electric field showed slight but consistent increases. These increases were not great enough calculate the change electric field with much statistical confidence (and, by extension, susceptibility). Modifications to the design include an increased inductance in the primary solenoid and a larger sample. If these modifications are successful in increasing sensitivity, the whole system could be placed under variable temperature and the phase transition of the sample could be determined.

SELF-ASSEMBLY OF DYW30 MOLECULES ON GRAPHENE-BASED NANOTRANSISTORS
Austin Evanne Coye
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The current research investigates a recently discovered family of molecular nanomagnets based on polyoxometalates (POM) where the magnetism is associated with a single lanthanide ion. Their intrinsic simplicity and homogeneity makes them promising systems for applications in emerging technologies, such as nanospintronics and quantum computation. The monoatomic thickness of graphene allows the use of a third electrode underneath to gate the electrostatic levels of the molecules. This project tested the ability of POMs to self-assemble into graphene flakes and determined the optimal conditions for subsequent deposition of the systems in the graphene-based transistors. For this, DyW30 molecules were deposited at different concentrations and times and the results examined by atomic force microscopy. Self-assembled patterns were found after 10 minute depositions at 2.5x10-5 M. It was also discovered that the molecules are attracted to the graphene when compared to the silicon surface on which the graphene was deposited. This research will continue to develop a novel nanoscale transistor to explore the electrical conduction through individual molecules placed on the surface of graphene, a monolayer of carbon shown to have novel chemical and electric properties.

ISOLATION OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF CORONA PLASMA PARTICLES IN AN ELECTRO-HYDRODYNAMIC THRUSTER
Garen Manoogian
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

This project, in its present is a result of experimentation on the isolation of magnetic fields on the propulsion of Electro-Hydrodynamic Thrusters (EHD). The aim was to derive the force an EHD thruster produces during propulsion test inside of a faraday cage. The problem currently lays in the popular theory proposed by NASA, that the propulsion of the EHD Thrusteris an Ion-Wind Effect. However, recent tests by a private company proved that such a device was fully capable of operating inside of a high vacuum; hence, throwing off the current Ion-Wind Theory proposed by NASA. The problem is neither NASA, nor the private company has been able to successfully prove why "Thrusters" function in a vacuum. I designed an experiment to isolate the magnetic field of the EHD Thruster to see if it contributes to the propulsion factor of an EHD Thruster. I was able to deduce, from my observations by isolating the magnetic properties of corona plasma particles produced by the EHD Thruster the Thruster could produce lift. The focus of this experiment is based on the measurements of the force produced by an EHD Thruster from my previous experimentation of the force measurements of an EHD Thruster in the presence of a magnetic field.

ELECTRONIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SEMI-CONDUCTING NANOTUBES
Justin Wesley Brooks
Lyman High School, Longwood, FL

Field effect transistors used in modern day computing exhibit switch like behavior due to their unique semi-conducting properties. The goal of this project was achieve such behavior using multi-walled semi-conducting carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes were placed on a chip using dielectrophoresis. This chip has a conducting pattern on top of a heavily doped silicon wafer. The nanotube was placed over a gap in the pattern in a manner that it completed a circuit. After the nanotubes were placed in their desired location, they were annealed using heat for stability. The nanotubes were now ready to be measured. An electronic interface connected to a computer program called LabView was used to manipulate the current flowing through the nanotubes. Two electrodes sent a bias voltage, source and drain, through the nanotube while connected to the contact pads on the chip. Meanwhile, a gate voltage was connected to the back gate on the silicon wafer. The source electrode sent a constant voltage through the nanotube while the gate voltage swept through the desired voltages selected on the computer program. The gate voltage can be compared to a signal or a valve. The drain voltage received the new current, and the computer program logged the data. Based on the data, the current was significantly manipulated using a gate voltage. Conclusively, the nanotubes exhibited transistor like behavior, and the switching mechanism was seen in the data. Thus, when silicon reaches its limit, carbon nanotubes will be possible candidates for their use in field effect transistors in order to continue the development of computing.

MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECTS THAT BELL VIBRATIONS HAVE ON THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET
Alan Earl Marcus
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

It was discovered through a previous experiment preformed at a top college in central Florida that the dampening of a trumpet’s bell actually changes the harmonic series and therefore the sound of the instrument when compared to letting the bell freely vibrate. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not the vibration of the trumpet’s bell was a source for this outcome, instead of the lips. In this project, we used a modified computer program in LabView ® that measured the input pressures and output pressures of a frequency fed into a trumpet simultaneously. The horn driver is rigged to a PVC chamber attached to the mouthpiece, and the whole trumpet and chamber setup is mounted on a secure base. Frequencies from 100-2000Hz were played through the mouthpiece, and the two sets of data were recorded by the program and set into a table. This process was used twice, once with the bell open to vibrations, and once while it was dampened. With these data, the output readings were divided by the corresponding input readings to measure the transfer function. The results we obtained were supportive of the proposed hypothesis that there were both audibly (about 2 dB) and visually noticeable differences between the two sets of transfer functions. However, an interesting phenomenon occurred which resulted in some frequencies having the trend change as to which effect, dampened or left free, had a greater transfer function.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY ON THE ACCURACY OF LOCATING AN UNDERWATER OBJECT USING MULTILATERATION
Erin Nicole Lewis
Harmony High School, Harmony, FL

In aircraft surveillance using multilateration calculations, the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of a signal traveling from an aircraft transmitter to multiple receivers is used to determine the location of the transmitter. A sound signal sent from a moveable underwater speaker was recorded through four stationary hydrophone receivers positioned in a rectangular grid off a dock in different temperatures of fresh and brackish water. The hypothesis was that the speaker position could be determined using multilateration within +/- one meter with colder, fresh water being most accurate. The experimental TDOA data was used to estimate seven speaker locations, finding the best fit of the data using multilateration formulas. The error between the experimental TDOA calculations and the theoretical expected TDOA was analyzed by temperature and salinity. No significant difference in error was found for the experimental conditions, but saltier water had more error overall. Sound travels faster in saltier water so the TDOA between hydrophones was smaller and more difficult to measure. Six of seven speaker locations were estimated within +/- 1 m accuracy for the fresh water, while only three positions were within this tolerance for saltier water. A significant difference was found in the amount of error by hydrophone where the mean error ranged from 0.1662 m to –0.9002 m per hydrophone. The hydrophones located closest to the dock where the water was clear had the least error while the hydrophones further from the dock may have been affected by under water obstructions such as silt or weeds.

THE EFFECTS OF THE CORE CONSTRUCTION OF A GOLF BALL ON ITS ELASTICITY
David Thomas Rosenberg
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, U.S.A.

The goal of my project was to explore the effects that the core construction of a golf ball has on a golf ball’s elasticity. Elasticity is the ratio of the velocity at which two objects separate after a collision to the velocity at which the objects come together before the collision. Higher elasticity results in higher ball speed and longer distance golf shots. I measured elasticity using a motion detector positioned one meter above a hard surface. The motion detector measured the position of each golf ball that I dropped and let bounce under it, giving me all the information I needed to calculate its elasticity. In Phase 1 of my project, I tested three different brands of golf balls and a golf ball from each of the three major construction types within each brand (for a total of nine golf balls). I got used to the process of calculating elasticity and got a basic sense of the relationship between core construction and elasticity: the more layers a golf ball has, the less elastic it becomes. In Phase 2, I tested one more brand, but with more trials and one more construction type (5 layers) than in Phase 1, allowing me to get statistically viable results. My results confirmed my hypothesis that golf balls with the least number of layers tend to have the highest elasticity values and, after further analysis, demonstrated that the number of layers can make about a ten meter range difference in a golf shot.

IS LUKE SKYWALKER’S HOME PLANET, TATOOINE, PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE?
Albert D. Kim
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

"Are we alone in the Universe?" Finding habitable planets has become an important topic in modern astronomy. In space, there are not only one-star solar systems but also binary solar systems. While our solar system has one star, binary systems have two stars orbiting each other, resulting in more complicated orbital features for their respective satellite planets. Complicated orbital motion would very likely result in an adverse climatic conditions to host life on the planet. In the George Lucas’ Sci-Fi movie Star Wars, the main character, Luke Skywalker, is from the planet, Tatooine, which has a binary solar system. One of the most important conditions for hosting life is moderate temperature. I am investigating the likelihood of whether a planet having two stars can host life by numerically plotting the possible orbits around the binary solar system and calculating the seasonal variation of the thermal equilibrium temperature of the planet. When two suns are relatively close, the planet on the binary solar system may be habitable. Therefore, Luke Skywalker’s home planet, Tatooine, is physically plausible. In the simulation, we can achieve a planet whose orbital path is stable and surface temperature is around 255 K (-18°C). When two suns are relatively far apart, the planet seems to be inhabitable. The orbital path is irregular and the surface temperature fluctuates too much.

PLASMA PRODUCTION VARYING WITH ELECTRODE GAUGE
Kelly Elizabeth Gray
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

Plasma production is a very useful form of propulsion, especially in space. However, before we can use it in space we must prefect it here on Earth. The purpose of the research is to determine if more force by plasma is produced when the gauge of wire is changed, as well as the size of the grounded electrode.<br><br>The first set of actuators were made using 32, 36, and 40 AWG wire and both the powered and grounded electrodes were the same size. The second set of actuators used the same wize wires, however, this time a 10 cm by 2 mm copper tape was placed on the back to be used as the grounded electrode. Finally, the last set of actuators kept the powered electrode the same, but varied the width of the grounded electrode. Additional actuators varied copper tape with measurements of 10 cm by 4 mm and 10 cm by 6 mm to be used as the grounded electrode. Results of testing indicated that the smaller the wire, the more force is produced by plasma. When there is a larger grounded electrode, such as the 10 cm by 6 mm grounded electrode, more force will be produced by the plasma.

THE DYNAMICS OF INDUCED HOVERING FLIGHT IN AN OSCILLATING AIRFLOW AT VARIOUS FREQUENCIES
Nathaniel James Thompson
Brush High School, Brush, CO

The experiment was conducted to analyze and observe the flight of tissue paper "wings" in an oscillating flow above a sound speaker, which is used to model insect flight. Ten wings with a surface area of sixteen square centimeters were cut out of Japanese tissue paper. This product was used since it is very thin, yet durable. A wind chamber was constructed above a twelve inch subwoofer speaker. The wings were placed in the chamber and were monitored at a range of frequencies between five and seventy-five hertz at both half and full amplitude. Maximum hovering height and overall maximum height were recorded for all wings at all frequencies at both amplitudes. The data was graphed according to maximum height and hover height over the various frequencies. The ideal wing design determined was a wing that was both structurally stable, yet allowed for flapping and a parachute effect. Wings that were stable didn’t flair during flight. The parachute effect of the better wings allowed air to push up under the wing, yet when air was drawn back into the chamber, the wing could shed off the incoming air without losing much of its height. The ideal frequency for most of the wings was between five and thirty hertz, which is unexpected since it is unlike the rapid flapping of insects. From this project, generalizations learned about oscillating flight and wing structure can be used to understand insect development. Aircraft and possibly nanobots can then use these principles.

It relied upon learning and understanding these limits so that this operation can be assessed for practical use. The variables examined were expected to reveal advancements for feasible application. <br><br> Magnetic coupling involves a pulsing electromagnetic field which is corresponding with a set alternating current. A coil of wires is then placed in an area surrounded by the field for induction of a current. The current induced is manipulated by the field to generate an alternating current that corresponds with the field; alike with the original current. The variables of coil variance-changing the amount of coils-and displacement were then put through a series of tests to produce the data necessary to achieve a conclusion upon the subject. <br><br> The two variables prospected, limited the procedure. Coil variance proved to affect the signal transmission in both frequency and amplitude; whilst displacement acted alike. The receiver with an increased coil amount produced a frequency with a 71% more accurate signal in comparison to the receiver with less coils. Displacement based experiments revealed a 79% drop in signal accuracy when moving from a group of less displacement to the group with an increased displacement.<br><br> These results convey conclusions for both of the investigated elements. A coil amount on the receiver will induce more accurate signals; displacement will decrease signal accuracy as it increases. These two factors demonstrated great potential for applying magnetic coupling.

RESEARCH OF EMISSION CURRENT IN LUMINESCENT LAMPS
Oleg Fedorovich Sevryukov
Lyceum # 87, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhegorodskaya, RUSSIA

The aim of my project is studying of found phenomenon of emission current in luminescent lamp, determining its nature and demonstration of practical importance of the experiment.<br><br>The glowing of luminophore in lamp is caused by ultraviolet component of mercury spectrum. A single electrode (filament-type cathode) is attached to power supply and dependence of filament current on voltage is measured. The experiment shows 11 V voltage drop along cathode, this value is enough to ionize mercury atoms during motion of electrons along cathode as well as from cathode to anode. As a result the emission component of filament current occurs being parallel to the current in metal conductor. Thus second electrode is not necessary for glowing.<br><br>The resistance of metal conductor grows with temperature linearly while number of emitted electrons grows exponentially. Thus total resistance depends on temperature significantly and can even fall starting with some temperature. Extrapolating range 0-11V one can predict ‘metal’ resistance near 11 V (above ignition point). Then one can find ‘metal’ current from voltage and resistance data and find ‘emission’ component subtracting this value from total current.<br><br>This component has a significant fraction in total current (10-15%) that is important while determining filament temperature from experimentally measured total resistance. The electron work function can also be determined experimentally; it corresponds to work function for oxide cathodes.<br><br>The phenomenon being found and studied allows one to view processes in cathode zone in more details, to determine real value of cathode temperature measuring its resistance, to develop lamps of different constructions and to use low-voltage ignition instead of high voltage.

SANDSTORM IN A TEACUP: PATTERNS IN A VIBRATED GRANULAR LAYER
Ivan Alexandrovich Lazarevich
Lyceum # 40, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhegorodskaya, RUSSIA

Forecasting granular matter distribution in space with its varied disturbances is necessary for prediction and prevention of subversive consequences of cataclysms in nature: sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides. The project is devoted to both experimental and theoretical studies of granular matter dynamics under vibration at microscales. <br><br>The laboratory vibration table was used to produce analyzer-controllable vertical oscillations of the sand layer placed in the vessels of various shapes. The visual data was acquired using digital video camera. The waveform, magnitude and frequency of vibrations and the depth of the vibrated layer could be varied, allowing study the dependence of the structural relief of material upon these parameters. <br><br>With the layer depth of the order of 2 cm some “star-like” radial patterns on the sand surface are observed, the scale of these patterns decreasing as the frequency is increased, and they gradually die out and convectional flows start prevailing in the sand relief (as in Earth’s mantle at earthquakes). At less sand depth the cellular or labyrinthine patterns are formed depending upon the vibration parameters. In some areas throughout the surface of the layer the resonance sand bursts (oscillons) are seen. Under certain conditions the clearly defined heterogeneity of the layer appears through its depth as moving “thick-thin layer” interfaces. <br><br>Patterns seen in the experiments are similar to some known solutions of the parametric Landau-Ginzburg equation. Some numerical simulations of molecular-dynamics motion were performed showing applicability of such simple model.<br><br>The results of this study can also be used when developing the technologies of industrial processes concerned with mixing and separating multi-component granular materials.

SOLAR SAILS: WHICH DESIGN IS MOST EFFICIENT?
Noah James Gagnon
Gagnon Home School, Goodrich, MI

With today’s growing use of satellites and other spacecraft for exploration, much research is being done to develop faster, lighter, and more efficient space vehicles. One of the avenues being explored involves the use of large reflective “solar sails” to propel a spacecraft using thrust from sunlight. James Clerk Maxwell proposed in 1873 that the photons which make up sunlight exert force on objects. This was confirmed in the early 20th century by the experiment of Nichols and Hull. This experiment was formulated to research the ability and efficiency of flat, concave, and convex sails to propel a payload. The three sail types would be tested with a light source shining directly on them, and then at a forty-five degree angle. Thus, the best sail for sailing directly away from the sun, and the best for sailing at an angle would be determined. It was hypothesized that, if the force on the sail was great enough to be measured, the flat sail would perform best when struck directly, followed by the concave and convex sails. When struck at a forty-five degree angle, the convex sail would be most effective, followed by the concave and flat sails. To perform the experiment, a device based on the one Nichols and Hull used was constructed. A sail was placed in the device, and a bright LED spotlight was shone on it. However, no movement was detected which could be attributed to the light, even when modifications were made to increase the sensitivity of the device. It was concluded that the light force was not significant enough to be measured in this manner. A very large sail would be needed to propel a small mass. This experiment was enjoyable, though, as well as being educational about the principles behind solar sailing.

NONLINEAR DIFFUSION DYNAMICS MEASURED BY USING A SIMPLE LIGHT-TRANSMISSION METHOD
Yu-Sheng Huang
National Chia-yi Senior High School, Chaiyi City, CHINESE TAIPEI

Refractive index of a liquid is known to depend strongly on the molecular concentration of the liquid. It is known that a concentration gradient will be generated in the interface regime when two liquids are brought in contact. When a line laser beam is directed onto the interface of two liquids will produce a Gaussian line upon transmission. The transmitted Gaussian profile is very sensitive to the concentration gradient in the interface regime. We setup a simple apparatus which is able to measure this transmitted profile timely. By measuring the time evolution of such transmitted Gaussian profiles, the diffusion dynamics between two liquids can then be revealed.<br><br>The alternations of diffusion coefficient with temperature and concentration of a glycerol-water solution are studied. Surprisingly, the thermal evolution of diffusion coefficient departs from the expected Einstein’s Diffusion Law, but exhibits a nonlinear characteristic at all concentrations studied. Significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient is also found when the glycerol weight concentration exceed 70%. These behaviors reveal the significance of the interaction between glycerol molecules, when is compared with the interaction between water and glycerol. In other systems where the two liquids are not mutually dissolvable, such as sodium thiosulfate-water solution, the Einstein’s Diffusion Law becomes applicable.

A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF SPIRAL GALAXY EVOLUTION
Harrison Hugh Gaebler
Bloomington High School North, Bloomington, IN

The purpose of this project was to create a mathematical model that can be used to explain why the arm features characteristic of different spiral galaxy morphologies exist. Isolated spiral galaxies evolve from the Sa, to the Sb, and finally to the Sc morphology. These morphologies are distinguished, in part, by spiral arm width. The proposed mathematical model explains this distinction in terms of density wave propagation speeds. <br><br> Propagation speed was determined for a single galaxy, NGC 3898, by calculating spiral arm width from known distance and angular width as viewed in the SAO-ds9 FITS image viewer. Then, a standardized propagation speed for density waves could be established by arbitrarily stating that “x” number of observed density waves correspond to “y” number of standardized density waves. The next step was to establish a rate of change of standardized density waves, ds/dt, by making an assumption about the average main sequence lifetime of the massive blue giant stars (15 million years) that we observe in most spiral galaxy arms. The last step was to calculate the total number of standardized density waves that had propagated throughout the observed galaxy’s history. The integral of ds/dt from 0.75 to 13.7 billion years after the big bang yields a reasonable estimate of the total number of standardized density waves (5.72x108).<br><br> If the further application of this model to all morphologies corresponds to the known morphological evolution from Sa to Sc, it will imply that density waves are directly causally related to spiral galaxy evolution.

SOUNDS FROM ABOVE
Monica Alejandra Torres
United High School, Laredo, TX

My project is on the Yagi antenna. The antenna can be used to detect objects in the sky using radio waves. As objects pass through the sky they emit radio waves that are picked up by the antenna. The antenna has 3 main components: the directors, the collector, and the reflectors. The directors “direct” the signal to the collector. Then the collector detects the signal and sends it to the FM receiver. The receiver amplifies the signal and sends it to the data collector. Then the computer analyzes the data and records it into graphs. That is the function of the Yagi Antenna.The hypothesis was that if all objects in the sky emit radiation across different frequencies, can they be detected by tuning in to the right frequency. Radio frequencies were indeed detected. The materials needed for this project were: the antenna, an FM receiver, an Analog to Digital Converter, a recording device, and a coaxial cable. The first step in this experiment was placing the antenna in a desired location. Second, run a coaxial cable from the antenna to the FM receiver. Third, run a stereo wire from the FM receiver line out connecter to the line in entrance on the PC. Fourth, was to turn on the FM receiver and select the chosen frequency. In this experiment I chose 100.00 MGHZ because it gave me loud and clear sound. Fifth, was to start the recording program on the computer. The program used in this experiment was called Gold Wave. It displays peaks and differences in normal behavior showing when an object passed through the sky at a certain time. In the data collected, it showed that around 10-11PM was when there were more differences in the normal behavior. It is hard to determine at this point what those anomalies were, but they can be determined with later research.

ADIABATIC QUANTUM EVOLUTION FOR NP-COMPLETE AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS
Yale Wang Fan
The Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR

Quantum computers are an exciting prospective technology that could provide exponential savings in time and space over classical computers for various problems in NP. This work demonstrates a highly improved model of adiabatic quantum evolution, a method of solving optimization problems proposed by Farhi et al. of MIT. Recent theoretical work has only studied the performance of simple linear adiabatic evolution on random ensembles of NP-complete problems. However, we show numerically that a nonlinear adiabatic path can greatly decrease the time complexity of the algorithm when applied to random hard instances of NP-complete problems, which suggests that the nonlinear adiabatic quantum algorithm can outperform classical algorithms on such ensembles. We also generalize the work of Farhi et al. to describe several new classes of Boolean satisfiability problems for which the adiabatic quantum algorithm always runs in polynomial time, thus contributing to a theoretical understanding of the power of adiabatic quantum computers. Finally, we investigate the implications of problems that are efficiently solvable via adiabatic evolution for lattice models in quantum statistical mechanics. Our work thus proposes new directions for the development and application of quantum computers while demonstrating a method to greatly improve their capabilities.

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF VISCOSITY USING STOKES' LAW: EXAMINING AND CORRECTING STOKES' LAW'S LIMITATIONS IN VISCOMETRY
Katrina Lynn Hui
Richland High School, Richland, WA

The objectives are to apply Stokes’ law to understand factors influencing the movement of a sphere in a viscous fluid, and to determine the fluid viscosity. The method of a free-falling sphere in a fluid in a cylindrical column viscometer was used to measure the terminal velocities, from which the fluid viscosity was calculated. However, Stokes’ law only applies to laminar flow in an infinite medium, so the experiment presents three challenges. First, the Reynolds numbers for all measurements are verified to be smaller than one (Re < 1), ensuring laminar flow and applicability of Stokes’ law. Second, the terminal velocities were confirmed to have been reached before measurements were taken. Third, the wall effect was found to be significant and strongly dependent on the ratio of the sphere and cylinder diameters. The results show that, if uncorrected, the viscosity can be overestimated by as much as 2.5 times for a sphere relatively large compared to the cylinder. Even using a small sphere and a large cylinder can only reduce, but not eliminate, the wall effect. By using spheres of six different diameters and cylinders of four different diameters, twenty-four sets of measurements were taken to provide sufficient data for detailed analysis. After correcting for the wall effect, the viscosity of corn syrup at 68°F was determined to be 3.16±0.04 Pa-s, which agrees well with reported values. To conclude, it was demonstrated that Stokes’ law can be applied to determine the fluid viscosity after correcting for the wall effect.

ASSESSING CHANGES IN COLLAGEN LEVELS OF PROSTATE TISSUE FROM CASTRATED RATS USING NON-LINEAR OPTICS
Bruna Favetta
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

The simultaneous detection of nonlinear optical processes, such as higher harmonic generation and multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, has increasing biological applications. While second harmonic generation (SHG) is detected in areas with lack of symmetry, two photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) is usually induced using fluorophores. <br><br>In this study, SHG and TPEF imaging were performed to characterize differences in amount of collagen in the extracellular matrix of prostate tissue after castration (hormonal ablation). If collagen has a noncentrosymmetric shape possessing high nonlinear susceptibility, and is present in the stroma (connective tissue-extracellular matrix) of prostate tissue, then the intensity of second harmonic generation detected will be directly proportional to the amount of collagen present. This research utilized femtosecond laser pulses (791nm) for excitation of rat prostate tissue slides from groups (n=3) of animals that had been castrated and sacrificed 7, 14, and 21 days after surgery, for a purpose other than this research. The tissue samples were also stained with DAPI and eosin, inducing two photon fluorescence in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cells.<br><br>The results show little or no collagen fibers present in the extracellular matrix of control noncastrated rats. Increasing intensity of SHG reveals a progressive accumulation of collagen around the cells (stained) of the prostate tissue after castration. These results suggest that the hormonal ablation caused by castration directly influences up regulation of collagen production and, therefore, prostate physiology and function, relevant in discussions of the effects of hormonal therapies on prostatic diseases. Moreover, nonlinear optics were successfully employed to display the biological link between hormonal ablation and collagen production.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF RELATIVE DRAG ON SONIC SLED VELOCITY
Alexander Matthew Atkinson
Oakton High School, Vienna VA, VA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine the effect of relative forward to reverse drag coefficients on the velocity of a sonic sled. By having large differences in forward & reverse drag coefficients, an object may be propelled in a low frequency sound field. It is likely that sleds with larger differences between drag coefficients will result in greater velocity. Four conical sleds of varying drag coefficients will be measured for velocity in a uniform sound field to determine this relationship. The experiment began by creating four sonic sleds of equal diameter, weight, & varying cone angle. Once they were created, weight was added to all the sleds until they were equal. After that, the sleds were placed in the pressure field & were tested for the velocity using an audio detector & a photo interrupter circuit. After the velocities were recorded, the mean and variance of them was calculated. The results came out as expected, the sled with the largest difference between the air drag coefficients had the greatest velocity and the sled with the most similar, had the slowest velocity. In conclusion, I conclude that lift may be achieved in a sonic sound field by use of an asymmetrical drag object having greater drag in the upward direction. I conclude that the velocity of such an object increases as the difference between upward and downward drag increases. I conclude that the velocity of such an object is constant as it reaches terminal velocity between mass, drag, and sonic lift.

ASSESSING THE SBOS METHOD OF IDENTIFYING T TAURI STARS
Inga Saathoff
Oil City Area Senior High School, Oil City, PA

Understanding the nature of T Tauri stars is essential to understanding the evolutionary path of our own solar system. SBOS (Spuck-Butchart-Optical Survey Method) is a simplified method of identifying T Tauri stars using small-scale optical telescopes. However, to date the method has only been used in an attempt to distinguish T Tauri stars from standard stars. AGN and active M dwarf stars emit excess in both infrared and Hα, similar to T Tauri stars, making it likely that objects such as these may contaminate any T Tauri selection. This study uses observations from the Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9 Meter Telescope to further investigate the SBOS method and its true identification efficiency. The results of this study indicate that the initial efficiency claim of 70% is incorrect. Due to potential contamination by active M dwarf stars, the true efficiency is closer to 48%. However, additional observations in CaII and U may be able to be used to separate active M dwarf stars from T Tauri stars, bringing the efficiency back up to near 70%. The study demonstrates that while identification efficiency is significantly lower than initially thought, the SBOS method shows great promise for both professional and amateur astronomers identifying these Young Stellar Objects. A fast inexpensive all-sky survey could now be conducted generating a large catalog of potential T Tauri stars for follow-up observations, and to initiate a citizen science monitoring project by the amateur community.

REDUCING THE COMPUTATION TIME OF A N-BODY GALACTIC SIMULATION
Evan Haley Fletcher
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

This project is an investigation into methods for reducing computation time of a galactic interaction simulation without sacrificing structural accuracy. The intent is to allow researchers to perform large simulations on systems more readily available than supercomputers. It was found that elimination of all calculations between luminous masses (with compensation for said lost mass) generated a 98% reduction in computation time while maintaining the most accuracy of all other methods tested.<br><br>A basic, brute-force simulation was implemented; this (control) simulation includes a dark matter halo determined by the Einasto Profile, and treats luminous mass as small spheres governed by Shell Theorem. This approach reduces certain inaccuracies generated by point-mass methods and can better represent a galactic disk.<br><br>An evaluative program, which computes differences in Gaussian convolutions between simulations, was written to enable objective numeric comparison of vague structure between the tested methods and the control simulation. <br><br>Modifications were made to the control simulation with the intent of reducing computation time while maintaining accuracy; the computation time of each modified version was recorded, along with the difference values reported by the evaluative program. <br><br>It was found that a spherical approximation of luminous mass, coupled with a dark matter halo, produces the most accurate result of all tested variations and results in a computation time of 368.51s (as compared to the control 19 927.33s).

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
Christopher Micheal Heintz
West Geauga High School, Chesterland, OH

Electromagnetism is extremely important to our world today. Without it, we would not have electricity. This experiment uses electricity to create an exceedingly strong magnetic field to launch an aluminum disk into the high air to demonstrate Electromagnetic Induction. The aluminum disk was placed on a coil of wire through which a pulse of electric current was passed, and its velocity measured. Variables such as disk material, thickness “dead weight” loading, and temperature were also considered. My hypothesis was that the kinetic energy would vary linearly with input energy. It was proven wrong; the process of induction becomes more efficient as input energy increases. This shows fewer, more intense pulses can be used to increase the efficiency of induction motors and transformers. This translates to a lower duty cycle with more energetic pulses. Both of these methods of increasing efficiency increase wear on the electrical system and motor, so a compromise must be reached to balance increased maintenance costs and energy savings.

THE FIRST ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS AND DETERMINATION OF RELATED PROPERTIES FOR RADIUM
Aryan Iden Khojandi
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

I employed the Density Functional Theory of Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham using a self-consistent, scalar-relativistic approach to conduct novel, self-consistent electronic structure calculations for the heavy element Radium. The calculations using the LAPW GGA method with a sufficiently dense k-point mesh produced results for the ground-state structure and equilibrium lattice parameter in excellent agreement with experiment, whereas the MT-APW and LAPW LDA methods found the incorrect ground-state structure and underestimated the equilibrium lattice parameter. I also calculated the elastic constants and related moduli in order to explore the mechanical properties of Radium. I further investigated the DOS and band structure of both bcc and fcc radium, at ambient conditions, in the expanded lattice, and under high pressure, and found results similar to those found for other Alkaline Earth metals with the corresponding structures as their ground states. Additionally, I used the total-energy and enthalpy results to predict a phase transition from bcc to fcc at a pressure of about 2.0 GPa. I then employed McMillan's theory of superconductivity, discovering increased superconducting properties for both structures under pressure and a superconductivity transition temperature of about 10 K for the fcc structure under a pressure of 16.3 GPa. The methods applied may now be used to conduct similar calculations for other materials.

Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

Imagine a spacecraft that could autonomously explore the solar system for decades. It would calculate its own route and not need to be refueled. This project investigates how such a craft could be created.<br><br> <br><br>Such a spacecraft is possible using the posited Interplanetary Superhighway, the collection of low-energy orbits that would provide fuel-less transport for spacecraft throughout the solar system. Low-energy space travel is similar in many ways to the first explorers traveling the oceans. Sailing ships use winds and currents, natural energy sources on Earth, to travel our oceans. In the same way, spacecraft can use the gravity and movement of planets, natural energy sources in space, to travel our solar system. These paths are referred to as low-energy orbits.<br><br> <br><br>While scientists agree that this ‘sailing ship of the solar system’ is theoretically possible, actually describing how it would work has proved to be a challenge. Low-energy orbits that reach other planets seem to take prohibitively long amounts of time to fly and are extremely complicated to plan. This project seeks to find efficient types of low-energy orbits and determine how a spacecraft would fly them.<br><br> <br><br>A prototype software system has been developed that would allow a spacecraft to autonomously calculate and fly low-energy orbits. Results show that a spacecraft could use minute propulsion capabilities to reach other planets far more quickly than previously thought using a low-energy orbit. This research may represent a practical step forward, transforming the Interplanetary Superhighway from theory to a practical method for space exploration.

CLOCKWORK IN M1
Travis Nathaniel Crockett
V. Sue Cleveland High School, Rio Rancho, NM

An important aspect of astronomy is detecting and imaging faint objects in space, particularly dynamic or periodic behaviors. The near term objective of this research was to develop realistic techniques to redetect the optical pulsar in the Crab Nebula (M1), using a small telescope aperture, a photon counting detector, and signal processing algorithms. The far term objective is to apply these techniques to national concerns with space debris in low earth orbit. The two main issues were the low pulsar signal and the high noisy nebular background that surrounds it. Synchronous detection should coherently fold (coadd) pulses into a strong signal and, simultaneously, average down background noise. Digital logic must precisely match the pulsar’s temporal shape to 80 time bins, which accumulate the photon events. <br><br> Through simulation, the required integration time and limiting phase error were determined. A pulsed laser and integrating sphere were used in the laboratory to demonstrate the end-to-end synchronous detection technique. Field data taken against the Crab Pulsar showed both the primary pulse and the interpulse (i.e., the smaller secondary pulse) profiles. The detailed pulse waveform was difficult to discern, due in part to low signal levels. Statistical analysis indicated the data must have originated from the Crab Pulsar, with a likelihood of better than 99.999999%. The full measured period agrees with the Doppler shifted published value to within 20 nanoseconds. Therefore, against very dim and periodic objects, like the Crab Pulsar, the technique developed here should provide a powerful detection and accurate measurement capability.

DETECTING COSMIC RAYS IN YOUR GARAGE
Matthew Russell Eskridge
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

This project's goal was to construct a home-made Drift Chamber using easy acquirable materials and compare results with those of a purchased Geiger counter. The main references for this project were found in a Scientific American article from the February 2001 edition which goes into detail on how to make a muon detector at home. This Drift Chamber/Geiger counter consists of three plates within a low pressure gas. The center plate of fine grid wires was connected to a high voltage power source and the outer plates were connected to ground. Muons passing through the assembly were detected by a digital oscilloscope and a computer processor. The average pulses per second were recorded and compared to results from a Radalert Geiger counter.<br><br>The home-built drift chamber was found to be approximately 33% more sensitive than the professional design, likely a result of the substantially higher voltages used detecting weaker particles. The purchased counter had an average counts per minute (CPM) of 14 in the test area and the chamber an output of 2541 CPM on average. When correcting the CPM to account for the size difference it is close to 21 CPM. This seems to imply a correlation between the results given by the commercial detector and drift chamber, not a static electric connection. Counts increased when uranium ore was introduced. In conclusion, it is possible to build a Geiger counter in your own garage, as long as you are willing to deal with high voltages and low pressures.

EVALUATION OF ASTROMETRY AS A TOOL FOR FINDING EXOPLANETS
Joseph Steven Mangelsen
Southside High School, Greenville, SC

Astrometry, or “measurement of the stars”, has historically proven to be an unsuccessful technique for discovering exoplanets. This project's primary objective was to present the viability of the astrometric technique as a means of detecting exoplanets the size of Earth orbiting their parent stars at distances of up to one astronomical unit. The technique is evaluated through the use of a program written in java. The program, written using Newtonian mechanics, models the effects of an exoplanet’s gravity on a parent star’s position with respect to time. The program consists primarily of a large iterative loop that recalculates new values for the position of a hypothetical star as a result of the gravity of a companion planet for time increments of one hour. The results, analyzed graphically, indicated that a level of measurement on the order of single micoarcseconds will be required of astrometric observatories to be of significant use for detecting Earth-sized exoplanets at distances of one AU from their stars within a radius of approximately 20 light-years of the observer. Results furthermore indicated that sub-microarcsecond astrometry will be required to detect such planets at a distances of more than 20 light-years from the observer. While an analysis of current technology indicates that this level of accuracy does not yet exist, the necessary resolution may likely be achieved within the next dozen years. It is concluded that astrometry will be a viable technique for detecting Earth-sized exoplanets in the near future.

EFFICIENCY OF THERMOELECTRIC POWER CONVERSION IN BI2TE3
Daniela Jane Flax
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

The purpose of this project was to determine the efficiencies of thermoelectric conversion of heating power to electrical power (Ke), heating power to Peltier cooling (Kp) and heating power to cooling power (Kc) and investigate their dependence on the temperature gradient between the two sides of the thermoelectric generator. <br><br>Two experiments were made. In both, the investigated Bismuth Telluride modules were placed between a cooler and a heater. The heater’s open sides were thermo-insulated so the whole heater power went to the module. The first experiment consisted of measuring the entering heat and the electric power generated by the module at different temperature gradients. The second one, devoted to measuring absorbed Peltier heat, was based on heating the cooling (by Peltier effect) side of the module to a temperature equal to that of its heating side. <br><br>It was found that Ke in the investigated modules had an approximately linear dependence on the temperature gradient and did not exceed 4%. Kp was significantly higher than Ke and didn’t vary significantly with the temperature gradient. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients, as well as thermal conductivity, of the investigated modules were calculated and used to estimate the cooling efficiency of systems consisting of one cooler connected to a group of thermoelectric generators. It was found that Kc of these systems did not exceed 5%.<br><br>Investigated thermoelectric modules can be used for the conversion of heat (including solar energy or waste heat in cars) to cooling or electrical power, but only in a limited number of cases. The efficiency can be increased by the development of thermoelectric modules withstanding higher temperatures, having lower thermal conductivity and/or higher Seebeck coefficients.

STUDY OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES FOR NANOCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS
Daniel Neimark
Religious Comprehensive "AMIT" High School, Beer Sheva, ISRAEL

The properties of ferromagnetic materials in form of nanocrystals embedded in a matrix of a ribbon amorphous metal were studied in this project.<br><br>Ferromagnetic materials are used in many practical applications such as electronics and communications devices. However soft ferromagnetic materials are required for electrical energy transfer. This property is needed to reduce the energy losses in large transformer. <br><br>There are several well known ferromagnetic materials such as steel and amorphous metals.However a new class of nanocrystalline ferromagnetic metals, was discovered in Japan in 1988.<br><br>In this project a sample of ferromagnetic nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous metal was prepared. The magnetic properties, such as magnetic hysteresis at different frequencies, saturated magnetic field intensity, overmagnetization and energy losses in magnetization processes, of these materials were studied. These properties were compared with those of the amorphous metal.The hysteresis loop area of these new material was found to be smaller by an order of magnitude than that of the bare ferromagnetic metals. Thus suggesting a very low energy losses of these new materials.

FISSION VISION: THE DETECTION OF PROMPT AND DELAYED INDUCED FISSION GAMMA RADIATION, AND THE APPLICATION TO THE DETECTION OF PROLIFERATED NUCLEAR MATERIALS
Taylor Ramon Wilson
The Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

A research project was undertaken to explore the feasibilty of using neutron induced fission in Special Nuclear Material (SNM) in the detection of proliferated nuclear material and devices. A detection scheme developed in which a suspected cargo container is irradiated with a low intensity 2.5 MeV neutron flux, and the resultant gamma ray spectrum is collected, both for prompt and delayed fission products in a region of little background of greater than 3 MeV The detection of explosives is also feasible with the detection scheme via the detection of the 10.8 MeV prompt Nitrogen gamma photon. Different detectors were explored, including HPGe, NaI(Tl), and BGO (Bismuth Germanate), and while BGO offered the lowest resolution of the three detectors, the density of the scintillator material allowed for the detection of the higher energy gammas, including that of Nitrogen. The data suggests that the detection of gammas rejected from the background is feasible, and that the system represents a reliable way to detect explosives and SNM.

FINDING THE MINIMUM ENERGY CONFORMATION OF PROTEIN-LIKE HETEROPOLYMERS BY GREEDY NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH
Joon Suk Huh
Home School, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, SOUTH KOREA

A global optimization method called Greedy Neighborhood Search (GNS) and a novel conformational sampling method using a spherical distribution is proposed to find the minimum energy conformation of a protein-like heteropolymer model called AB model. The AB model consists of hydrophobic (A) and hydrophilic (B) monomers analogous to the real proteins. The AB model in three-dimensional space is represented by simple bead-rod chain system which is identical to the one-bead protein model. The minimum energy conformations of four different sequences consisting of 13, 21, 34, and 55 monomers are obtained by the GNS method. The minimum energies found are lower than those obtained by other methods. Also the minimum energy conformations found have a similarity with the real proteins forming a single hydrophobic core.

AN IMPROVED METRIC FOR VISUAL DIFFERENTIATION USING COLOUR-MODIFIED CLINICAL EYE CHARTS
Jonathan David Sapolinski
Redeemer Baptist School, North Paramatta, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA

According to World Health Organisation reports (2009), an estimated 314 million people are vision impaired worldwide. The majority also suffer some form of colour discrimination impairment, making it preferable to distinguish boundaries of adjacent objects using differences in luminance rather than contrasting colours. Hence, building regulations stipulate minimum luminance contrast levels for features such as doors and stairways, giving the vision impaired equal access to public facilities. With luminance contrast standards differing from country to country, an international standard is being developed.<br><br> <br><br> This study quantifies how the human eye perceives differences in adjacent matt colours with the primary aim of recommending a universal metric for luminance contrast. 48 unique, A0-sized colour-modified clinical ETDRS eye charts were produced with the purpose of using visual acuity as a representative measure for visually differentiating colours. A logarithmic trend was identified, comparing the average visual acuity score of 80 subjects (66 normal vision, 14 vision impaired) and the luminance contrast between font and background colours for each chart. <br><br> <br><br> Using collected data, the three recognised national standard equations for luminance contrast were compared and modifications were made to the statistically optimum equation, improving the correlation value from 0.8270 to 0.9257. The new metric for luminance contrast developed, resolves the shortcomings of the previous equations in relation to two adjacent dark surfaces.

GAPRITE - A SIMPLE METHOD FOR SETTING SAFE GAPS BETWEEN VEHICLES WHEN DRIVING
Harry Ned Anderson
Lyneham High School, Lyneham, ACT, ACT, AUSTRALIA

Rear-end collisions are a major cause of accidents in Australia and worldwide, costing billions of dollars in repairs, and thousands of injuries and deaths annually. Most rear-end collisions occur because drivers travel too close to the car ahead (‘tail-gating’). The safe gap between vehicles is equal to the distance travelled in either 2 or 3 seconds for the speed. To demonstrate the problem, gap distances maintained by drivers in Canberra, Australia, when travelling at various speeds from 40-100 kph, were estimated from photographs. The results showed that drivers maintained an average gap distance of about 25 m, regardless of speed. This 25 m gap is only safe for speeds less than 40 kph. Clearly, the methods drivers currently use to set safe gaps are not working, or drivers are unaware of the dangers. GapRite stickers for the 2 and 3 second gap distances were designed to be attached to the top inner surface of the windshield in front of the driver, or to the inner side of the sun visor. Each image on the sticker, for the designated speed, matches the size that a car ahead would appear to the driver at the safe gap distance. Drivers simply adjust the gap distance so that the width of the car ahead, as it appears to the driver, matches the width of the image for the speed the car is travelling. GapRite stickers are simpler, safer, more effective and easier to use than existing methods, and could greatly reduce rear-end collisions worldwide.

POINT OF IMPACT
James Luke South
Tishomingo County High School, Luka, MS

This project is meant to quantify the relation between a bullet’s trajectory and the bore line using the laws of physics and math proofs. The knowledge of that relationship allows a mathematical way of adjusting the impact of a bullet.<br><br> The gun was vised and the barrel leveled. Target boards were setup in line with the barrel at 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 45, and 50 meters from the muzzle. Those at 10, 30, and 50 meters were marked using the laser and targets were hung on them. The other target boards served as a reference point to place the chronograph. The chronograph was placed at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 meters in chronological order. Ten shots were fired recording the velocity of each with the chronograph at each distance. Once this was completed, fifty shots were fired in each of the targets. Then the barrel was angled to 0.5 degrees below horizontal. Fifty more shots were fired into the targets but no more velocities were measured. Following this, the barrel was angled to 0.5 degrees above horizontal. Fifty more shots were fired into the targets.<br><br> The data showed a slightly higher bullet drop at .5 degrees compared to the other angles. The bullet drop at 0 and .5 degrees was essentially the same. Also theoretical trajectory showed the same bullet drop for the different angles.<br><br> The hypothesis was proven incorrect. The change in angle does not affect the bullet’s drop in relation to the bore line.

THE EFFICIENCY OF A SMALL PARTICLE ACCELERATOR AT IRRADIATING VARIOUS TARGETS AND PRODUCING RADIATION
Adam Joseph Bowman
Montgomery Bell Academy, Nashville, TN

Particle accelerators have multiple uses from particle physics to manufacturing. However, their high cost and technical complexity places them out of reach for many facilities. This project involved designing, building, and testing the capabilities of a small, low-cost linear particle accelerator. <br><br> The accelerator was used to perform multiple tests accelerating electrons, alpha particles, or atmospheric ions at different targets. The radiation emitted by the targets was detected and recorded by a Geiger counter. For all tests, accelerating potential, vacuum level, and the testing environment were closely controlled. Many safety precautions, such as proper vacuum procedure and a lead radiation shield were used while testing. <br><br> The radiation emitted during these tests consisted of high energy photons (X-Rays) and beta radiation. The results showed that when accelerating electrons, the targets of greater atomic number emitted more radiation than those of lower atomic number. These results are to be expected, and they show that the accelerator is capable of producing accurate results. When using a copper target, it was found that alpha particles produced more radiation than electrons or atmospheric ions due to their intermediate mass. When using alpha particles (helium nuclei) to bombard a beryllium target, neutrons were produced through the nuclear fusion of the helium and beryllium nuclei to form carbon-12. <br><br> Overall, a small linear accelerator can perform well, effectively bombard targets, and produce multiple forms of radiation. A similar or improved design could be utilized to provide an inexpensive, effective accelerator for educational or research applications.

PASCAL´S PRINCIPLE APPLIED TO A FOOTBRIDGE FOR THE DISABLED
Erick Esteban Lara Pacheco
Centro Escolar Zama, Estado de México, Coacalco, MEXICO

The main goal of our project is the development of technology through the construction of elevators that function with the principle of Pascal which will benefit to a sector of the population as they are the people with different capacities, disabled and embarrassed women. Currently we are working on improving the project creating an automatic doors opening system, through a derivation of the air pressure from the elevator drive, thus saving on the energy used by the compressor, which supplies the air pressure required for the elevator system. Also we performed tests to have a speed control on the ascent and descent, regardless of the weight of the elevator through the use of valves and sensors. In order to avoid accidents and as security systems there will be placed metal bars or concrete containment to protect the surroundings of the elevator on the ground, and the car will descent by gravity when there is a power outage. We also calculated the work and power which will be used in the elevator related to the weight and height as in a pedestrian bridge which can be found at several intersections in our community. As a result from our research, this project is considered feasible and will help people with disabilities or others in a temporary inability, granting them freedom of movement as well as creating social consciousness in our community.<br><br>elevator, we will save electrical energy.<br><br>Also we calculated the electrical energy and the power of the pressure´s elevator that will use, in comparison at a conventional elevator.<br><br>We calculated in based a hight of six meters, and in based the results that we obtained we prove that if we applied pressure in the elevator, we will save electrical energy.

FOR THE LOVE OF TENNIS
Dannie Lynn Fountain
Saint Clair High School, St. Clair, MI

The history of tennis dates back several thousand years, but the idea of the importance of the tennis ball is a relatively new one. Tennis has always been about the technique and the honor behind the game, but recent events have brought the tennis ball’s importance to a new light. Air pressure, air temperature, and humidity truly have an effect on the way a tennis ball bounces. High pressures, high humidity, and cold temperatures will keep a ball from bouncing to its maximum potential. To help curb this problem, different balls are produced to deal with the different variables in play. Certain balls are made for play below 1,219 feet above sea level, while others are made for play above that marker. Some officials swear by the fact that these balls are perfectly designed for their designated locations. My research proves otherwise. I tested six varying tennis balls at different temperatures, pressures, and humidity levels. I left the balls out for a 24-hour period prior to testing so that they could become acclimated to the temperature and conditions, as suggested by the International Tennis Federation. I recorded the weather conditions as cited by http://www.wunderground.com (an aeronautical weather guide), including UV rays, pressures, wind speed, temperatures, and cloud coverage. I then bounced each ball 30 times in succession during each weather condition. The heights of each bounce were recorded in centimeters and then the percent of energy lost in each bounce was calculated using the formula [(180-n)/180]. My results truly surprised me. The balls bounced in a rather consistent manner, regardless of their specified pressures and temperatures or manufacturer specification.

DEVELOPMENT OF A RESONANT OPTICAL CAVITY SIMULATION
Moyukh Chatterjee
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

Thin-film solar cells, while cheaper than traditional photovoltaic cells, are less efficient. Therefore, any method that improves their absorption range will make them more marketable. This study used a Matlab simulation to model resonant optical cavity systems. The modeled systems can improve thin-film efficiency by augmenting the absorbance spectrum of these layers. The system to be modeled consisted of a cavity layer surrounded by two one-dimensional photonic crystals, which trapped and amplified light in the cavity. The simulation aims to determine which wavelengths create standing modes in the cavity, working from the following system parameters: layer indices of refraction, number of layers, layer thicknesses, and initial electric field amplitude. The simulation used a set of matrix transformations derived from Maxwell's equations to relate input electromagnetic fields to output electromagnetic fields, and then used these fields to determine the maximal electric field displacements inside of the cavity. Absorption layers should ideally be placed wherever the electric field has maximum amplitude, as the electric field at these points generates maximum current in thin-film layers. The simulation has been able to successfully model such resonant cavity systems, correctly predicting confinement of electromagnetic waves and their subsequent amplification inside the cavity.

A COMPARISON OF SIMILAR PLANETARY SYSTEMS OF WASP-2
Travis Le
Punahou School, Honolulu, HI

The star, WASP-2, has only one known planet, which transits its parent star. Since last year's research suggested that WASP-2 actually has more than one planet, this year, a comparison of similar planetary systems of WASP-2 was conducted to determine whether this type of system had a higher chance of having more than one planet. If there is only one planet, then all midpoint transit times should fall within the ephemeris of midpoints. Detection of transit timing variations would suggest the existence of additional planets.<br><br> WASP-2, TrES-2, HAT-P-5, and HD189733 were observed at least four times during an eight-month period. For each transit, one of two methods was used to analyze the data. The first method performed photometry on images taken from remote telescopes and computed the target star's relative flux. The second method used online data and converted it into instrumental units. For all systems, the experimental midpoint time generally did not cross the ephemeris of midpoints. For example, for the TrES-2 transit of 9/2/09, in HJD, the theoretical midpoint time was 2455076.8210, but the experimental midpoint time was 2455076.8226±0.0011. Through analysis, the data suggests that HAT-P-5's phase is miscalculated and that WASP-2, TrES-2, and HD189733 have multiple planets, thus suggesting that this type of system has a higher chance of having more than one planet. Currently, a test is being developed from these results, needing only two consecutive transits to determine if a system has more than one planet, ideally making many discoveries in significantly shorter time.

MAGNETS VS. TEMPERATURE
George Daniel Messersmith
Lakeside Junior High School, Hot Springs, AR

The purpose of this project is to determine if temperature affects magnetic strength. The experiment took place from an interest with magnets. The hypothesis of this experiment is setting magnets at hot or cold temperatures will weaken its magnetic strength compared to a magnet set at room temperature.<br><br> <br><br> The investigation was conducted by heating a magnet to 98°C and another magnet to -18°C. The magnet is the control, and it remains at room temperature. After getting the magnets to the appropriate temperatures for one hour, a screw was attached to the end of the magnets, so temperature would not be altered. The magnets were dipped in a bowl of BB pellets, and count of how many pellets each picked up. This process was completed for five trials. <br><br> The experiment showed that temperature does affect the strength of magnets. The heated magnet picked up an average of 216 pellets in five trials. The cooled magnet picked up an average of 236 pellets, while the control magnet picked up an average of 271 pellets. The data shows that temperature weakens magnetic strength.<br><br> The experimentation revealed that cold and hot temperatures do weaken a magnet’s strength. However, hot temperatures weaken the magnet the most. There was a thirty-five pellet difference between the cooled and control magnets, while a fifty-five pellet difference between the average of the heated and control magnets. It can be concluded that a magnet is strongest at room temperature.

HIDDEN SOUNDS: HARMONIC SYMMETRY OF HUMAN VOICES (CONTINUATION YEAR 2)
Ellen Marie Price
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

Many people rely on voice synthesis technology to communicate and learn. The question in this experiment was, "Do human voices exhibit similar harmonic patterns that may be integrated into voice synthesis technology?" The hypothesis was that human voices share common harmonic ratios that give them a unique and characteristic sound.<br><br> Ten volunteers were asked to read a script slowly and clearly into a microphone while the audio was recorded. Each voice sample was broken into twenty single sounds, which were analyzed using a Fast Fourier Transform. Using this data, harmonic profiles for each of the two hundred recordings were generated and compared with an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA supported the hypothesis that all data was collected from the same population, or that the means of all of the data were equal.<br><br> Next, a similar procedure was used to evaluate the difference in harmonic ratios of the human voice and a synthesized voice; the hypothesis was that this difference was statistically significant. Synthesized voice samples were evaluated with the Fast Fourier Transform and a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The individual sounds were found to be significantly different, but the means were statistically the same.<br><br> Finally, voice samples were collected through a cellular phone system to determine the statistical difference between the natural voice and the electronically processed voice. The Fast Fourier Transform and chi-square goodness-of-fit test were once again employed in the analysis. Once again, the individual sounds were found to be significantly different, but the means were statistically equal.

STEALTH SCIENCE: DOES SURFACE AREA AND ANGLE MEASURE OF A 3-D OBJECT AFFECT THE SCATTERING OF VISIBLE LIGHT AS MEASURED BY A LUX METER MAKING THE OBJECT MORE OR LESS STEALTHY?
Eric Alexander Riehl
Westminster Christian School, Palmetto Bay, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to find how angle measure and surface area affect the scattering of visible light that is reflected from different objects. Since visible light is an electromagnetic wave, the results of this experiment can be correlated to the effect of radar waves on aircraft, specifically the development of stealth technology. Two tests were performed: one for angle measure and one for surface area. The hypothesis is that the object with the smallest surface area and largest angle measure will return the least amount of light.<br><br>All tests were performed inside a black box where objects were placed upright against a light source and the light reflected was measured by a lux meter. On the first test, three different surface areas were tested. The second test measured the reflected incident light beam based on the design’s angle measures. <br><br>The square with the least surface area and the object with the largest angle measure (the flat surface) returned the least amount of light. This means larger angles will dissipate and scatter the most amount of visible light away from the receiver. A stealthy aircraft can be improved if more angles with a greater measure are added, so that more of the radar waves will be scattered.

SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS: A NEW WAY FOR DETERMINING ATMOSPHERIC DENSITIES
Cayley Erin Dymond
North Point High School for Science, Technology, and Industry, Waldorf, MD

The purpose of this project was to test the validity of the hypothesis: if a satellite constellation with very accurate and precise position and velocity measurements exists, then it can be used to determine the relative air density at those satellite altitudes. Using the COSMIC/ FORMOSAT-3 constellation of six identical satellites and their orbit data, satellite positions, and velocities, the relative atmospheric density was calculated using the approach described by the Naval Research Laboratory. Programs were written using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) to read, manipulate, and analyze the data. The calculated atmospheric densities were compared to the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (MSIS) model to determine the correlation of the two data sets. The results showed the hypothesis was valid because the data from the calculated drag densities had very similar trends to the MSIS results. The correlation coefficients of data sets for each satellite indicate a high degree of correlation between the MSIS and calculated drag densities (with the exception of satellite 3): satellite 1 = 0.58, satellite 2 = 0.73, satellite 3 = 0.03, satellite 4 = 0.69, satellite 5 = 0.81, and satellite 6 = 0.58 and the closer to 1, the better the correlation. Also, the density values determined for satellites at the same altitudes (satellites 1 and 3; satellites 2, 4, 5, and 6) agreed with each other, indicating consistency of the drag analysis. Therefore, this project demonstrated the utility of using satellite constellations as a new tool for determining atmospheric densities.

Anugraha Rajendran
Tualatin High School, Tualatin, OR

Aim: To invent transformations that will simplify arbitrary quantum circuits by using new hybrid technology. Also, the aim is to clearly explain the basics of quantum technology. Method: I will explore the implications of hybrid logic for 5 bit, 6 bit, and 7 bit Toffoli gates. I will also explore this new logic in other fundamental gates, such as Fredkin, Feynman, SWAP, etc. Then, by investigating possible local reductions of these new quantum circuits, I will invent transformations that will simplify arbitrary quantum circuits by using this hybrid technology. The reduction of resources and costs can then be observed by comparing the new circuits to the old circuits. Results/Conclusion: The use of hybrid logic proves to show that more effective and cheaper gates can be created. This could be a great step in a different direction to one day creating a quantum computer.

A THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE REFLECTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES FROM TWO REFLECTION TYPE DIFFRACTION GRATINGS
Sourav Sarkar
Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur, Kolkata, INDIA

My project presents a theoretical study of the effects of superposition of electromagnetic waves, perfectly reflected from two reflection type diffraction gratings, in the far-field (incident wave being plane and source being coherent). Such mathematical and computational analysis might reveal interesting features relevant to the practical use of the gratings or just an interesting observation. <br><br>Grating-1 has a rectangular groove profile, while grating-2 is of blazed type. The amplitude and hence the intensity distribution were derived as a function of an angular variable (H) and wavelength to a size parameter ratio (W), with the number of grating elements 5,10,15,20. I observed that the 2D amplitude distribution of grating-1 is not a product of individual 1D profiles along both directions, due to the interdependent initial phase variation along the two directions. Special cases of normal incidence, equal elevation and depression width, reduction to a flat reflector, were studied for grating-1. The possibility of blazing grating-2 at more than one wavelength was investigated. <br><br>Grating-1 showed intense side bands in the range W=0.01 to 0.1. Below 0.001 the intensity approached a delta function, while very interestingly, above 1.0 the intensity varied smoothly over a large angular space. A relation between grating profile periodicity and the missing orders has been found. This is practically significant as it gives control over the free spectral range and also permits increased intensity in certain orders. Grating-2 produced standard results up to W=0.5 above which it was similar to grating 1.<br><br>I have also derived a special linear function and an algorithm based on it for grating-1 which gives a qualitative idea about the side bands with a given set of parameters.

INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF "HARD" AND "EASY" AXES IN THE TRANSPARENT MAGNETIC FILMS
Sergiy Lavrentyev
HC "School-lyceum" No. 3 them. Makarenko, Simferopol, Crimea, UKRAINE

Thin films of transparent magnets are widely used in information technology as the elements of data processing and storage devices, integrated optics. Functional parameters of such films are governed by the spatial orientation of the "hard" and "easy" magnetization axes that are usually measured manually with the use of a rather expensive polarizing microscope. <br><br>I propose an innovative method for fast determination of the spatial position of the magnetic axes based on the relation between the Faraday rotation and axes orientations with respect to the fixed external magnetic field. The idea of the method is to rotate the sample placed between two static polarizes in a static magnetic field with the fixed orientation. The intensity of light that goes through the system is modulated depending on the orientation of magnetic axes with respect to magnetic field and then is registered by the oscilloscope. Axes orientation is calculated on the basis of the minima/maxima positions on the oscillogram. The method was tested on the Bi-containing ferrite-garnet films and showed the same accuracy as a standard technique.<br><br> <br><br>My method and installation allows to speed up the process of axes determination to 100 times and to make this process simpler, cheaper and automatized. The installation exploits the cheap and standard elements that are available at any scholar lab. It can be used for the industrial automatic control of the transparent magnetic film with the pronounced magnetoopical properties.

The Sun’s energy, sustain life on Earth in a direct or indirect way. Photosynthesis, food production, the Earth's climate and weather are affected by this energy. This project seeks to present the relationship between solar storms and Earth's climate. The hypothesis was that solar storms increase ionization of the atmosphere that produces alterations in the polar climate which in turn can cause climate changes on Earth. The first step was to find similar patterns between sunspots and arctic oscillations of the geographical North Pole, using the information obtained from GFSx Model Forecasts for a period from 1950-2009 and the information gathered from different Solar Observatories. Both data sets were compared. Patterns are evident for periods of 10 years each. Graphs of sunspot cycles were compared to artic oscillations of the geographical North Pole. These coincide during some decades, reflecting a relationship between high solar activities and drastic changes in atmospheric pressure at the North Pole. Correlation analysis between these two variables was done for two decades. The results show maximum similarity patterns among the data. This data analysis requires further study to find a statistical correlation. There are other dates during which the connection is suspected but was not evident. It is suggested that this behavior is due to the magnetic field direction, which bring the solar storm, by interacting with the magnetosphere. This project seeks to emphasize the importance of analyzing the ionization of the atmosphere upper layers to demonstrate the close relationship between space and our planet.

DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH SPEED FLASH TECHNIQUE FOR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERAS
Ryan Peng
Centennial Collegiate, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CANADA

A technique was developed to allow the use of external flash at shutter speeds higher than the maximum sync speeds of compact digital cameras. A method to use the digital camera image sensor to measure light from flash units was developed by correlating brightness of gray card images with light meter readings. This method is essential to the development of the high speed flash technique because light meters can not accurately measure light in very short time intervals. Using this measurement method, clipped flash output of flash units was measured at several shutter speeds to determine the effects of flash clipping. A mathematical model for the clipped flash output was developed by integrating the flash discharge curve. Using the clipped flash output data, the parameters of the mathematical model were determined. A computer program was created to calculate settings for correct flash exposure by incorporating the mathematical model. Factors affecting exposure such as flash output level, flash zoom, flash distance to subject, ISO rating, aperture f-number, shutter speed, and the flash clipping effect were considered. Trial shots of the gray card were taken to evaluate the accuracy of the computer program. Statistical analysis performed on the trial shots data resulted in an average error of -0.08 stops with a standard deviation of 0.15 stops. The technique developed in this project can be effectively used by both professional photographers and everyday consumers to capture properly exposed pictures and to utilize fill light contrast reduction.

GALAXY IN A BUCKET: UNDERSTANDING SPIRAL GALAXY FORMATION USING A SIMPLE MODELING SYSTEM
Nikita Michael Bogdanov
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

In my research, I studied the formation of spiral galaxies. My goal was to verify a modern theory on galactic formation stating that the spiral structures in some galaxies can be explained by hydrodynamic instabilities.<br><br>In order to model the formation of spirals in galaxies, I built a model to recreate the Kelvin Helmholtz type of instability; this type is believed to be dominant in some spiral galaxies. My model creates a radial velocity drop in a thin layer of modeling fluid, rotated by two spinning discs; mimicking the fast spinning core and slow spinning periphery of a galaxy. A hydrodynamic instability forms due to this velocity drop and creates rotating density waves. In real galaxies, these density waves force stars to clump together to resemble spirals. <br><br>I found that my model was able to create consistently spiral structures with up to four discernible arms. I also found that by varying the magnitude of the velocity drop, I could change the instability pattern and thus vary the number of arms. With a small velocity drop, there were many arms, while with a larger velocity drop, the number of arms was decreased. <br><br>My observations resemble what is seen in real galaxies; I found that the same relation of the velocity drop to the number of arms could be seen in some real galaxies. Thus, my observations are consistent with the theory's predictions. <br><br>In future research, the idea of modeling galactic formation in this way can be applied to more complex systems.

OBSERVING AND MANIPULATING PLASMA IN REGARDS TO ELECTRICAL PHENOMENON
Cornelius Christoffel van Wyk
James. W. Mitchell High School, Trinity, FL

The purpose of the experiment conducted was to observer a free flowing plasma, and manipulate a controlled plasma with magnetic fields in order to observe the effect of an increase in electron concentration on the electrical resistance of a plasma.<br><br> Free moving plasma is created by taking common plasma, fire, and using it as a “seed” to create purer and truer plasma. This is done by exposing to the seed plasma to a radiating energy source, the microwave, which then causes the surrounding gasses, mostly nitrogen, to be excited and converted in to a free body plasma. Since the free moving plasma was created for solely the purpose of observation, there were no quantitative observations made, there was, however, qualitative datum that was recorded. <br><br> The second part of experimentation consisted of taking common controlled plasma, the type found in florescent bulbs, and concentrating the electrons using electromagnets. After setting up the plasma in the fluorescent tube, it is required to make a bank of super magnets that powered by a variable bank of batteries that could produce up to 24 volts DC power for each individual magnet. Calculation is made to the ohms of resistance the control plasma has. After the control measurement was taken, 6 volts of power were supplied to the magnets, measurements taken; this was repeated for 12, 18, and 24 volts.<br><br> Data taken during the experimentation showed that by using a powerful electro magnet the electrical resistance of the plasma could drop up to 25% with the most powerful magnet.<br><br> It was thusly concluded, that when the electron concentration of a plasma increases, then, the resistance of the plasma drops.

THE DILATANT AND IMPACT RESISTANT PROPERTIES OF A CORNSTARCH SUSPENSION
Washington Kumar Nair
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

In our technologically advancing world, the need for effective impact resistant materials is critical. Various materials are being tested in an effort to meet the demand; dilatant suspensions are one of these materials. The present experiment assessed the dilatant properties of tapioca, rice, and corn starch. In initial trials, cornstarch most closely exhibited the properties of an ideal dilatant, and was then used in comparison with polyurethane cushion. The drop-weight method was employed to record impact force and penetration of three steel spheres with varying masses (3.5g, 80.0g, and 324.25g) dropped from heights of 30cm and 60cm onto both materials. The experiment was replicated ten times for each material and height. The lowest average penetration with cornstarch and polyurethane was recorded with the 3.5g sphere dropped from 30cm. Sphere penetration with cornstarch was 0.002m, that of polyurethane was 0.005m. The highest average penetration with cornstarch and polyurethane was recorded with the 324.25g sphere dropped from 60cm. Penetration with cornstarch was 0.007m, that of polyurethane was 0.048m. Impact force was determined using a series of mathematical equations. Results of the experiment indicate that impact force decreased as the penetration increased. Therefore, impact force absorbed by the polyurethane cushion was significantly smaller than that of the cornstarch suspension. Penetration however, was significantly greater with the cushion than with the suspension. Future studies need to be conducted in order to determine whether a composite formed of both materials will exhibit greater properties than the individual materials themselves.

A STUDY OF NANOSTRUCTURED TITANIUM COAT OF CATHODE FOIL BY SPM
Sergey Vyacheslavovich Shpak
GOU Lyceum 1511, Moscow, RUSSIA

The aim was the observation of the unique nanostuctured Ti-coating of cathode foil using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) & the estimation of the increase of foil specific capacity. <br><br>The capacity of condenser is governed by the specific capacity of aluminum foil, used as cathode & anode. The increase of their specific capacity improves electrotechnical properties and minimizes linear dimensions of the capacitor. Etching of aluminum foil for the expansion of the surface area of electrodes is harmful and polluting. New technology is based on the application of nanostuctured Ti-coating on aluminum tape by the method of titanium vacuum electron-beam evaporation in nitrogen atmosphere, which makes the environmentally safe production of cathode foil with a peak specific capacity possible.<br><br>The foil surface with the deposited nanostructured Ti-coating scanning experiments were conducted on a NT-MDT scanning probe microscope - “Nano-educator” whith the use of atomic-force microscopy methods.<br><br>According to the results of scanning-electron microscopy, the suppositional diameter of elementary nanostructured coating unit (grain) is ranged between 20-120 nm.<br><br>During the atomic-force probe of the relief of the sample experiment a porous surface, being an array of clusters of titanium fibers’s ends, implanted in the aluminum surface, was detected. The structure of the coating represents a pack of densely located titanium fibers, which square area of surface widely increase the specific capacity up to 600-2000 mcf/sm².<br><br>The relief tunneling scanning method experiment resulted the same data as in the atomic-force method. The singular clusters or the congestion of titanium fibers’ clusters, characterized by the much more lower graininess, than the main surface of the sample, were detected.

MATHEMATICAL MUSIC

The goal of this experiment was to determine how the overall shape of glass beakers determined the frequency given off when the beaker was struck. It was predicted that those beakers that were wider and taller than their other counterparts would have lower frequencies. It was also predicted that adding water would lower the frequency and denser liquids would further lower the frequency.<br><br>The frequencies of the empty beakers were first recorded for three different tests. Those frequencies were then averaged and the results graphed. From that data, an equation was drawn that would relate frequency of the beaker to the ratio of volume inside to outside diameter to total volume the beaker could hold.<br><br>The tests were continued by selecting three beakers and filling them by percentage of total volume with distilled water and recording the results in a similar fashion to the previous step. One last beaker was tested also with a denser salt water solution.<br><br>The results show signs of an emerging pattern that could be used for predicting frequencies of the beakers. However, the frequencies of beakers filled with water had to be found in individual cases and the results did not follow a simple pattern other than more water lowering the pitch. Also, the denser salt water solution showed slightly lower frequencies, but is still inconclusive.

CAN I VERIFY THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ACCELERATION OF AN OBJECT ROLLING DOWN AN INCLINED PLANE IS IN FACT 9.8 M/S SQUARED?
Samantha Rae Johnson
Lighthouse Christian Academy, Bloomington, IN

For my project, I tested to see if I could prove that acceleration along an inclined plane, after using mathematical equations, was in fact 9.8m/s2. To do this, a took a metal ball and rolled it down and inclined plane at 30deg and 60deg 31 times each, timing each at an interval of 80cm. The first time, I faced the ramp northeast, and the second time, I faced the ramp southwest. After conducting my experiment, I calculated the acceleration along the hypotenuse, and from that I calculated the acceleration due to gravity. Both times my numbers were off, so I had to calculate the significance of error. I also found that the direction in which the ramp faced had little to no effect on how fast the ball rolled. In the end, my hypothesis was not supported and I found out that I could not conclude that the gravitational acceleration along an inclined plane is in fact 9.8m/s2.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF COLOR AND REDSHIFT FOR QUASI-STELLAR RADIO SOURCES
Dylan Cunningham Greaves
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine a regression model that would allow the redshift of a quasar to be accurately estimated based of photometric data. It was hypothesized that first order response curve generated from the SDSS quasar data would have a coefficient of determination greater than .8, allowing for accurate predictions. <br><br>A SQL query to the SDSS database was performed, returning the u, g, r, i, z magnitudes and errors of all quasars with a redshift confidence value greater than .95. The data was organized in a CSV, imported into R, and plotted each astronomical color against redshift. The relations were not in functional form so the range of redshift was restricted to 3.5, and then a first order response curve was generated using the “rsm” package in R. R returned statistical analysis on the response curve, shedding light on the appropriateness of the model. <br><br>The hypothesis was supported as results showed that the first order response curve had an adjusted r2 value of 0.8348. The relationship between astronomical color and redshift proved significant enough to accurately predict redshift based off photometric data for high-redshift quasars.<br><br>

HOW ARE WIND FIELDS DISTURBED?
Nicolas Raul Watkins
Captain John L. Chapin High School, El Paso, TX

Wind turbines are quite large to capture the high winds tens of meters above the ground. To be efficient wind turbines must have minimal impact on the wind fields. An investigation was made into how wind turbine blade spacing affects the wind field. It would be prohibitively expensive to try to perform outdoor measurements on a full-scale wind turbine with uncontrollable wind fields. A small-scale model was designed to perform this investigation. A cooling fan and long hallway were used to produce an indoor controlled wind field. A small-scale wire and wood doweling cubic framework with small vertical and horizontal flags attached was constructed to fit into this hallway and used to characterize the downwind air flow for three different wind turbine blade configurations. The wind turbine built for last year's science fair project (Wind Turbine Design) was used for this investigation. This wind turbine had nine removable blades that were set at the previously determined optimum attack angle of 35 degrees. Both video and still photo measurements of the air flow patterns were made for this turbine with nine, six and three blades attached. Analysis of 4,000 individual measurements of the small flags indicated that indeed the three-bladed wind turbine produced the least air flow disturbance. Also, the disruption due to the wind turbine support stand indicated an appreciable blocking disturbance. This low cost instrumentation can be used to determine the optimum shape for the wind turbine blade and support tower that are used on the full-scale wind turbines.

School # 2 of Dzerzhinsk, Dzerzhinsk, Nizhegorodskaya, RUSSIA

Satellite navigation together with mobile telephony and television are the most demanded novel techniques of our century. All of them are based on propagation of electromagnetic waves in Earth atmosphere. An influence of atmospheric conditions on TV or phone signals is only qualitative (better/worse) while it becomes quantitative in case of GPS navigation (higher/lower accuracy). Knowing atmosphere contents and plasma concentration in magnetosphere allows taking into account variation of signal propagation velocity, then to calculate delays in plasma and to increase positioning accuracy up to an order. To the moment only signal averaging over large time intervals is used for this purpose. <br><br>To obtain necessary atmosphere parameters we can observe wave propagation in a wide frequency range. A number of experiments have been implemented by authors including i) passive signal observations in TV wavelength range as well as in ranges of mobile communications and GPS navigation; ii) active observations in ranges of 150 MHz, 430 MHz and 10 GHz with use of laboratory transceivers including self-made devices; iii) passive studies of weather conditions influence on satellite communications with use of 2-meter 10-GHz radio telescope; iv) study of meteorological conditions influence on microwave radiation of atmospheric ozone in 30-50 GHz range with use of receivers of IAP RAS and SURA ionosphere station.<br><br>In was found in a result that variations of atmosphere parameters – temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind velocity and direction, presence of absorbing components – has significant influence on character of propagation of electromagnetic waves. Authors intend to develop recommendations allowing one to improve parameters of various receiving and transmitting devices.

HOW DO DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHT WAVES AFFECT THE SPEED OF A SOLAR PANELED CAR?

This project tested colored light’s affect on a solar paneled car’s speed. The researchers hypothesized that different light energy levels would change the car's speed.<br><br>The researchers tested to see how different colored light waves created different speeds on a solar paneled car. A variety of colored transparencies were laid on the car and the car was timed and the results recorded. These trials were run ten times for each color.<br><br>The data came out in the following order after finding the mean from ten trials: orange, red, yellow, purple, blue, green (ORYPBG). White light (sunlight) created the most energy. <br><br>The data supported the hypothesis. The different colors had different frequencies which led to different energy production levels. Light with the highest frequency and shortest wavelength produced the best results in terms of energy production and the light with the lowest frequency and longest wavelength produced the least favorable results. The next step would be to see how much money and energy could be saved from an actual solar paneled car when compared to a normal gas consuming car. If it is cost efficient then the project could be continued by seeing if an actual solar paneled car could be created. This could be done by researching what would be used to construct the car, and if the world has the resources to produce and provide these cars for many people.

H-ALPHA [O III] PHOTOMETRY OF GALACTIC PLANE CANDIDATE PLANETARY NEBULAE
Stephen J Morrison, Laree Gardner, Genevieve Wang
Grosse Pointe North High School, Grosse Pointe Woods, MI

Planetary nebulae are emission nebulae that represent a common endpoint of stellar evolution for medium to low mass stars. Currently, it is estimated that 3000 of these objects are present in the Milky Way, but that number is likely to rise as surveys of the galaxy in wavelengths characteristic with chemicals abundant in planetaries are conducted. The purpose of our project was to attempt to classify objects labeled as possible but unconfirmed planetary nebulae in several catalogs resulting from recently conducted galactic plane surveys, specifically the MASH, IPHAS, and Kronberger catalogs. Since many of these objects are obscured by the dust of the galactic plane, the conventional method of determining their nature based on morphologies is not applicable. To accomplish the classification of these candidate nebulae, CCD images using narrow band-pass hydrogen-alpha and oxygen-III filters were taken using the 0.9 m WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Using the photometry tool in the program Maxim DL, we determined the average photon counts in all images. The [O III] / H-alpha ratio was found for a known PN as well as for two objects often confused visually with PNe, a Wolf-Rayet nebula and an HII region. These ratios were found to be consistent and distinct for each of our known objects and could then be compared to those of our unknown objects to determine their nature. This novel diagnostic technique is a low-tech, low-cost photometric approach. One previously undetermined object was confirmed as a planetary nebula.

ELECTROSTATIC POWER AMPLIFICATION
Samuel Davis Kater, Tucker Leavitt, 
Animas High School, Durango, CO

Our project involves an evolving inquiry of energy amplification of plasma strands traveling through air. We used a Tesla coil as a means of experimentation to test our hypothesis that discharges do gain energy from traveling through the air. Our initial experiments employed a high resistance attenuator probe that we constructed and terminated at an oscilloscope in order to assess the energy content of the sparks. These experiments, when analyzed using Probability Theory, indicated that our data were normally distributed. If this were to be incorrect, power amplification through electrostatics would be impractical due to power fluctuations. After mathematically proving the normal distribution of our data, we then devised a way of measuring energy augmentation by varying the distances at which we recorded energy content. Numerous high precision instruments (e.g. oscilloscope) were used to collect our data as accurate as possible, and enable us to compensate for possible discrepancies. Several significant suggestions arose from these experiments, including that sparks do gain energy, and there is an optimum distance at which this energy augmentation is maximized. The implications of these findings are quite significant as they suggest the ability to increase efficiency in power production; however, in order to be rigorous, it was important to consider all possible sources of error that might confound our results, hence the need for precision instruments. Considering the contemporary need for effective energy supply, the suggestions made by our data are most certainly significant and noteworthy.

VALIDATION OF PARABOLIC ION TRAP GEOMETRIES FOR APPLICATION WITHIN QUANTUM COMPUTING
Jennifer Wang, Grace Young, 
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD

Efficient light collection from individual trapped atomic ions is considered essential for the deployment of large-scale quantum computing networks based upon an atom-photon interface. Current ion traps restrict light collection to approximately 2% of emitted photons, severely limiting the overall success probability of network connections. Trapping ions at the focus of a parabolic reflector could increase the light collection efficiency to a theoretical maximum of 100%, increasing quantum network performance by a factor of 2,500. By constructing and mathematically modeling three trap designs for hollow glass microspheres, this research validates novel approaches for incorporating parabolic reflectors into particle traps. It is believed that this work is the first to demonstrate experimentally that parabolic reflectors can be successfully implemented as electrodes and could achieve the predicted increases in light collection efficiency. The adaptation of these designs could remove one of the barriers to incorporating ion traps into large-scale quantum computing networks.

WHAT COLOR LIGHT SHINES BEST THROUGH FOG?
Jed Donald Grow, Andrew Quinn Ross, 
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

Temperature inversions and the corresponding fog associated with temperature inversions in northern Utah, decreases visibility and safety conditions. A series of studies were conducted to identify the optimal color of visible light to shine through fog to improve visibility and safety in potentially hazardous conditions. To determine the most effective light color, a box with a known volume was filled with fog, proportional to the average density of an inversion. Six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet) of visible light were tested using forty (40) trials per color. A colored light was stationed on one end of the box. A simplified spectroscope was positioned at the opposite end of the box to measure the intensity of light passing through the fog in mW/cm2. Red produced the highest overall readings; violet the lowest. When the density of fog was increased, there was a corresponding linear declination in each reading for each color. Repeated testing showed that red is the most efficient color to increase visibility and safety when seeking to penetrate fog. Red light could be useful when developing precautionary lights used on highways, harbors, and other areas that frequently experience a decrease in visibility caused by weather conditions, including fog or temperature inversions.

UTILIZING A VARIANT OF THE LORENTZ FORCE EQUATION TO ANALYZE MAGNETOSPHERE SUPPLEMENTATION AND SHIELDING FROM IONIZING RADIATION
Jonathan Tyler Calton, Alex Allan Curry, 
Sunlake High School, Land O Lakes, FL

New evidence has shown that the Magnetosphere is weakening and the earth’s magnetic poles may flip within the next one thousand years. If our Magnetosphere flipped poles, then our earth would run a high risk of being left without a Magnetosphere for a very long time. With no Magnetosphere left to protect the earth, our planet would be bombarded with ionizing radiation from the sun and from deep space until the Magnetosphere returned to normal, which could take hundreds of years.<br><br>To protect ourselves from harmful ionizing radiation, we hypothesize that electromagnetic field-producing satellites could be used to supplement our Magnetosphere. <br><br>This year’s procedure involved updating our math from last year and then testing the practicality of using a magnetic field producing satellite to supplement our earth’s Magnetosphere. To test our ideas, we used our calculations to analyze particle interactions in magnetic fields and then used our data to determine overall practicality. We also worked on designing a satellite that would meet the requirements needed to successfully supplement our earth’s Magnetosphere.<br><br>Our math shows that a .3 Tesla magnetic field would be needed to shield all types of ionizing radiation. On earth, the magnetic field would not need to be as strong because earth is typically exposed only to solar wind, which is much weaker than other forms of ionizing radiation found in deep space.<br><br>After updating last year’s math and correcting for all of the problems with those calculations, we have concluded that the results from last year, although slightly different than this year’s results, still hold true in concept. Last year, we determined that a .2 Tesla magnetic field would be sufficient to block incoming ionizing radiation, while this year’s results showed that a .3 Tesla magnetic field would be needed. There is little difference in size and weight for a .2 Tesla electromagnet and a .3 Tesla electromagnet, so the needed electromagnet would still be within a satellite’s carrying capacity. Our final conclusion is that using satellites with electromagnets would be a practical way to supplement our earth’s Magnetosphere.

MEASUREMENT OF THE EARTH-MOON DISTANCE BY A DYNAMIC METHOD

Instituto Parroquial Bernardo D'Elia, Villa Carlos Paz, Cordoba, ARGENTINA

The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was an excellent opportunity for the popularization of this science. Since Astronomy excites curiosity, it provides natural motivations for learning Science.<br><br> The aim of this work is to determine if it is possible to develop an accessible method for the measurement of the Earth-Moon distance from the city of Villa Carlos Paz during 2009. In order to achieve the main goal two objectives were pursued:<br><br> • The construction of an economically accessible and easy-to-use device.<br><br> • The development and application of a procedure for the measurement of the Earth-Moon distance using that device.<br><br> The device provides the topocentric angular position of the Moon at the measuring time. Angular position variations are found from successive measurements every one sidereal day, and thus the angular velocity of the Moon. Assuming a circular motion for the Moon around the Earth and considering the gravitational attraction between them, it is possible to calculate the distance from the angular velocity of the Moon as seen from Earth.<br><br> We found distance values ranging from 374000km up to 413000km, with an average uncertainty of 5000km. They are within the range found in the literature, therefore our original hypothesis was confirmed.<br><br> Additionally the measurements accuracy allowed the detection of systematic variations in the Earth-Moon distance that empirically supports that the lunar orbit is elliptical. Future improvements taking into account Kepler Laws could make use of angular velocity variations to provide also the orbital eccentricity and the position of the apsides.

The amount of water available for human consumption and its uses, are subjects that nowadays bring about controversy between those who takes brings back to consciousness on the same. <br><br>Because around 70% of the fresh water available in the planet it is destined to agriculture, our project has the purpose of using solely the amount of water necessary to seed different products and to contribute with the saving of the vital liquid. The project is based on the use of resistances and detects the humidity in the ground around the plant. We construct special boxes to seed different cultures, which adapted with copper cable to facilitate the detection of the humidity, that is reflected in a LED in the device; to greater faster humidity the sparkle and to smaller humidity smaller frequency of sparkle. The pulse frequency is controlled by the resistance between the ends. The resistance between those depends on the humidity that detect. Greater humidity, less resistance and on the contrary. The obtained results were satisfactory since in all the cases in which it was experienced, the used water was smaller in more of 50% comparing with the water that normally is used to cultivate the same products. We try to adapt display to improve the prototype turning it of qualitative to quantitative, besides using a potentiometer to vary the resistance according the amount of water that requires the culture with which it works.

This project investigated the electrical properties of Corn Cob Ash (CCA) specifically its conductivity and resistivity curve to establish its semiconducting behavior and potential application as temperature sensor. This is a pioneer study in converting corn cob wastes into a high-value material for the semiconductor industry.<br><br> Two hundred grams (200g) of chopped corn cobs were first charred using a Bunsen burner. These were reduced to 6g of ash after combustion in the furnace at 700ºC, two grams of which were pelletized under standard pressure of 10 tons for characterization tests. <br><br>X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was done to determine the phases and nature of the sample in powder form. XRD patterns revealed diffraction angles that ascribe the presence of silica (SiO2), indicating the CCA’s pozzolanic character. <br><br> <br><br> The Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy of the pelletized sample confirmed the existence of pure silicon that is 6.17% by weight.<br><br>The Four Point Probe Method revealed a conductivity of the pellet at 3.68x10-5 S/cm at 300K, a measurement within the range of semiconducting materials, and the resistivity curve showed an average resistance that is decreasing with increasing temperature.<br><br> The results confirmed that CCA exhibits semiconducting properties with a resistance that is highly sensitive to changes in temperature, which is indicative of a high potential for its development into thermistors.

MUON DETECTION AT ELEVATION

Radiation, though not understood well by many, impacts the lives of us all in untold ways. Background ionizing radiation is now known to be a constant part of life on Earth, and the various particles created through this radiation are very mysterious. The constant, persistent stream of particles (particularly muons) is always present in and around the various organisms on the Earth's surface. The consequences of being constantly subjected to this radiation remains an important long-term question in biology. Lab experiments have been carried out on these various particles and many measurements have been taken regarding their behavior, but it remains difficult to carry out tests in the field to discern more about their behavior in nature. This project centers on the behavior of the muon, a subatomic fermion that has been studied extensively. The goal of this project is to apply the fundamentals of special relativity in regards to time dilation (through the Lorentz transformation) in order to determine if there are energy sources capable of generating muons besides cosmic rays. This is accomplished through the use of two detectors capable of monitoring muon levels at different altitudes and measuring their rates of decay. By analyzing the resulting data, we are attempting to discern if any other types of radiation exist with enough energy to generate muons in significant quantities.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE DIELECTRIC RESPONSE OF THE 8CB LIQUID CRYSTAL OVER THE NEMATIC-ISOTROPIC PHASE TRANSITION
Priya Garg
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

Due to the industrial applications of liquid crystals, research focused on their dielectric properties has practical value relating to better controllability. One area not yet fully explored is the behavior of the LC during its phase transitions; in this investigation, the dielectric properties of the 8CB (4’-octyl-4-biphenyl carbonitrile) liquid crystal were examined over its nematic-isotropic phase transition. The capacitor was connected in a series RC circuit, with R = 1 kΩ. A temperature controller and RCL meter were used to control the temperature of the cell (35° C - 45° C), control frequency (100 Hz and 10 kHz) and voltage (0.05 V and 2 V), and collect data on capacitance. A few conclusions were reached: Firstly, the polarizability of the LC increases over the phase transition at all settings except 2 V,10 kHz; but the LC is much less polarized at 10 kHz than it is at 100 Hz. Secondly, the LC has linear dielectric properties around its phase transition and nonlinear behavior during the phase transition. No standard regressions exhibited the nonlinear behavior perfectly and further examination of the results suggests that a jump discontinuity as the LC shifts from one phase to the next makes further searching impractical. Thirdly, the anomaly of the dielectric constant decreasing at the 2 V, 10 kHz setting indicates that the 8CB liquid crystal reaches its maximum dielectric strength in the nematic phase sometime between .05 V and 2 V, causing the polarizability to decrease over the phase transition.

SIZE-EFFECTS ON CORRELATED ETCHING OF FEW-LAYERED GRAPHENE NANORIBBONS
Arunita Kar
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Graphene, an exciting, two-dimensional carbon allotrope, has shown great potential for use in a wide variety of nanoelectronic applications. Most of these applications require some method of confining electrical charge through precise lateral boundaries called nanoribbons. Crystallographic etching through the use of hydrogenation via metallic catalysts particles is one promising technique which has emerged. In this method, etch tracks are formed along the crystal axes of the graphene at high temperature under a controlled hydrogen and argon atmosphere. Effective utilization of this technique is affected by the thickness of the graphene sample upon which crystallographic etching is carried out. This experiment studies the effects of graphene sheet-thickness on spatial correlation of the etch tracks.

ENGINEERING A WORKING MODEL OF THE CASIMIR EFFECT: MODELING THE CASIMIR EFFECT
Alysia Renea Flores
John A. Johnson Senior High School, St. Paul, MN

The purpose of my experiment was to model the Casimir Effect, which is the attraction between two objects (with no charges of any kind) caused by empty space. My hypothesis was if the model was done correctly, I could get two objects to close towards one another and stay closed. Materials needed for this experiment were: 2 magnetic stirrers, 2 glass plates (25cm tall-15cm wide), water, 2 magnetic sticks, alligator clips, clamps, paper clips and 2 spring scales. Procedure: Place a filled fish tank with water on top of the 2 magnetic stirrers. Place magnetic sticks inside the fish tank (one on each magnetic stirrer). Take alligator clips and place on edges of plates and weave 2 paper clips into clamps and alligator clips. Lower glass plates into the fish tank and tightened clamps on fish tank 5.5 cm APART on center edge of fish tank. Turn stirrers on to full speed. Place Newton spring scales at bottom of each plate and record the Newton force. The measurements that I received for the right mainly stayed within the range of .3N and .6N. The measurements I received for the left side were ranged from .2N - .5N. I found this to be because the magnetic stirrer on the right side had a weaker speed then the left side. After taking down my data for 10 trials I calculated the average force being applied on the plates. My findings supported my hypothesis. The plates remained closed the entire time.

LIGHT AMPLIFICATION BY STIMULATED EMISSION OF RADIATION PHOTON INHIBITION
Blaine Mitchell Oldham
James Bowie High School, Austin, TX

Gaseous/vaporous substances emitted into the atmosphere in the path of a laser beam were compared in their ability to block the laser’s photons. Photon inhibition was measured by the electrical current produced when photons not inhibited would strike a solar cell, and measured in volts by a digital volt meter. The means of the data collected are as follows: 1.4125 V (air), .3125 V (mist), 1.0525 V (fire), .5250 V (smoke), and .4850 V (rain).<br><br> An unexpected factor that had an effect on the amount of photons produced by the laser was the temperature of the lasing medium. The original procedure was altered to accommodate for this, and two separate tests for each material were created. The laser was first tested through substances at 51 degrees Fahrenheit, and again after having been heated for 15 seconds. When evaluated with ANOVA and two-sample t-tests, the data is determined to be statistically different between the two types of tests as well as between the materials themselves.<br><br> Environmental conditions including the materials tested would interfere with lasers used in industries involving long distances such as landscapers, the military, and organizations such as NASA. If there is even a minute amount of particulates in the path of the laser over a long distance, the trajectory and power of the laser could be altered. This would be disastrous as these lasers are used for tasks requiring precision.

MICROWAVES DESTROY THE NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF PREPACKAGED FOODS - FACT OR FICTION?
Abdul Hamid Kassem
Redeemer Baptist School, North Parramatta, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA

A prospective study was performed to investigate whether microwaves destroy the nutritional content of prepackaged foods. Eleven randomized subjects solely consumed microwavable prepackaged food and water for a week with both the investigator and pathologist blinded to both the identity of each subjects' blood samples and respective cooking procedure: oven (control) or microwave. After a three week wash-out period and a cross-over of cooking methods, subjects consumed identical meals as the initial week.<br><br>Due to the specific frequency of microwaves to agitate water molecules, a reduction in water soluble nutrients was hypothesized while fat soluble nutrients were expected to remain stable. This hypothesis was supported by respective 5.4% and 3.6% decrease in water soluble Vitamin B12 and glucose levels, while fat soluble Vitamin D remained relatively stable with a 0.5% increase. However, an anomaly to the hypothesis occurred with water soluble Vitamin B9 increasing by 4%. Consequently, the investigator now believes microwave radiation initially releases water soluble molecules, ready for absorption, causing elevated blood levels. Specific molecules such as Vitamin B12, composed of multiple protein molecules, are then broken down by the microwave radiation.<br><br>Another major finding was a significant 4.05% reduction(P =0.046) in high density lipoprotein (HDL) when prepackaged food is cooked in a microwave versus conventional oven. a subsequent food trial involving 23 subjects consuming prepackaged meat pies resulted in a similar, though highly significant 4.64% reduction (P =0.005)in HDL levels, providing validity to the argument that microwaving does effect the human body.

OPTIMIZATION OF DBD PLASMA ACTUATOR GEOMETRY FOR MAXIMUM FORCE PRODUCTION
Kelly Elizabeth Gray
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

Plasma actuators have many different applications. One of which is used on an airfoil to keep the airflow over the airfoil consistent & eliminate separation in the airflow. Current research is being conducted to create a plasma actuator that can be placed on the airfoil to eliminate separation of the airflow from happening. <br><br> In my project I made a set of DBD (Dielectric Barrier Discharge) plasma actuators that had a piece of copper tape as the grounded and powered electrode. The powered electrode was 10 cm long and 2 mm wide. The grounded electrode varied in width (1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, & 20 mm) and were 10 cm long. The gap in between the powered & grounded electrodes were varied as well, no gap, 1 mm & 2 mm gap. I tested to see that if a change in the geometry of the actuators affects that force that is produced. These actuators were tested at various voltages from 10V Pk-Pk to 16V Pk-Pk. The actuators ran for 30 seconds and the force was recorded.<br><br> It was found that at higher voltages there is a greater force produced. For the 10 mm and 20 mm grounded electrode there wasn’t a significant rise in the force. This is due to the electric field’s dissipation is unable to achieve maximum coverage with the grounded electrode. The no gap and 1 mm gap in between the powered & grounded electrodes created a rise in the voltages. The 2 mm gap however, required higher voltages to create plasma because the electric field had farther to extend.<br><br> The grounded electrode & the gap are representative of factors present on an airfoil that contribute to the efficiency of the overall performance of the plane. Attaching these actuators to an airfoil will eliminate the disturbance in the airflow; therefore creating a more efficient, cheaper flight.

THE EFFECT OF TRACKING ERROR ON THE MEASUREMENT EXOPLANET LIGHT CURVES
Brian Ronald Graham
Southridge High School, Beaverton, OR

The intent of this project was to determine the effect of tracking error on the quality of exoplanet light curves. During transits of exoplanets between Earth and their respective stars, the apparent magnitude of the star drops slightly. When this drop is plotted over time, the result is a light curve. Unfortunately, while taking images of the star during transit, it is possible for the telescope to inconsistently track the star, resulting with inaccurate measurements of the star’s brightness. The hypothesis was that light curves would more closely match the expected values for known transiting exoplanets after images with tracking error were removed. To test this hypothesis, images were taken during a transit of the exoplanet HD 189733b. A program was designed and written to analyze the images, detect tracking error, and remove those images from the set. Using the software, the remaining images were plotted to create a second light curve. The new light curve was compared with a light curve which used all of the images. The results of the experiment showed that, when the tracking error was removed, the light curve showed values for the transit depth and duration that were much closer to the predicted values. The field of exoplanet research has been fueled by the participation and discoveries by amateur astronomers and this software has potential applications for those who do not possess telescope mounts which have the accuracy required to take consistently high quality images.

STRATOSPHERE - IONOSPHERE COUPLING: THE EFFECTS OF SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING ON THE IONOSPHERE
Cayley Erin Dymond
North Point High School for Science, Technology, and Industry, Waldorf, MD

The purpose of this project was to test the validity of the hypothesis: if sudden stratospheric warming occurs, then measurements of the global ionosphere will show changes from pre-warming periods that are different at different longitudes and at different times during the day and these changes will be similar for different warming events. Ionospheric measurements made by the COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) satellites from periods of stratospheric warming in 2007 - 2010 were analyzed and used to test the hypothesis. Programs were written using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) to read, manipulate, and analyze the data. Statistical analysis of the results was performed to assess the significance of the results. The hypothesis was partially validated and partially invalidated. The ionospheric response was observed to be different in different longitude sectors, validating one prediction of the hypothesis. The ionospheric response differed as a function of local time, validating another prediction of the hypothesis. However, the ionospheric response to SSWs was not similar from event-to-event, invalidating the third prediction. The COSMIC data proved to be a useful measurement set for characterizing and studying the global ionospheric response to SSWs.

THE USE OF SOUND WAVES WITH MULTILATERATION FORMULAS TO FIND THE OPTIMAL METHOD TO LOCATE AN OBJECT IN THREE DIMENSIONS
Erin Nicole Lewis
Harmony High School, Saint Cloud, FL

Real-time positioning systems use signals with surveillance and navigation techniques to locate an object. If a sound signal is sent to receivers in known locations, the difference in the time that the sound signal arrives at each receiver can be used to calculate the position of the source of sound. Multilateration formulas with the relative time difference of arrival (TDOA) and Trilateration formulas with the absolute time of arrival (TOA) can be used to pinpoint the location of the sound source. This project compared both methods as well as a range of sound frequencies from 62 to 8000 Hz to find the optimal means of locating the actual position of the sound source in three dimensions. <br><br>Four microphones were set up in a 20 x 10 meter rectangle with two additional microphones 1.5 meters above. Sound signals were played through a speaker from four different locations and recorded through the microphones. Audacity software was used to analyze the both the TOA and TDOA for the signal at each microphone. The hypothesis was that the speaker location could be found within +/- 0.5 m and that the higher frequencies would have less error. It was found that sound frequencies greater than 250 Hz located the speaker the smallest margin of error. Both the TDOA and the TOA formulas were able to calculate the position within one-half a meter for majority of the tests. The average error between TOA and TDOA formulas was not significantly different, however TOA formulas had less variation.

THE FLOW FEATURE AROUND INSECTS AND BIONIC WING BASED ON WIND TUNNEL TEST
Yimeng Shi
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

We can study the lift of a flying insect by observing and analyzing airflows around its body and wings. I designed a wind tunnel which uses smoke-streakline for flow field visualization and can display flow characteristics with low-speed wind. During experiments, flying bees or a vibrating bionic wing were put into the wind tunnel, and a high speed camera was used to record the information of the flow field. As results we obtained images of the surrounding flow fields of forward-flying bees and a vibrating bionic wing. By analyzing these images, I conclude that (1) for a forward-flying insect there exists body lift, but its wing lift plays a dominating role, (2) a vibrating bionic wing can be used to simulate an insect’s wing and to illustrate, to some extent, the interactions between an insect’s wing and its surrounding airflow, and (3) an important feature of bees is that the maximum instantaneous lift exceeds 5 times of the gravity. I also made some additional experiments to compare the flying patterns of different insects in order to understand factors of flapping flying.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL SCANNER OF THE ANGULAR SPECTRUM
Polina Vladimirovna Shalaeva
Lyceum # 40, Nizhny Novgorod, RUSSIA

Measurement of the phase profile of the optical wave, or wavefront sensing is required for astronomy, optical element testing, ophthalmology, adaptive optics technology, etc.<br><br>One of the simplest and the most effective methods for wavefront sensing is the Hartmann test that is based on the measurement of local slopes of the wavefront. But when implementing the method one inevitably faces either strongly limited dynamic range (Shack-Hartmann sensor) or the necessity to perform a great number of sequential measurements (Hartmann wavefront scanner).<br><br>It would be curious to develop a Hartmann method modification which would feature a high dynamic range of the scanning-sensor and help to decrease the number of measurements.<br><br>In this paper a novel method for wavefront sensing which meets the mentioned requirements is described. The method is a further development of the Hartmann test. It is based on the idea of scanning of the angular spectrum of the studied optical wave using the screen with the opening.<br><br>Theoretical studies of the main characteristics of the method were conducted and the algorithm for reconstruction of the phase function. We also conducted the numerical modeling of the experiment based on the proposed method.<br><br>A setup was designed for experimental testing of the proposed method.

The purpose of this experiment is to test the same four golf balls and two drivers from last years experiment at two different driving ranges to see if there is an impact on how far the balls will travel based on the type of grass that is planted. <br><br>The hypothesis is the Titleist Pro V1x golf ball using the Taylor Made r5 driver will travel the farthest on the Harbor Oak Golf Course located at #1 Harbor Oaks, Pine Bluff, Arkansas.<br><br>Using the same four golf balls and two drivers from last year's testing along with golf tees and a measuring gauge, the experiment was done by driving each golf ball four times each on the fairway instead of the driving range. Distance was measured with the measuring gauge. Distance was then charted on a piece of paper. After hitting all the golf balls four times with each driver on the fairway at each golf course and charting their distance, the average distance was calculated for each ball traveled. The one with the highest average was the winner.<br><br>The hypothesis was the Titleist Pro V1x golf ball using the Taylor Made r5 driver on the Harbor Oaks Golf Course (Mini Verde Bermuda #419) would travel the farthest and the null hypothesis was the Noodle golf ball using the Taylor Made r5 on the Jaycees Golf Course (Common Tiff Bermuda Grass) would travel the farthest. The Noodle golf ball (at the cost of $0.88 per ball) driven with the Cleveland Launcher ($315 medium priced driver) hit on the #16 fairway at the Harbor Oaks Golf Course ended up going the farthest out of the four balls with an average of 211 yards. The Srixon golf ball (at the cost of $2.07 per ball) driven with the Cleveland Launcher ($315 medium priced driver) hit on the #16 fairway at the Harbor Oaks Golf Course came in a close second with an average of 204 yards.

Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

Purpose: <br><br>To develop an inexpensive spectrophotometer to help students understand the principle of spectrophotometry and to write a novel computer program to analyze the spectral image.<br><br>Procedure: <br><br>The spectrophotometer was built at home. A diffraction grating, LED, convex lens, photoresistor, multimeter and cuvettes were purchased for $31. Materials made from cardboard or wood pieces and the CD were available at home. The spectrophotometer was made in two ways, employing two different data gathering techniques. In the first method, an LED was shined onto a CD through a convex lens, emerging light was impinged on a photoresistor attached behind the cuvette. The resistance was measured with a multimeter and plotted. In the second method, the LED was shined through a cuvette, emerged light fell on a diffraction grating and the spectrum was captured with a camera. Serial dilutions of two solutions, potassium permanganate and green food color, were used. A Matlab program was written to analyze spectral image by RGB, intensity, and absorbance plotting. A graphical user interface was created for data input.<br><br>Data: <br><br>The resistance due to emitted light increased with increasing concentration of solutions following Beer-Lambert Law <br><br>(A=-log(I/Io)=elc). In the image analysis method, similar increase in absorbance was observed with increasing concentration. The new Matlab spectral analysis program measured changes in concentration using spectral images and created graphs.<br><br>Conclusion: <br><br>This simple spectrophotometer demonstrates the principle of spectrophotometry. The image analysis method was more reproducible than the resistance method. The Matlab program created can be used to analyze spectral images.

THE AURORA ACCELERATOR
Nicholas James Nothom
Waconia High Scool, Waconia, MN

The main purpose of the Aurora Accelerator is to examine the very building blocks of the atoms that comprise the world we live in. Although operating at an energy which has been observed before, it’s design and size allow for some experiments to be conducted which were not previously possible in classical cyclotron designs. An example is the "built-in" Induction Heater which examines the barrier potential at varying temperatures, these temperatures are also measured by an infrared thermometer. There is not one experiment that the Aurora Accelerator was destined to complete, it’s design is the multi-tool of particle physics research. A cost effective construction and large interior, with many instruments, allows for various experiments to be conducted with little altercation. The Aurora Accelerator is capable of an accelerating energy of 70 Kilo-Electron Volts(70 Thousand Electron-Volts) directly out of the Electron Gun, A velocity equal to 44% the speed of light. At this velocity, each electron dilates time by a factor of 1.17. This means that for an electron with a lifetime of 15 seconds, it would travel 2.55 Seconds into the future. This effect can be proven, because from the viewpoint of the observer, the electrons last approximately 1.17 times longer than they would have if time dilation was not taken into account. The final accelerating voltage, however, is constantly changing and improving. The final accelerating energy at the present is 1.6 Million Electron Volts. This energy is enough to create positrons, the antimatter partner of the electron, as well as at the base voltage immediately following the electron gun. Providing a window to the future of how we will power our spaceships, the building you are standing in, this computer, and the phone in your pocket.

CHARACTERIZING THE EFFECTS OF ASTEROID BELT PERTURBATIONS ON THE ORBITS OF THE INNER PLANETS
Nikita Michael Bogdanov
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

The planets in the solar system are subject to multiple gravitational perturbations from other solar system bodies including other planets, large asteroids (as discrete point masses), and small asteroids (cumulatively). The largest uncertainty in our knowledge of the orbits of the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, is due to perturbations from the complicated and uneven mass distribution within the asteroid belt (e.g., masses of asteroids range over many orders of magnitude).<br><br>The goals of this project are to computationally model the effects of perturbations from the 300 largest asteroids on the orbits of the inner planets; specifically, this project looks to characterize the perturbative effects as a noise problem, which is a novel approach. In order to do this, I have created a numerical integration framework that models Newtonian solar system interactions. Initial integrations show that numerical red noise is orders of magnitude below asteroid gravitational perturbations. I analyze these perturbations by comparing integrations with and without specific subsets of perturbing asteroids.<br><br>To analyze orbital element residuals I use power spectra. These yield the frequencies and amplitudes of the gravitational perturbation signals and are the first step to characterizing perturbations from a noise perspective. I find that the power spectra can exhibit red noise at low frequencies and reach a noise floor (white noise) at higher frequencies. White noise precludes the knowledge of planetary motion at the sub-meter to meter level, an original result. Tools to discriminate between chaotic and stochastic motion will be employed in future work.

MODELING QUENCH PROPAGATION IN A SYSTEM OF INTERCONNECTED SUPERCONDUCTING COILS
Emil Timergalievich Khabiboulline
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Superconducting magnets yield a wide scope of useful applications, but they must account for the development of “quenches,” a phenomenon through which the energy stored in the magnetic field dissipates in a concentrated location. This process not only causes the loss of superconductivity, but can also severely damage the magnet and its surroundings. Computer modeling of quench propagation allows for the analysis of protection techniques that limit the negative effects of quenches. In this research, several variations of a program based on the MATLAB computing language were created to model quench propagation in a system of superconducting focusing solenoids planned for future use at Fermilab. The investigation yielded results regarding the effects of dump resistor placement and resistance on quench propagation. Data such as maximum temperature, voltage to ground, energy dissipation, and current decay was acquired through the computer programs. Currently, modeling and data collection has been completed for two quench protection schemes, with both models taking into account the location of the quench’s origin. Further analysis has determined which of these techniques should be implemented for most effective protection. The results of this work may influence the design of future devices using superconducting solenoids, such as particle accelerators.

D+D FUSION REACTIONS IN AN INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTOR
William Wellborn Jack
Hudson High School, Hudson, OH

This project is an overview of the possibility of using an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion reactor (IEC fusion reactor) as a device in which to study fusion reactions of the type D+D -> He-3 (.82MeV)+ n (2.45MeV) . It was hypothesized that the constructed reactor would be capable of carrying out a significant amount of D+D reactions. For the experiment, a Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor was constructed, along with a neutron detection system based upon a boron-10 lined proportional tube resting inside a high density polyethylene neutron moderator. A neutron moderator is device which slows fast neutrons from fusion reactions to thermal levels, which is a necessary factor in detecting neutrons with a boron-10 lined proportional tube. An initial count of the natural neutron background was first taken, and then was compared to a count of the neutron background while the tube was outside of the fast neutron moderator and the IEC reactor was running. These two numbers showed no increase in count rate while the reactor was operating, hence indicating that the boron-10 tube was not detecting gamma and x-ray radiation from the reactor. The tube was then reinserted into the moderator, and the reactor turned on. A significant increase in neutron count rate was observed, thus showing that a significant amount of fusion was occurring within the reactor. In conclusion, the experiment demonstrated that the IEC fusion reactor is a financially viable and physically small method of neutron production, and is a stable platform for neutron and fusion based experimentation.

DETERMINING EXTRASOLAR PLANETARY PROPERTIES USING THE RADIAL VELOCITY AND TRANSIT METHODS
Megan Marie Nier
Greece Athena High School, Rochester, NY

The following problem statement was investigated: Determine the planetary properties of KEPLER 4b and KEPLER 9c. The article ‘Refined stellar, orbital and planetary parameters of the eccentric HAT-P-2 planetary system’ written by András Pál contains equations of how to find properties of an extra-solar planet. Using the equations provided it is possible to calculate planetary properties: radius, volume, temperature, density and mass of the planet. The radius of the planet can be determined by finding the areas of both the star and planet from the initial value of the star’s radius. The mass can be calculated by an equation stated in the article “Analytic Light Curves for Planetary Transits’, by Mandel & Agol. This equation uses the radial velocity measurements compared to the size of the planet. Once the volume of the planet is calculated, by the planet size calculations, the density can be determined. Then the temperature can be calculated with assumed albedo and emissivity values. The values determined for radius and volume of both planets had a percent error of under 15%. The values calculated for mass and temperature of both planets had a large percent error, around 50%. This large percent error concludes that the density of the host star and orbiting planet are not alike, therefore they may have terrestrial planets. The data found when calculating the KEPLER planets supports the theory; earth-like planets form around low mass stars (~.5 stellar masses or less).

THE OPTIMIZATION OF AN ELECTROSTATIC SOLAR SAIL THROUGH THREE-DIMENSIONAL PLASMA SIMULATION
Austin Joseph Hess
Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School, Mechanicsburg, PA

This project uses three-dimensional plasma simulation to test design aspects of the electrostatic solar sail, a space propulsion method proposed by Pekka Janhunen in 2004. The concept consists of 100 20-kilometer long wires (tethers) radiating from a central craft. If charged positively with an electron gun, they would repel the protons in the solar wind traveling 300-800 km/s away from the Sun, thereby accelerating the craft to extremely high velocities over time. Debye shielding, in which electrons screen the positive electric field from protons, means that only protons within 50 meters of these wires experience the electric field produced by the craft. The student created a C++ program that effectively considered the micro-scale complexities of Debye shielding with the macro-scale application of the electric solar sail. There is a tradeoff, however, between the number of tethers used on the craft and the intensity of the charge distribution. Using more tethers means the craft has fewer gaps between Debye “sheaths” in which the protons can experience the electric field, but this also weakens the electric field by diluting it over a larger area. The student hypothesized that using a greater number of tethers on the craft would optimize the charge distribution while allowing an optimum number of protons to be affected by the craft, thereby imparting more force. The student found that an increase in the number of tethers would indeed have significant benefits for the craft in terms of force, and therefore acceleration.

HIDDEN SOUNDS: THE EFFECT OF CELLULAR PHONE TRANSMISSION ON HUMAN VOICE HARMONIC DISTRIBUTION, YEAR THREE
Ellen Marie Price
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

Cellular phones and other devices that process and modify voices have become an integral part of today’s society. The question investigated in this experiment was, “To what degree and in what ways do the analog-to-digital conversion, compression, and decompression of audio signals in cellular phones significantly alter the magnitudes of the fundamental frequency and harmonics of these audio signals?” The hypothesis was that the distributions of the harmonics would be different.<br><br>Recordings collected for a previous experiment were input into one cellular phone linked to an identical cellular phone, the output from which was recorded with a laptop. The recording was cut into individual sounds and each sound was analyzed by a Fast Fourier Transform, which determines the magnitudes of the components of a complex sound. After the data were normalized in the same way as the previously collected data, a chi-square goodness of fit test was used to compare the distributions of each previously analyzed sample with the corresponding new sample. In almost all cases, the distributions were shown to be significantly different, and the intervals of octave, nineteenth, and twenty-second contributed the greatest error; therefore, the data supported the hypothesis that the distribution was significantly altered.<br><br>Applications of this research include improving recording and processing devices so that harmonics, which give a sound its characteristic sound, are not drastically altered.

DETERMINING "HOT SPOTS" THROUGH CORRELATIONS OF CMES AND SOLAR FLARES
Travis Le
Punahou School, Honolulu, HI

The study of solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are a specific branch of heliophysics. Caused by magnetic reconnection, which releases large amounts of stored energy, solar flares and CMEs are essentially explosions in the atmosphere of the Sun. However, while solar flares stay within the vicinity of the Sun, CMEs are massive bursts of plasma ejected out into space. In addition, halo CMEs, CMEs directed at Earth, can be extremely disastrous to our current lifestyles. This project aimed to determine and track the position of "hot spots" where CMEs are most likely to occur.<br><br> Both the solar flare and the CME data used were collected from the CDAW Data Center. After making the data suitable for data input, extensive programs were created in Fortran 95 to correlate solar flares' and CMEs' occurrences, such that the two phenomena came within a certain time interval and that the CME always came after the solar flare. The time intervals were set from ten minutes to forty minutes with a gradual increase of five minutes. Then by binning the correlated solar flare/CME points, five "hot spots" were determined. These "hot spots" in Carrington longitude_latitude form are 340_20, 190_10, 305_-15, 355_-5, and 230_-15. By creating another program, prediction dates for all five regions were created for the upcoming solar maximum with an error of ±1-2 days. Currently, correlations with these prediction dates are being done to determine which "hot spots" are more likely to form halo CMEs and to prevent a possible catastrophe.

A THEORETICAL STUDY TO INCREASE MOLECULAR SPECIFICITY IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTRA
Vikas Chandra Bhetanabhotla
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

In this study, the usage of C13-Glutamine in C13 NMR is proposed as a better alternative to current methods of detection using Glycine or 1H MRI in order to provide earlier detection of brain tumors. <br><br>Wilson et al. proposed a method of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) using C13-acetic anhydride as a substrate to provide a greater degree of hyperpolarization for biomolecules, such as amino acids. In this study, Fumaric Acid is proposed as a better alternative to C13-acetic anhydride since it has a longer T1 and can react rapidly with amines, meaning that it would provide even greater degree of hyperpolarization for amino acids. Using Fumaric Acid in DNP also allows for a greater degree of hyperpolarization of C13-Glutamine, and thus earlier detection of brain tumors. <br><br>In this study, the factors that make a chemical compound ideal to use in NMR, namely abundance in the human body, T1 and SNR, are theoretically analyzed, and it is determined that based on these factors, C13-Glutamine would provide greater molecular specificity and thus earlier detection of brain tumors than current methods. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood, and given the greater number of blood vessels near cancer cells, imaging Glutamine would enable earlier identification of tumors. Additionally, C-13 Glutamine has a longer T1 and a higher SNR than Glycine, as software-simulated NMR spectra generated in this study show. Ultimately, C13-Glutamine would provide earlier detection of brain tumors due to its long T1, high SNR, and abundance in human blood.

COMPARISON OF BARREL FORCES ON FROZEN AND UNFROZEN PAINTBALLS
Ashley Maree Damavandi
SUCCESS Academy, Cedar City, UT

Purpose: is there a difference in muzzle velocity and the force exerted on a frozen versus an unfrozen paintball as it accelerates in a barrel of a paintball gun? I hypothesized that the barrel forces on both paintballs wold be the same. <br><br>Procedure:<br><br>Determine the muzzle velocity of the paintballs. Do this by aiming the gun vertically upwards and determining how long it takes for the ball to go from trigger-pull back to the ground. <br><br>Then examine the motion of the paintball in the barrel of the gun. The muzzle velocity from step 1 now becomes the final velocity of this motion. Determine the average acceleration of the ball.<br><br>Finally compare the muzzle velocities and average resultant forces for the frozen and unfrozen paintballs.<br><br>Data: <br><br>The frozen paintball's muzzle velocity is 31 m/s and its acceleration in the gun barrel is 1900 m/s2. The average force on the ball of the gun barrel is 11N. <br><br>The unfrozen paintball's muzzle velocity is 42 m/s and its acceleration in the gun barrel is 3400 m/s2. The average force on the ball in the gun barrel is 19N. <br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>When the CO2 gases hit the unfrozen paintball, the ball pushes against the barrel of he gun creating a tight seal which prevents gases from escaping around the ball. This maximizes the force exerted by the CO2 and increases muzzle velocity. There's a difference in both because the frozen paintball breaks, releasing gases.

NEW MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR HOLOGRAPHY: NO LASERS!
Daniel Nathan Liss
Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, Rockville, MD

Today, scientists believe that coherent light (typically laser light) is required to record holograms. Both the spatial phase and amplitude of light from a scene is required in holography. Scientists have obtained this information using the interference of lasers. However, lasers are impractical for taking holograms of people, large objects, and scenes that are not completely stationary. This project demonstrates that modulated incoherent (i.e. ordinary) light may be used to record holograms as faithfully as lasers. <br><br> The first step involved creating several new theoretical mathematical models based on the traditional models used to describe laser-holography. To test the assumptions of the new models, experiments were developed using an LED light as a carrier wave for a modulating signal. Modulated LED light was projected onto a plane, and the phase of the modulating signal on the light was compared to the original modulating signal. The phase relationship was obtained by using the Lissajous patterns on a dual trace oscilloscope, and then compared to the new mathematical models’ predicted results. Strong agreement between the experimental results and the models confirmed the original hypothesis, that the new approach is able to record the same information obtained using lasers. <br><br> This project demonstrates holograms may be generated without lasers, greatly simplifying, reducing the cost, and increasing the safety of the hologram recording process. This new technology could have dramatic impacts on the production of general consumer 3D cameras and holographic television. An additional application is the 3D imaging of organs in a living human body.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SMALL DENSE PLASMA FOCUS USING A NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Adam Joseph Bowman
Montgomery Bell Academy, Nashville, TN

The dense plasma focus is a promising experimental tool with a variety of potential applications. While simplistic in basic design, the device presents several inherent engineering challenges which must be overcome for effective operation. Commonly, plasma focus research is conducted with large, high energy devices. The scalability of plasma focus phenomena, however, enables the small plasma focus to be an equally useful research tool. This project's goal was to develop a simplistic setup for operating a small dense plasma focus.<br><br> Novel solutions to engineering challenges were enacted in the various systems of the device, including pneumatic controls, a simplistic triggering scheme, and a versatile pulsed gas system. The device was used to perform multiple tests to demonstrate its potential utility. X-ray production from the plasma pinch was confirmed, and results were visible after exposing various targets to the plasma. <br><br> Overall, this device displays distinct advantages in both its small size and simplistic design. With specific upgrades, it could act as a useful tool for researching the dynamics and applications of dense plasmas. Possible applications range from use as a fusion research tool to materials modification and X-ray lithography. This experimental platform provides a model for small scale research into the plasma focus, allowing experimentation to extend to smaller facilities and to lower energies.

N-BODY COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES OF THE AEROCAPTURE OF PLANETESIMALS USING SYMPLECTIC ALGORITHMS
Ian Alexander Sohl
DaVinci Academy of Science and the Arts, Ogden, UT

Models using theoretical early atmospheric conditions of Mars show that unaided aerocapture of a Martian moon is unlikely. This is due to the phenomenon that the planetesimal enters the atmosphere at the same point in every orbit and is locked into a decaying spiral. Spacecraft that use aerocapture for orbital insertion establish a stable orbit by performing a thrust maneuver that prevents them from reentering the atmosphere on the next pass.<br><br>The possibility that a planetesimal could use atmospheric drag to decrease excess kinetic energy and enter into a stable planetary orbit was tested, and whether such a process could be applicable for the capture of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos or Neptune’s moon Triton. An n-body computer program was written using a symplectic integration method to simulate possible situations involving the Sun and one or more planetesimals encountering a planetary atmosphere at extremely close range.<br><br>Unless Phobos received a significant velocity boost or destructive fragmentation, an aerocapture scenario inevitably leads to a highly elliptical and decaying orbit. For Mars, the results demonstrate that any combination of location and drag conditions allowing aerocapture inevitably result in the planetesimal crashing into the planet. Triton’s retrograde orbit could be a requirement for aerocapture, which needs further investigation. Also simulated was the possibility that the Martian moons or Triton were captured during the early period of the interplanetary proto-nebula, which could have acted as a large, relatively weak atmosphere, eventually dissipating and leaving the moons in stable orbits.

THE EFFECT OF THERMOPHORESIS ON VERTICAL ALIGNMENT OF DUST PARTICLES IN BILAYER COMPLEX PLASMA
Patrick Louis Facheris
Manatee High School, Bradenton, FL

This research examines the vertical alignment of dust particles in complex plasma into "chains" due to the ion wake field effect and how these chains change with the upward force of thermophoresis. Specifically, the effects of thermophoresis on a monodisperse layer of 8.89 micrometer melamine formaldehyde dust as well as its effects on a bilayer complex plasma with both 8.89 micrometer and 6.5 micrometer particle sizes were studied. Experimental results were compared with those expected in theory to determine effectiveness of using thermophoresis as means to examine ion wake. Using thermophoresis, the levitation height of the particles was increased in both cases. Preliminary results indicated that no correlation was present between lower electrode temperature and any measured quantities; however this could be due to the small number of trials. A possible alternative method to examining ion wake using thermophoresis was discovered when chain length in pixels was compared to the absolute value to the temperature difference between electrodes. A positive correlation was present between this absolute value of the temperature difference and the length of the chain in pixels, which indicates that the ion wake field is not affected by the direction of the force but just the presence and strength of the force and may be an interesting topic for future study.

NONLINEAR MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION OF OPIOID PEPTIDE DELIVERY
Stanley Paul Palasek
Sonoran Science Academy, Tucson, AZ

Neuropeptide transmitters may be introduced exogenously to replace many traditional drugs, providing an increased cellular response with fewer side effects. For successful implementation, problems such as the ease of synthesis, binding, stability, and bioavailability must be overcome. In this study, two equations are derived: the probability of (1) membrane association and of (2) receptor binding as functions of time, diffusion coefficients on and off the membrane, and empirically determined association/dissociation constants. Non-Newtonian calculus is introduced as a method of multiplying continuous, independent probabilities and is implemented in the coupling of the previously described equations for multi-cell systems. A nonlinear equation is obtained and used to compute the expected number of receptors to which a peptide has bound, as a time series. This quantity is to be maximized with respect to these association parameters to optimize bioavailability. Upon acquiring the novel parameters, peptides may be synthesized to exhibit more frequent binding events, substantially improving the drug's overall efficacy.

STEALTH TECHNOLOGY: I CAN SEE YOU...BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ME!!!
Brittany Christine Williams
E.A. Laney High School, Wilmington, NC

Stealth technology is the science behind “invisible” aircraft, or rather aircraft that is undetectable to radar. Stealth Technology incorporates the use of advanced design and specialized materials used to create these “invisible” aircraft. My project involves measuring light reflection among various shape/color combinations, used to simulate radar reflecting off of various stealth aircraft (the less radar reflected back, the less detectable the aircraft). Based upon the reflective properties of each shape/color combination, I can determine whether the object can become “invisible” to radar. My hypothesis is that out of the sixteen different shape/color combinations that I test (glossy and matte, black and white, in combination with cones, cubes, spheres, and cylinders) the black matte cube will reflect the least amount of light because its sharp angles will deflect the light away from the source thereby making it the stealthiest object or hardest to detect and the white glossy sphere will reflect the most amount of light back to the source because of its rounded, large surface area thereby making it the least stealthy or most easily detected object. To do my experiment, I will reflect light onto each of the various shape/color combinations, and then record how much light is reflected back using a Lux meter. What I found was that the black matte cube was, as hypothesized, the stealthiest object with an average Lux of 13.5 while the glossy white sphere was, also as hypothesized, the least stealthy object with an average Lux of 7888.4.

CORRELATION BETWEEN PEEL SPEED AND INTENSITY OF TRIBOLUMINESCENCE IN ADHESIVE TAPE
Elizabeth Caldwell Schroder
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Triboluminescence, light from friction, is produced by the fracture or rubbing of many materials including adhesive tape. The wavelength range of the emitted radiation depends on the composition of the atmosphere in which triboluminescence occurs. The emission of X-rays from triboluminescence under vacuum is of interest in the development of inexpensive tape-based X-ray generators. To manufacture such devices, a better understanding of triboluminescence is needed. This experiment was conducted to determine the correlation between peel speed and intensity of triboluminescence, to confirm that nitrogen emission lines are present in triboluminescence in air, and to determine whether different emission lines appear at different peel speeds. This was tested by peeling adhesive tape with a motor at peel speeds between 5 and 30 cm sec-1 and measuring the triboluminescence with a spectrometer. A positive correlation between peel speed and intensity was observed and nitrogen emission lines were present and consistent throughout. These results give quantitative support for the current theory of triboluminescence. Future studies will focus on the generation of X-rays and the reported optimal peel speed for which triboluminescence has maximum intensity.

DOMAIN WALL DYNAMICS STABILITY FOR MODERN SPINTRONIC APPLICATIONS
Jakub Gregorek
High School Exnarova, Kosice, SLOVAKIA

Electronics has been reaching edges of its possibilities in the last years and we have to seek for new ways of modern technologies research. One of these ways is spintronics which should influence electronics in the future. It is a new and fast growing branch of science and technology. Unlike common electronics which uses electric charge of atoms, spintronics uses magnetic moment for information transport in different appliances. Results of this is lower power consumption and lower warm production of final devices. The most important spintronic application is Race-Track memory in which shiffting of a lot of domain walls is used in a row in a magnetic wires during writing and data reading. It is new type of memory characterized by high density of stored data, speed and unlimited number of overwriting. In my contribution i have focused on influence of induced mechanic axial stresses to domain wall dynamics in Co41,7Fe36,4B11,8Si10,1 microwire. The method i was using for measuring was by Sixtus-Tonks. From measured results we can conclude that application of axial stresses reduces domain wall velocity at high values of magnetic fields, but on the other side it increases stability of domain wall dynamics which is essential to requirement for the future applications of thin magnetic wires in spintronics. Measured independence of domain wall velocity from frequency of applied magnetic field is really important for future applications too. Another usage of these materials are logical circuits on the domain wall basis and they are used in different sensors nowadays.

PARTICLE MOTION IN MICROFLUIDIC CHIPS
Daniel Isao Christe
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

The field of microfluidics involves the control of minute quantities of fluids on lab-on-chip devices. However, particle trajectories were inherently difficult to observe on the micro-scale. This study observed particle motion in a uniform, macroscale array to determine if particle size was the determining factor in particle trajectory. A LEGO® array with equally spaced cylindrical obstacles was suspended by a rig in a tank filled with glycerin. The array’s angle relative to gravity (forcing angle) was gradually increased from 0.00 degrees to approximately 45.00 degrees, and ball bearings of different sizes and densities were dropped through the array at each intermediate angle. Recurring patterns of motion, were recorded in the format <br><br> [x-motion , y-motion]. The repetition of a given pattern formed an overall particle trajectory. Overall particle trajectories were recorded as an average angle (migration angle) from a particle’s entry to exit of array, calculated arctan (x motion/y motion). The results showed that particle trajectory was nonrandom and particle size determined, in an array with uniform obstacle spacing. Particle density was not a factor in particle trajectory. Clear separation between particle sizes was observed, caused by differences in patterned trajectories at given forcing angles. A formula, capable of calculating the most likely forcing angle to separate particles of given sizes was validated by experimental data. Convergence of particle trajectories was also observed at array angles above 40.00 degrees. Both hypotheses were supported by the experimental results.

MAKING WAVES: WATER DEPTH VS. WAVE SPEED
Christopher Francis Chornay
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

This experiment was done to determine how the depth of water affects the speed of waves. A plastic-lined wooden tank, 10'x2'x6", was constructed with a wave-making paddle at one end. Waves at various depths, measured in centimeters (cm), were recorded. This footage was used to determine the velocity of each wave. In the first set of tests, the paddle remained at a fixed height above the bottom of the tank, propelling more water at each subsequent depth. As water depth increased, the velocity of the waves also increased significantly (a=0.05). In the second set of tests, the paddle was kept at a constant depth, independent of the water’s depth. This determined whether or not the previous results were solely a function of the placement of the wave making paddle. The velocity still increased, though not as significantly as in the first test. Both tests showed that as the depth of water increased, the speed of waves also increased. The results of the first test indicated that a larger, faster wave was largely a function of the paddle displacing more water at each depth increase. In the second test, the wave height remained nearly constant. The speed still increased, possibly because of energy carried below the surface, similar to subsurface currents in the ocean. If waves can be slowed by change in the profile of the ocean floor, then this data is applicable in designing protection for coastal areas prone to flooding, high surf and even tsunamis.

MEASURING THE THERMOELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF BI2TE3
Daniela Jane Flax
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

The purpose(s) of the project were: measure the thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3, propose a method for increasing the efficiency of thermoelectric systems (TS) and calculate the method’s efficiency for Bi2Te3 systems using acquired experimental data. <br><br>The Bi2Te3 module was placed between a cooler and thermally insulated heater so the whole heater power went to the module. The generated voltage, heating power crossing the system in steady state and electric resistance at different temperature gradients Δt were measured, required characteristics calculated and their dependence on Δt investigated. <br><br>It was found that the Seebeck coefficient did not change significantly within the interval 12-250C. Electric resistance and thermal conductance increased with Δt. Dependence of thermal conductance on Δt as well as thermal conductivity on temperature showed clear linear character. The maximal efficiency rose with mounting Δt reaching 4.97% at Δt=183C. <br><br>A method based on using liquid flowing through a TS cascade to increase efficiency was proposed. Heat transfer between a plate and flowing liquid was analyzed, efficiency of the method calculated and its dependence on Δt, thermocouple length h, and fluid velocity for different liquid metals investigated.<br><br> <br><br>It was found that the proposed method can increase the efficiency three fold. Efficiency dependence on Δt is positive and strong but much weaker on h and significant only for h/d<15, (d - thermocouple width). Metal change did not play a significant role. <br><br>The method can be efficiently implemented in solar power plants with stocked heat reservoirs and acquired experimental data - in TS designing.

GLIDER WINGS SHAPE
Jason Lathbury
Henry Grady High School, Atlanta, GA

I attempted to demonstrate which shape of glider wing, when thrown, would prove to be most efficient given a standard glider body. I assembled five balsa gliders, each with the standard commercial body. Each glider had a different wing shape: straight, swept or delta with one being the out of the package wing. Each wing had the same surface are of twenty-four inches squared and was fastened into the same position on each glider body. I then threw each glider at four feet off the ground twenty times, measuring how far each one flew to find the glide distance and total time. It was conclusive that the swept wing glider was most efficient with a glide ration of 8.3” to 1’. The commercial glider came in second with a glide ratio of 7” to 1’. Then the straight wing, 5.9’ to 1 and finally the elliptical with 4.4’ to 1’. Oddly enough these results did not exactly follow what I had predicted with my aspect ration and drag calculations. My swept wing glider was in the middle of both sets, not in the lead. What I can say is that the swept wing in actually more efficient in the way air flows past it at certain speeds, so though the drag may not be the best of the group, the air still flows over the wing in a smoother way, creating less backwash and turbulence past the wing, which allowed it to fly the furthest and actually beat the commercial glider.

The Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

An experimental campaign was undertaken to develop a low-dose and low-cost Active Interrogation system for Special Nuclear Material interrogation of Cargo Containers. The resulting system that was developed constitutes one of the lowest dose, highest sensitivity, interrogation systems reported. Time Spectrum data from NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors is presented that validates the presence of small quantities of U235 in samples using a low dose Deuterium-Deuterium Fusion Neutron Source. Also presented is the development of novel Cherenkov Effect based Gamma and Neutron Detectors for use in Passive scanning systems for Weapons Grade Plutonium (WGPu), as well as to compliment the Active Interrogation system developed here for Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU). The resulting Portal Monitor developed from this campaign, is consumer and environmentally friendly, cost effective, and significantly more sensitive than systems currently deployed.

CHARACTERIZING THE SPECTRAL AND FLOW CHARACTERISTICS OF MICROHOLLOW CATHODE DISCHARGES
Kamal Shah
Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School, Jersey City, NJ

Plasma is the fourth state of matter and consists of a high-energy, gaseous mixture of molecules, ions, and electrons. Microhollow cathode discharges (MHCD) are room-temperature micro-plasma that can be used to replace spark plugs in engines and as non-invasive, pain-free alternatives in root canal procedures. Unfortunately, the basic properties of MHCD are still not well-studied, especially those of stable MHCD made from a mixture of gases.<br><br> I studied the basic fluid flow of multiple-gas MHCD by determining the Reynolds Number, which describes whether the plasma flow is laminar or turbulent. I also characterized the species that were produced at the surface of the discharge by analyzing the spectra of the emitted light.<br><br> I observed that the plasma discharge interacted heavily with the atmosphere and produced various high-energy species, including free radicals, ozone, and atomic oxygen. However, because oxygen is such a reactive species, too much oxygen hindered the amount of reactive species produced. Moreover, I observed that electrons excited noble gas atoms (helium and argon) and were ultimately accepted by diatomic oxygen.<br><br> There were many trends observed in the fluid flow of the plasma discharge, specifically that the Reynolds Number — and therefore, turbulence — of the discharge was a linear function of the gas flow rate, an exponential function of the concentration of the densest gas, and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional diameter of the discharge.

THE CLOSE BINARY FRACTION: A BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SDSS M DWARF SPECTRA
Benjamin Mathias Clark
Penn Manor High School, Millersville, PA

I have used cross-correlation to determine radial velocities from 145,888 individual spectra of a magnitude-limited sample of 39,543 M dwarfs observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). I then used Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the close binary fraction of M dwarfs. While previous results on the close binary fraction were based upon very small samples and thus were unable to provide very precise values, the results that I present here are based on far larger samples, and are thus more precise and fit to serve as a constraint on proposed theories of star formation. After adjusting for my detection efficiency, I found the frequency of binary stars with a<0.4 AU to be 3.1+.6-.9%. I also demonstrated that the close binary fraction, like the total binary fraction, decreases with decreasing primary mass.

POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF SUPERORDER SELACHIMORPHA (SHARK) CHARACTERISTICS IN MARINE INDUSTRY
Sophia Myers
Cordova Jr-Sr High School, Cordova, AK

Due to a lack of clarity relating to the original condition of the dogfish, the following edit has been made:<br><br>In order to determine the relative amount of drag acting upon the design of sharks and submarines, a small-scale example of each was attached to a force sensor and dragged behind a small watercraft at speeds ranging from 0-5 feet per second. The submarine analog was constructed using a foam core, fishing weights along the belly to simulate ballast, and a covering of play-doh, which was then coated with latex paint to accurately replicate the hull coating of submarines. Due to the innate complexity of the shark form, an analog was not constructed. Instead, a preserved spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) was used. The results were analyzed, leading to the conclusion that the submarine analog experienced approximately 30% more resistance on average-a consistent .2 Newtons-than the spiny dogfish. This finding would indicate the possibility that a large-scale submarine that followed the form and surface of a shark would be more efficient than a traditional form, and deserves further investigation. A submarine covered with such a coating would also be difficult to detect on sonar, due to the variety of angles composing the demal denticle scales, making this a sound defensive investment. In addition, a sharkskin coating on the hull of surface vessels will probably serve to reduce drag and thus energy use and fuel consumption.

ISOLATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE RADIAL ELECTRIC FIELD FOR THE PROTON ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENT EXPERIMENT
Sahir Raoof
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

Identification of an electric dipole moment (EDM) may explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. This study aimed to solve two challenges faced during the proton EDM experiment: to differentiate the effects of a radial electric field (REF) from a residual magnetic field (RMF) on a particle’s spin precession and to improve efficiency of high voltage plate conditioning to decrease potential electrical breakdown. Geometric phase analysis was used to model spin precession of protons under varying conditions (ie. direction of circulation, initial spin orientation, varying field strength). The slope of the vertical spin precession under the RMF was negated, circulating clockwise versus counterclockwise; while precession under the REF remained the same. A LabView UI collected and assessed data from the high voltage test chamber during spark conditioning procedures. Spark conditioning plates at 500 microns was achieved, protecting plates from high, damaging voltages, improving traditional plate conditioning methods. Resolution of these challenges will allow for the detection of an EDM sensitive to 10^-29 e•cm, 100 times stronger than theoretical predictions. Future studies include glow discharge treatments, high pressure water jet cleaning procedures, and sextupole plates to increase proton spin coherence time. This will improve experimental sensitivity of a proton EDM, potentially explaining the matter-antimatter imbalance of the universe.

THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON SURFACE TENSION
Nikki Michelle White
Windsor High School, Windsor, VT

The problem studied in this project was the effects of different temperatures on the surface tension of water. Before the actual experiment, it was hypothesized that as temperature increases, surface tension will decrease. This hypothesis was formed due to the fact that temperature directly affects the particles in a liquid. Particles at higher temperatures move at greater speeds and can escape the water’s surface more easily. To complete the experiment, the first step was to create a balance. A needle was hung at one end of the balance and a square pan made from tinfoil was hung at the other. The needle was submerged into a cup filled with water. Using an eyedropper, drops of water were added to the tinfoil pan. The number of drops were counted until the needle was pulled up and out from the water. After completing five trials for four different water temperatures and gathering all the data, mathematical calculations were used to solve for surface tension in Newtons per meter and a graph was created. The graph showed that as temperature increased, surface tension decreased. From these results, it can be concluded that temperature does have an effect on surface tension.

A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FUTURE COSMIC STAR FORMATION RATE
Harrison Hugh Gaebler
Bloomington High School North, Bloomington, IN

The rate at which the cosmic star formation rate [SFR(z)] will decrease in the future is unknown. I hypothesized that the SFR(z) will decrease superlinearly because low-mass stars form at a higher rate and live longer than high-mass stars. Thus, nuclear material will be redistributed into low-mass stars at an increasing rate. The hypothesis was proved through observational data and mathematical analysis extrapolated from the past SFR(z).<br><br>First, I used the algorithm, GALFIT, to fit nineteen galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Then, I calculated a bulge-to-total luminosity ratio for each galaxy and graphed the ratios as a function of their respective galaxies’ SFRs. This confirmed that the SFR is lower in environments where most nuclear material is contained in low-mass stars.<br><br>Second, conceptualizing star formation as an iterative process allowed me to use two Taylor series to model a function describing SFR(z) history in order to investigate the rate of SFR(z) decrease in the future. I showed that the function converges superlinearly using the ratio test and the definition of convergence rate. Then, by the q-convergence definition, I found the minimum order, q, with which the convergence will occur.<br><br>The derivation of the minimum correct value for q creates a way to investigate the future changes in the SFR(z) from a mathematical standpoint. Specifically, as a result of this project we now know that the SFR(z) must converge to zero with at least order q, meaning that the minimum rate of future SFR(z) decrease is no longer unknown.

USING A SCANNING NEAR-FIELD OPTICAL MICROSCOPE TIP: WHAT SETTINGS WILL EXCITE PLASMONS MOST EFFICIENTLY?
Thomas Christopher Ovestad
Saint Olav School, Stavanger, Rogaland, NORWAY

For decades physicists have been working on developing new ways of transmitting information, which could replace the role of electrical wires. An emerging candidate is the excitation of an electron-density wave (Surface Plasmon Polariton or SPP). Directing light with special properties towards a metal-dielectric interface will excite a SPP propagating along the interface, potentially acting as the current flowing through an electric wire in an electric system.<br><br>Focusing on the SPP excitation using a Scanning Near-field Optical Microscope (SNOM) tip, three variables affecting the electron-density wave amplitude or excitation efficiency where identified as: the wavelength of the incident light, the distance between SNOM tip (D) and the interface and the diameter of the SNOM tip aperture.<br><br>Undertaking Lumerical software simulations employing Maxwell’s equations, the optimal settings were found by manipulating the three variables. Excitation efficiency was highest for incident light wavelengths of 700 nm and 800 nm and any attempt of excitation using wavelengths less than 600 nm were subject to considerable damping. Optimal values of D and aperture diameter were found to be functions of the incident wavelengths. The optimal ranges were found to be 100 nm – 150 nm for the aperture diameter, and 50 nm – 100 nm for D. The simulations will prove useful defining settings in further experimentation of SPP excitation using SNOM tips.<br><br>The energy efficiency of the SPP excitation method using a SNOM tip remains minute: around 2%; future applications in optical computer processors are nevertheless imaginable.

DETECTION OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES IN THE RADON DECAY CHAIN USING A HOMEMADE ION CHAMBER
Lois Therese Gagnon
Gagnon Family Homeschool, Goodrich, MI

In the previous year’s project, a cloud chamber had been used to detect the presence of radiation from different items, but was unable to quantify these emissions. The purpose of this year’s project was to construct and test an ion chamber to determine if it could detect radiation being emitted by certain items and relatively quantify these emissions. The ion chamber, constructed out of common electronic components and steel cans, was also used to detect radon present in a home and being produced by construction materials. Sources of radiation or radon were placed near the ion chamber. When radioactive particles were emitted by the items, they caused a current to flow through the ion chamber, which could be detected and quantified.<br><br> The ion chamber was able to indicate the presence of radon gas produced by radium paint on a clock by detecting the decay of radon progeny gathered by a dust collector. When the ion chamber was used in this manner to test for radon in a home, it was unable to indicate radon present in the areas tested, either because there was not enough radon produced or because the ion chamber was not sensitive enough to detect it. A granite counter and bricks were also tested to determine if they were sources of radon. The ion chamber did not indicate the presence of radon being produced by these items, either because there was no appreciable amount or because the ion chamber was not sensitive enough to detect it.

FINDING HARMONICS IN PLASMA
Dylan Edward Moore
Alameda Community Learning Center, Alameda, CA

Electroluminescent tubes ionized at a high frequency demonstrate a distinct beading pattern characterized by bright, equally spaced plasma beads, or oscillations. The project’s purpose was to discover what causes this phenomenon and to predict oscillation spacing by comparing its relationship to gas pressure and tube diameter. Glass tubes 50cm long with diameters of 6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm, 15mm and 20mm were evacuated and backfilled with neon at pressures of 5torr, 10torr, 13torr, 15torr, 20torr, 25torr, 30torr and 35torr. Each tube of gas was ionized separately with the same transformer and photographed. Using the digital images, the distances between the plasma oscillations were measured and analyzed. The plasma oscillations were found to be the visible result of plasma behaving sympathetically to a standing wave produced by out of phase 25kHz electromagnetic pulses coming from the opposing electrodes. The plasma bead centers coincided with the antinodes of this standing wave and distances between them were used to find Ln, the wavelength of the nth harmonic. The frequency of the nth harmonic, fn, was found to fit a model based on harmonic motion equations in which Ln is a function of pressure and tube diameter. Statistical analysis of the data was used to find the equation:<br><br>Ln=(-0.0734)(P)+(0.5631)(D)+5.9029 which directly relates Ln to pressure (P) and diameter (D) and which produces relatively accurate projections. Vlasov-Maxwell equations were looked at as way for modeling the behavior of the plasma waves in higher dimensions. The demonstrated tendency of plasma to self-organize differently under various boundary conditions could be important to Tokamak design for nuclear fusion.

TESTING A NONLINEAR-OSCILLATOR NEURON MODEL WITH OPTICAL ILLUSIONS
Sara Kornfeld Simpson
Patrick Henry High School, San Diego, CA

A new physical framework of perception based on modeling neurons as nonlinear oscillators has recently been used to explain the stroboscopic Wagon Wheel Illusion. This project tested the hypothesis that this model and framework could be extended to a second illusion, the Missing Fundamental Illusion, essentially testing if the Missing Fundamental Illusion tends to support or contradict this theory that neurons are nonlinear oscillators. <br><br> Initial tests verified that the Wagon Wheel Illusion and Missing Fundamental Illusion could be presented in the same, circular format. These tests involved both computer graphics presentations of four images (two based on the Wagon Wheel Image, and two based on the Missing Fundamental picture) as well as physical presentations using spinning wheels (optical choppers) and stroboscopic illumination. These tests also verified that the Missing Fundamental Illusion was still present, even with uneven spokes.<br><br> Finally, a series of tests were performed where the ratio of the stroboscopic period and the image repetition period was varied. The data from these tests confirmed that, like the Wagon Wheel Illusion images, the Missing Fundamental images displayed the illusion over discrete ranges of the ratio of periods that fit the new framework based on nonlinear oscillators, in agreement with the hypothesis. The Missing Fundamental Illusion itself was most clearly present at a small range surrounding and including the 1:4 and other even denominator ratios. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Missing Fundamental Illusion does support this new model and theory.

EXTENDING THE MOTIONAL STARK EFFECT DIAGNOSTIC TO LOW MAGNETIC FIELDS: TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING A LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUE
Nicole Yeechi Tsai
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

The Motional Stark Effect (MSE) diagnostic is a reliable and commonly used technique for obtaining plasma pitch-angle profiles and the safety factor q. However, at low magnetic fields, such as in the NSTX fusion reactor, overlap of spectral lines caused by line broadening can compromise readings. To extend the capabilities of the MSE diagnostic to as low as 0.05 T, a laser induced-fluorescence method was used to reduce the effective line width. In this method, a laser is used to excite a particular transition within the neutral hydrogen beam (n=2 to n=3), and the emitted light, or fluorescence, is measured. Successful operation of the neutral beam source was demonstrated and the laser emission was narrowed to an appropriate line width for the diagnostic. The neutral beam source was found to have an optimal activating pressure of 30-40 mTorr of hydrogen gas, with an rf of at least 500 applied. The emission from the laser diode bars had a line width within 0.01 nm and approximately 89% of the total power was within the narrow-line emission. Thus, the laser line width was effectively narrowed and centered at the appropriate corresponding Doppler wavelength of 650.76 nm. By configuring the beam source and laser diode, this research aided the development of implementing a laser-induced fluorescence technique to extend the capabilities of the Motional Stark Effect diagnostic to low magnetic fields. Ultimately, areas of instability within a low field fusion reactor were identified and this can help fusion energy to become a viable fuel source for the future.

THE MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOR OF KF3- AND ITS RELEVANCE TO 41CA ANALYSIS
Michael Thomas Lemanski
Royal St. George's College, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA

Measured with an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS), the long-lived isotope 41Ca is an effective medical tracer capable of measuring bone resorption. Currently, only large high-energy AMS systems are used, as they are needed to eliminate 41K contamination. The use of certain anions could, however, provide a simple low-cost alternative. Examination of MF_n^– superhalogen anions (where n = maximum valance (k) + 1) as well as related anions (where n > k + 2) have shown that superhalogens have high electron affinities and are strongly bound, while their relatives also have high electron affinities but are structurally weaker. Of these anions, the 41CaF_3^– and 41KF_3^– are of particular interest. Thus far, no method has been found to adequately remove 41KF_3^– contamination. Recently, 41KF_3^– was found to disappear at low gas pressures in an AMS. This project sought to determine if the disappearance was due to collision-induced disassociation (CID), as is suggested by theory, and whether an increase in pressure would improve 41KF_3^– attenuation.<br><br>The experiment utilized an AMS system to measure changes from gas-ion interactions in an Ar-filled chamber. The abundance of 41CaF_3^–, 41KF_3^– and 41KF_2^–, a product of CID, were measured at ~4.0×10^–5 Pa and ~3.0×10^–3 Pa. The experiment confirmed the expected CID of 41KF_3^– at a rate of 79%, but also registered a 69% loss of 41CaF_3^–. Although this method of removing isobaric contamination was shown to be impractical, these results demonstrate that theoretical descriptions can be considered a reliable guide in further research.

A PILOT STUDY TO DEVELOP AN OPTICAL DIODE BASED ON THE THUE-MORSE SEQUENCE
Kevin Most
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

An optical diode was developed based on Kerr nonlinearity, using quantum dots, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride. Biancalana (2008) used Kerr nonlinear polymers to develop an optical diode. This research preserves many of the previous work's parameters but, in place of Kerr nonlinear polymers, uses the inexpensive semiconductors silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, and quantum dots as a Kerr nonlinear element. The structure was developed and tested using FullWAVE, an optical simulation program utilizing the FDTD algorithm. The structure was then fabricated using PECVD and spin-coating on a glass substrate. Following fabrication, the structure was tested by firing pulses from a 532nm laser through both directions and testing transmitted power. The structure exhibited 20-25% nonreciprocal transmission at 1000mW of 532nm light, and the effect was intensity-dependent. At lower pulse powers, the difference in the amount of light transmission through the structure in both directions was less than 1mW. This is in accordance with the expected results, as the Kerr nonlinear mechanism increases a material's refractive index based on light intensity. As a result, at lower pulse powers, the structure exhibited almost no nonreciprocal effects. However, there was a clear disparity in the power transmitted through the structure in both directions at higher pulse powers. Though a fifth-order Thue-Morse structure was utilized in the current work, future research is being conducted regarding the presence of this effect in Distributed Bragg Reflectors containing quantum dots, and whether the effect could be maximized by utilizing higher-order Thue-Morse structures.

LIGHT SPEED II
Ben Luke Schuler
Wishek Public School, Wishek, ND

The purpose of my project was to see if temperature affects the speed of light through different media.<br><br>My hypothesis was that as the temperature of media went from higher to lower, the index of refraction will be higher, due to the density of the media. Therefore, I think light will pass through warmer faster than colder media.<br><br>A laser measuring system was designed using a cardboard box, laser pointer, and graph paper. Three angle measurements were taken for each of the nine media at three different temperature of 78 measurements (dish soap could not be measured at cold temperature). The angle of refraction was then measured for each medium. Snell's Law was used to determine the index of refraction. The speed of light was then determined.<br><br>According to my experiment, light traveled through the media faster at warmer temperatures compared to cooler temperatures. I expected this because as a substance becomes colder, it becomes denser. As proved in my seventh grade project, density affects the speed of light. This appeared more readily in the oils and corn syrup, probably because they are thicker at room temperature and become thinner when heated and more dense when cooled. The media such as water and vinegar did not show as much variance.<br><br>My results do support my hypothesis. Light passed through the media at the warmest temperature the fastest and the coldest temperature the slowest. I found the greater the temperature, the greater the speed of light.

POSITRONS: ELEMENT OF DARK MATTER
Michael Anthony Labbe
Notre Dame High School, Chattanooga, TN

If we ever want to take a far larger step forward into magnitudes of energy, then we must look beyond what is current and possibly beyond our planet, Earth. The universe may hold keys to energy sources beyond today’s understanding. My project is meant to focus on one of the elements of Dark Matter (positrons) in our universe which could hold keys to magnitudes of clean energy in the future if we can only learn to harness it.<br><br>In the development of my project, I needed to find a source that would shoot hot electrons at a high z material. In nature, gamma rays are found in our atmosphere during lightning storms. I replicated a lightning strike with a hot electron spark gap generator that would excite my high z material, gold. When the hot electrons are fired at the gold atom, they lose energy as they interact with the nuclei of a gold atom. After the hot electrons lose their energy, high energy photons are formed which annihilate with the protons of the gold atom’s nuclei spinning off pairs of positrons and electrons. From there, the positrons can be channeled effectively within a large magnetic field to the negative side (positive charge) where they can be detected by tungsten metal. <br><br>Hypothesis: Positrons can be generated, directed, and measured as an energy source through the process of using an electric ark flash to excite the gold nuclei, a catalyst for positron production. <br><br> The purpose of my project is to better our understanding of the universal elements of space. Positrons and their function could be the building blocks of a future energy source currently housed in dark matter. I found that, as I was testing, the electron spark gap generator did work close to the same magnitude as a laser would except on a lower scale. My tests showed that my highest reading was .07 DC volts, but I also performed several tests that would validate that I was actually producing positrons and not anything else. These tests included a test without the gold piece, with the reactor section reversed, and with the reactor section removed from the magnetic field. In conclusion, one may accept the stated hypothesis.

EFFECTS OF CATHODE COMPOSITION ON INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTORS
Charles Douglas Ramey
Northgate High School, Newnan, GA

Inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusion reactors are traditionally equipped with an ion accelerating cathode grid crafted out of highly conductive metals as to provide optimal thermal and electrical conductivity. Although these designs are effective at producing neutrons, their efficiency is not high enough for power generation. The high energy conditions that the cathode grids often operate in consequently produce a significant yield of both secondary and thermionically emitted electrons. The electron yields subtract from the optimal acceleration energies by requiring a higher level of power draw, which equates to a large margin of efficiency losses within IEC fusion reactors.<br><br> Presented is a novel change to the traditional grid materials implemented in IEC fusion reactors, engineered to improve overall reactor efficiency by reducing both thermionic and secondary electron emission from the cathode grid. Titanium is often a common material used in the cathode grids of IEC reactors due to its properties of hydrogen storage and high conductivity. While titanium often produces high neutron yields, at somewhat efficient levels, this experiment sought to find the best compromise between conductivity and lowest possible atomic number, of which titanium was not. By implementing a cathode grid with lesser atomic density than that of titanium, thermionic and secondary emissions will be reduced; as a result plasma density will increase, power draw will decrease, and efficiency will increase. By changing the grid to a material nearly half as dense as titanium coated with an even less dense material, x-ray emission was reduced by 29900% reactor efficiency was increased 900%.

LASER CUSHION: THE SUPPRESSION OF ASE IN SOLID STATE LASERS
Brian Paul Ludewig
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this project is to suppress Amplified Spontaneous Emission, or ASE, while achieving maximum gain in a solid state Nd: YAG laser. The industry standard involves the use of a glass flow tube doped with a reflective rare Earth metal, like Barium Sulfate. This project integrated Barium Sulfate and Samarium Oxide into the pump reflector, which eliminated the need for the fragile, doped glass flow tube. Instead, a more durable, cheaper fused Silica tube was used. The Barium Sulfate and Samarium Oxide were weighed and mixed in the following gradients to serve as variables: 100% Barium Sulfate, 100% Samarium Oxide, 50% Barium Sulfate/ 50% Samarium Oxide, 75% Barium Sulfate/ 25% Samarium Oxide, 25% Barium Sulfate/ 75% Samarium Oxide. These variables were tested for absorption and reflectivity at the US Army Night-Vision Lab, and gain testing was performed using an Nd: YAG laser. The lab results concluded that although Samarium Oxide was highly reflective and absorbed ASE well, it did not produce the high gain necessary for this specific laser application.

The frequency of LED light is same as that of this sound. This LED light is synchronized with rotating lines, we can see a fringe is stop. According to this stroboscope principle, the frequency of sound is known accurately. There are three contents. All contents are used stroboscope principle. <br><br>First, violin tuner was invented. The stroboscope disk for violin tuner has four ring. And each ring has proper lines which corresponds to it's frequency. This violin tuner is more faster and accurate than an electronic tuner. <br><br>Second, sympathetic vibrato was investigated. This method is known by using a second over tone. The vibrato was done very fast, normally 5times/sec. In order to measure a frequency change of vibrato sound, spectrum analyzer is not proper due to low response time. By using stroboscope, the frequency change of sympathetic vibrato was observed evidently. <br><br>Third, string vibration was investigated. In string instrument, there are fundamental tone and several over tones. Where does over tone generate from? For this purpose, I used same stroboscope principle. But, the technique is different. I used the frequency of LED strobo light is multiple times of that of sound. To analyse the photo under strobo light, it was shown that fundamental mode vibrates together with several over modes. <br><br>In conclusion, stroboscope technique is very useful to investigate a repeated movement, for example a music acoustics.

Advanced Education and Science Center of the Moscow State University, Moscow, RUSSIA

The purpose of the investigation was to study the process of “domino effect” and to develop the scheme that allows using "domino effect" for energy cumulation when small energy of separate domino chains is collected in one point. Then the cumulated large energy can be used where needed. Such approach allows to avoid using one powerful or massive device as “energy accumulator” and to use insignificant initial effort for the huge final effect. <br><br>The "common" domino effect was investigated. The video of the falling domino chain was made using the high-speed camera. The dependence of the falling domino wave velocity on the domino parameters, such as material, the distance between elements, increasing and decreasing masses, was measured. The theory of the process was developed, allowing essential parameters to vary in wide range. The program for computer modeling was created.<br><br> <br><br>The falling time of different nonlinear elements’ layouts (stairs, arcs, spirals, forks, etc) was investigated. The results were used in construction of the final installation.<br><br> <br><br>The final scheme of cumulate effect demonstration was developed and constructed. This scheme uses separation and convergence of falling domino waves. During this process the energy concentrates and can be used in "domino impact". The dependence of the impact power on the dominoes parameters was measured.<br><br> <br><br>Possibility of using cumulate domino effect for creation of the remarkable power impact was confirmed by the experiment. Calculations were made to arrange optimal domino layouts to achieve the definite impact force.

The scanning electron microscope analysis showed that the surface resembled a “field” of “nano-grass”. Every grass leaf consisted of many long nano-crystalline whiskers tightly combined in bunches. Depending on the conditions of the experiment, the height of the bunches varied from 1 to 10 μm, and the thickness of the bunches was 100-500 nm. The diameter of cylindrical whiskers in the bunches was 20-40 nm.<br><br>Besides usual bunches of whiskers, dendrite structures were also observed. It was noticed that the dendrite structure, as well as other uncommon structures, were formed on impurities .<br><br>The results show that this technology is possible to use instead of more labor-consuming and more expensive after the sufficiently careful investigation of the dependence of the crystallites sizes on experimental conditions

MEASURING THE PASSAGE OF TIME FOR BODIES AT RELATIVISTIC SPEEDS WITH DYNAMIC ACCELERATIONS
Michael Owen Flynn
Maui High School, Kahului, HI

The special and general theories of relativity, as developed by Albert Einstein in his famous papers, have been extremely successful in describing deviations from Newtonian physics when objects gain speeds comparable to that of light. Embedded within the complex mathematical formulations of these theories are a number of concepts which help scientists immeasurably in the process of calculating relative quantities; one such concept is that of proper time.<br><br>Typically, proper time is defined formally within special relativity by the time coordinate introduced in Minkowskian 4-space. Through the use of elementary relativistic analysis, this paper is the first to define an alternative version of proper time, making use of the three temporal coordinates of the Minkowski metric to achieve a new expression for calculating relative quantities. We prove that this formulation is more effective than its time-based counterpart in terms of mathematical efficiency within a variety of cases; additionally, it is shown that use of this particular mode of calculation is extremely effective in problems where a variable acceleration must be taken into account. This demonstrates a new method of approaching accelerated reference frames within the context of special relativity. We apply this result to a number of classic examples from special relativity to confirm its accuracy, in addition to proving that these solutions reduce to simple Newtonian mechanics at low velocities. We then further demonstrate the advantages of this new definition by examining a situation which special relativity would traditionally fail to obtain a solution for.

COLLISION COURSE: 4486 MITHRA
Omkar Vikas Joshi
Bellaire Senior High School, Bellaire, TX

Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) jeopardize Earth due to their relatively small minimum orbit intersection distances. 4486 Mithra is classified as a PHA, and with only 436 observations, is one of the less observed asteroids. This project consists of an orbital determination and impact risk analysis for 4486 Mithra. It determines the threat level on the Torino Scale and explores options to mitigate the risk. Using a remote telescope, five sets of images were collected. The Least Squares Plate Reduction method was used to calculate the right ascension and declination of the asteroid. The Gaussian Method of Orbit Determination was employed to solve for the orbital elements. A set of 729 asteroids was generated within the error margin and run through an N-body numerical integrator to map out the gravitational keyhole. The initial run resulted in an impact risk of 28.67% in 4.087282 years. The light curve calculation determined the rotational period of 89.5 days. Changing the rotational period would change the path of the asteroid, thus reducing the impact risk. To reduce error propagation, a differential correction would have been most useful, but six observations would be required while only five were available. Instead, the data structure in the Gaussian Method program was changed, resulting in a decrease in the error margin. The impact risk was reduced to 0% with a “no hazard” designation on the Torino Scale after executing the N-body numerical integrator once more. Thus, it was determined that 4486 Mithra poses no impact risk for Earth.

SUPER SAWDUST: YOU WARM UP MY LIFE!

What is the best jacket filler that could absorb and retain the most amount of heat?<br><br> <br><br> Parallel investigations were conducted by comparing the different jacket filler’s ability to absorb and retain heat, as to reduce the dependency on the use of heater during winter. The microwave oven emits radiation like a human body as the source of heat. We used polyester, cotton, animal fur, feathers, wool, sawdust, and air (control variable) as jacket fillers.

MATHEMATICALLY MODELLING CAPILLARY RISE
Ujwal Chadha
Del Norte High School, Albuquerque, NM

Capillary rise the rise of liquids in capillary tubes due to surface tension. Research in the past has mainly concentrated on short-time capillary rise (times less than 5 seconds) and making improvements on the Lucas-Washburn equation (L-W equation). Since the L-W equation does not include the gravity term, it predicts an infinite rise height- which is impractical and false. In this research, an extended solution is found including the gravity term and is compared to experimental data. Capillary tubes of radii (0.523837 mm) were inserted in liquids of various viscosities (water, 3 M Sulfuric acid, and 6 M Sulfuric acid) and were recorded on video. Videos were analyzed in Logger Pro®. It was found that the extended gravity solution more closely models the behavior of capillary rise than the more often used L-W equation in both short and long-times. Curve fitting done in MATLAB® further showed that the Lambert W function in the extended gravity solution more closely models capillary rise than the square root function in the L-W equation. Thus, the extended gravity solution is a viable and useful equation for modeling capillary rise. This research has possible applications in earth sciences.

BLACK WIDOW VS. ORB WEAVER; EXTRACTING THE DIFFERENCE
Caitlin Ann Redak
John W. North High School, Riverside, CA

Orb weaver spiders (Araneus spp.) build webs out in the open subject to the elements and that are often in the paths of other animals. On the other hand, black widows (Latrodectus hesperus) build dense webs close to the ground in secluded places away from the elements. In addition, the geometry of the construction is different between the two. In my project I compared the breaking and tensile strengths of spider web silk from each of these species to determine if one silk was stronger. I hypothesized that the orb weaver silk would have a higher tensile and breaking strength in comparison to the black widow silk. I found no relationship between tensile strength and the length of the silk suggesting tensile strength is a physical property of the silk regardless of length. However larger spiders in both species tend to have a weaker tensile strength because larger spiders produce silk of a larger diameter. I also found that orb weavers have a slightly smaller diameter and thus a higher tensile strength than black widows. I could not accept my hypothesis that breaking strength was higher in orb weavers than black widows because they were not statistically different for a given length. I found evidence for my hypothesis that orb weavers had a higher tensile strength than black widows.

LIGHT CURVE AND ORBITAL ANALYSIS OF AMOR ASTEROID 2000NF5
Weishuang Linda Xu
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

The purpose of this project was to ascertain whether the asteroid 2000NF5 would be a suitable target for spacecraft missions.Observations were taken almost nightly from 9.14.10-11.13.10 in 80s exposures through V bands. After subtracting bias and flat frames, astrometry was done using stars from the USNO A2.0 catalog in a least squares plate reduction. 3 points were used in a Gaussian orbit determination using the 4th expansion of f and g series. Orbital data was run through Swift.RMVS3 to assess precession for 200Myr. Photometric data was obtained using reference stars in USNO A2.0 and standard Landolt THPE stars taken on the same night. Corrections for phase angles, nightly extinction, and air mass were applied. A light curve was plotted using 323 points. 2000NF5 has a semi-major axis of 2.21 AU, eccentricity of 0.441, inclination of 1.31º,longitude of ascending node of 282.5º, argument of periapsis of 8.9º, and time of periapsis of 2455364.6637 JD. Its rotational period is 59.3h with amplitude of 0.8137, and absolute magnitude of 16 yields a diameter estimate of 1.68-3.75 km. If we follow the triaxial ellipsoid model with axis a, b, and c (a > b > c) and assume it to be rotating about axis c, the axis ratio a:b is found to be 2.116 ignoring variations in amplitude due to phase change,suggesting that NF5 has a highly elongated shape. However this is assuming both the model and a uniform albedo. This asteroid has a volatile orbit due to mean-motion resonance with Jupiter in the 2/7 Kirkwood gap, but violent changes are distant. In conclusion; NF5 is a sizable slow rotator with a low inclination which makes it accessible; moderate eccentricity makes it an interesting target. However, much more data must gathered: NF5 has not yet been named nor is its SMASII class known.

THE EFFECTS OF IONIZATION ON SPARK ENERGY CONTENT
Tucker Leavitt, Samuel Kater, 
Animas High School, Durango, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the nature of sparks and the effects that the ionization process by which sparks travel through the air has on spark energy content. We posed the question: Is there an increase in the electrical energy of a spark due to the process by which sparks travel through the air? How do the distance that the spark travels and the dielectric properties of the gas that the spark ionizes affect the change in electrical energy? To conduct our experiment, we constructed a Marx generator, an electrical circuit capable of generating high voltage pulses suitable for creating sparks As opposed to the Tesla coil we used in our previous experiments, our Marx generator does not emit radio waves, which allowed us to quantify the energies (i.e. the voltage and current) of the sparks it generated more accurately using an oscilloscope. Testing our first variable, spark gap length, involved a similar process to last year's experimental procedure; we adjusted the distance between the anode and cathode of the spark gap and took measurements at either side of the gap. The ratio of output to input power was measured to be greater than one for certain spark gap lengths. To test our second variable (the gas ionized), we obtained a vacuum pump and chamber and inserted the anode and cathode. We then obtained samples of nitrogen, helium, and argon and measured the electrical energies of sparks fired through relatively pure concentrations of the above inert gases and a near vacuum. Both the input and output energies of all these sparks were less than that of sparks fired through air, suggesting that the increase in output energy observed in our first experiment is attributed to the ionization of atmospheric gases with lower breakdown voltages.

THE DESK MODEL OF A MULTILAYER MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLE
Grigory Astretsov, Lev Yurovsky, 
Lyceum # 40, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhegorodskaya, RUSSIA

Interest in multilayer magnetic nanostructures increases rapidly because of the opportunity to create electronic devices – for instance, memory storage gadgets – with a very high density of recorded data. It is unnecessary to use complicated quantum models of nanoparticles when one creates such devices with desired properties to predict their behavior. Instead we can use a simple generic system composed of macroscopic magnetic dipoles. <br><br>Our project is devoted to experimental and theoretical studies of equilibrium states with noncollinear distribution of magnetic moments in the system of three magnetic needles. The magnetic states of this system are similar to the states of nanostructures and are determined by three key parameters: dipole lengths, their magnetic moments, and the distance between these dipoles. <br><br>For experimental part of our study a special mechanical design was invented. Magnetic needles were placed in a way that allowed them to rotate freely in parallel planes with precise control of the distance between them; misorientation angles that characterized magnetic states were measured. The dependences of the misorientation angles on key parameters have also been theoretically analyzed by minimization of magnetostatic energy. We determined the ranges of key parameters, which correspond to various magnetic states (antiferromagnetic state and different types of helicoidal ordering). In particular, we have observed unusual equilibrium states with unequal misorientation angles. Experimental results of our study coincide with theoretical ones and with up-to-date results of multilayer magnetic nanoparticles studies.

A LOW COST INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE THE THICKNESS OF THIN FILMS
Ali Yildirim, Atif Erdem, 
Isiklar Air Force High School, Bursa, TURKEY

In this research, a device using both transmission spectroscopy and refractive index to measure the thickness of thin films was developed. The device is relatively unexpensive and simple, and its origin is based on “thin-film interference” and uses optical reflection and transmission spectroscopy. After having completed the optical spectrometer system, the thickness of thin films were determined by counting fringes using it. Optical spectrometer measurements were carried out to determine the thickness, the wavelength dependence of the refractive index and optical absorption coefficient. While the optical constants were determined from the optical transmission measurements, we used the method described by Swanepoel and suggested by Lyashenko and Miloslavskii. This method is based on “envelope curve” that is drawn from maxima and minima points of optical transmission spectrums of the light coming to surface perpendicularly. We measured the thicknesses of TiO2, SiO2 thin films and Pasco’s semi-transparent mirror. The results obtained from the experiments were 1.104 μm for Pasco’s semi-transparent mirror, 0.364 μm for TiO2 film and 0.717 μm for SiO2 film. In order to compare our measurement results to a fabricated instrument, we made some calculations by using a profilometer. According to the experimental results, our system and profilometer system was compatible with each other.

STUDIES OF CELL ELASTICITY BY NONLINEAR DAMPING
Janet Yun-Chen Sung, Nai-Wen Hu, 
Taipei First Girls High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

The compartments of cell organization can frequently be associated to their adhesive and elastic properties. In this study, we investigate the bio-mechanical properties of zebrafish embryos through damping oscillations. We construct a homemade electromagnetic oscillator coupled to an optical lever to enhance the viscoselastic responses. This device allows us to extract the viscous damping coefficient and elasticity of cells in various stages of embryonic development, through nonlinear damping processes. The strain of the cell in each developing period can be obtained by measuring the alternations in the amplitudes of the damped oscillations. The elasticity of the zebrafish embryo in the blastula period is significantly lower than those of other periods, reflecting the reduction in the buffer resistance of the outer shell. A temporal exponent that indicates the growth rate of cell development can also be extracted from the nonlinear damping profile. This proper time of embryonic development is found to be noticeably different in each stage, which can be coupled to the changes in cell compartments. Modifications of the fluid compartments of the outer shell by emerging the embryo into solutions of slightly different pH values would significantly alter the oscillation profile. Surprisingly, the viscosity of the shell is extremely sensitive to the environment experienced.

TRANSMISSION HOLOGRAMS AND YOUNG MODULUS
Andre Alcada Fernades, Vitoria Robalo Esteves, Ana Luisa Rocha
Escola Secundaria Campos Melo, Covilha, PORTUGAL

Young Modulus is a measure used to characterize the stiffness of a certain material, when subjected to a force. By convention, the higher its value is, the more resistant the material is to deformation. The most common way to determine it, is by subjecting the body to a force and measure the modification of its dimensions. The main problem that one may face is that, normally, a metal requires a massive force in order to make the deformations perceptible. This can easily be solved, if one has a way to percept small deformations. That can be achieved using Holography.<br><br>Holography is a technique that allows the recording of images. In the case of Holographic Interferometry, that recording gives one the possibility of measuring the slightest translocations. In the research we conducted, we tried to calculate the Young Modulus of Aluminium, as well as to establish comparisons between the Young Modulus of different materials in a qualitative way, in order to check if this technique would be an appropriate substitute to the original method.<br><br>Holograms were recorded on an optical table in a dark chamber, and we varied the deformative force in each trial. After chemical treatment, results were analyzed by hand: the hologram images were reconstructed on a graph paper screen so that fringes distance was determined, and a linear regression was made to calculate the Young Modulus.<br><br>Although the qualitative measures proved to be reliable, the final result of the Young Modulus of Aluminium, (4.2±0.6)x10^7 Pa, was not the expected, being far behind from the tabulated one. We did, thus, conclude that this technique was not appropriate for a righteous measure, even though adequate for academic purposes.

MAGNETISM VS. TEMPERATURE
Jose Luis Mata, Juan Carlos Alonso, 
Dr. Leonides G. Cigarroa High School, Laredo, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to see how a magnet would react to a change in temperature. We hypothesized that if you increase the temperature of a magnet, its magnetism will decrease. In theory, the tight composition of a cooler object should have a stronger concentration of magnetism; therefore, improving its strength. The opposite is also true: when you heat up an object its molecules move further apart decreasing its magnetism. We manipulated the temperature of a magnet and monitored how it was affected. We alternated between heating up and then cooling down the magnet to see how many Bb pellets it could lift. Procedure: 1. Gather all materials 2. Pour Bb pellets into a bowl 3. Pass magnet directly over bowl 4. Count pellets lifted by magnet 5. Cool the magnet for 3 minutes 6. Repeat steps 2-4 7. Heat magnet for 3 minutes 8. Repeat steps 2-4 9. Repeat steps 2-8 with the remaining magnets. Our hypothesis was validated; the graph showed how the change in temperature affected the magnets' performance thus creating the inverse relationship. Our hypothesis was proven correct when the magnet did not perform as expected after heating, and supported when the magnets worked better after cooled off. The average number of pellets picked up by a magnet at room temperature was 281; cooled magnets picked an average of 311; and a heated magnet 243. This shows that when the magnet is cooled, its magnetism becomes stronger, and weaker with an increase of temperature.

OPTIMIZING THE DATA COLLECTION OF THE PROTON ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENT EXPERIMENT
Alina Ranjbaran, Andrew Rosen, 
Garden City Senior High School, Garden City, NY

Scientists theorize that, initially, matter and antimatter were originally in equal quantities. However, an asymmetry developed during the Big Bang that can be explained by a violation of the fundamental particle symmetries of charge and parity (CP-Violation). An electric dipole moment in a proton (pEDM) points to CP-Violation and is tested for in the pEDM experiment that is currently in the development phase. In this experiment, two beams of protons are injected into a ring with a position-determining polarimeter. Based on defined experimental parameters, programmed simulations were created in Python. The generated computer programs serve to simulate the polarization and vertical spin component of the proton beams, which can be utilized to calculate the position asymmetry of the detected particles. The presence of such an asymmetry is what signifies an EDM. Two different depolarization models were tested; the first, which assumed a parabolic depolarization, was concluded to be unrealistic due to an inconclusive signal-to-noise ratio. The second polarization model, which had a more gradual depolarization based on a decay function, is believed to be a more accurate model in verifying the predicted behaviors of the protons. After analyzing the statistical significance of the asymmetry results, a potential maximum beam lifetime for each model was calculated to optimize the experimental runtime and calculate when to inject a new beam of protons. This research can save millions of dollars for the experiment, allowing scientists to better observe the pEDM in an effort to explain the matter dominant universe.

MANIPULATING BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATE (BEC) BY IMMERSING ELECTRONS
Saud Mohammed Altamimi, Abdulrahman Linjawi, 
Jeddah Internationl School, Jeddah

Our project aims to theoretically investigate the effects of immersing cooled free electrons into a Rubidium Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) to form an exciton BEC within it. These exciton BECs can be regarded as a suitable host stable quantum computing as well as a quantum capacitor. We hypothesize that if, by theory, we are able to induce a cloud of electrons into the Rubidium condensate adiabatically without a reaction or depletion of the condensate, then we can theoretically manipulate the BEC ground states to perform (|0> and |1>) binary functions; host multi-qubit systems used for quantum computation; store large amounts of charge in the form of high voltage static electricity. In the future, we plan to construct these in quantum storage wells in atom chips to transfer electricity in high quantities as well as become source for storing charge and can be considered as a primary source of power for future quantum experiments.

THE EFFECT OF INCIDENCE OF MUONS AS COSMIC RAY DURING THE DAY OVER THE EARTH AND SOLAR FLARES
Kevin Vargas-Velez, Edrick Joel Alvarado-Rodriguez, 
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Cosmic rays interact with nuclei in Earth's atmosphere. Showers occur when these particles are extremely energetic, and produce large numbers of other particles, mostly pions. These particles are also known as secondary particles, because they decay from protons collisions into the muons that strike Earth's surface (Lochner, 2011). During a shower, thousands of these particles can strike an area as large as several square kilometers nearly simultaneously. Cosmic rays are energetic particles originated from the cosmos that then impinge on the Earth's atmosphere and cause cosmic ray air showers (NASA, 2010). <br><br>This research consisted of counting the amount of muons during the day and during the night. This data was collected by a muon detector located indoors at CROEM. This data was processed by e-lab at www18.i2u2.org/elab/cosmic. Once the system processed the data, a graph was plotted. The graph is based on the amount of muons collected by the detector in terms of Flux: (events/m^2/60-seconds).<br><br>This research determined if there is a relationship between solar flares and the incidence of muons as cosmic ray air showers. To prove this, it is required to establish and determine if there is a relationship between the Sun’s activity and the incidence of the muons as cosmic ray air showers. The results of this research indicated that there was a significant difference between the amount of muons during the day and during the night. It was also revealed that during a solar flare the amount of muons as cosmic ray air showers increases drastically.

QUASI-PERIODIC PHOTONIC CRYSTALS FOR MULTI-WAVELENGTH REFLECTORS AND EMITTERS
Indroneil Roy, Tanmai Shah, Sunny Aggarwal
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

A broadband omni-directional white light reflector has been designed using silicon based materials and the optical properties of quasi periodic structures. This mirror was designed using the Thue- Morse (a binary sequence and Rudin Shapiro sequences of Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) and Silicon Nitride (Si3N4). The passive structures are designed to reflect a broadband range of lambda values (440 to 490 nm for blue light, 520 to 570 nm for green light, and 625 to 750 nm for red light) with omnidirectionality. Thus, the structure will prove a better efficiency in enhancing photovoltaic/ solar panel cells due to the fact that a nano structure would be able to reflect a white light source at all angles. Consequently, when the 64- layer silicon substrate Thue-Morse passive structure was fabricated using PECVD (Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) system, it showed great reflectivity in its band gap structure among the chosen wavelength ranges. Also, the 64- layer silicon substrate Rudin-Shapiro passive structure showed great reflectivity peaks among the selected lambda values. Thus, the nano-structures have ascertained to be very useful and efficient for solar panels and photovoltaic cells.

LIGHT CURVE DIP ANALYSIS OF EXOPLANET SYSTEMS

Our experiment focused on testing to see if atmospheric viewing conditions have any effect on the Transit Energy Analysis method (TEA), which determines the area of a transit light curve. To isolate the variable of atmospheric viewing conditions, we used data of the same transit from two similar telescopes (Faulkes Telescope North / South). We researched a team using the Hubble Space Telescope and found that they have also performed photometry on our target star, HD189733b and came to the conclusion that no anomalies occur within the system. The values we came out with were the total light energy blocked (TEB) by the exoplanet. We calculated a percent difference of 3.1%, leading us to the conclusion that different atmospheric viewing conditions will have minimal effect on determining the area of transit light curves.<br><br> <br><br>Next we tested whether or not our TEA method provides evidence to detect extrasolar system anomalies when used in conjunction with the Transit Timing Variation method or TTV method. We chose the HAT-P-13 system and performed the TEA on HAT-P-13b. A recent paper has also suggested TTV’s of roughly 20 minutes occur, which suggest that there may have another component in the system. We then performed TEA on several observations and determined that changes in TEB in the system exceed a margin of more than 3.1%. We then had come to the conclusion that extrasolar anomalies exist within the HAT-P-13b system. Furthermore, we plan on extending our project by performing photometry on several other exoplanet systems.

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
Dylon J Merrell, Charley Adams, 
Meeker High School, Meeker, CO

The project Quantum Entanglement asks how photons interact in a Michelson Interferometer. We tested a classical model against two experimental variables. We studied interference patterns produced by sending a Type II helium neon laser through our Michelson Interferometer. We also measured light intensity with various polarizer assortments in the Michelson Interferometer. We compared our predictions from the classical model to the measured values of light intensity and found that three of the four predictions were outside standard error of the measured. We also found an interference pattern with an assortment of polarizers that should have canceled out the interference pattern in the classical model. This supports our hypothesis that photons do not behave classically in a Michelson Interferometer. We now plan to compile and test a Quantum model to determine whether we can accurately predict photon interaction with a Quantum model.

Infrared technology has recently become available to the average consumer. In this study, we designed and analyzed the process of constructing a cost-effective camera with infrared capabilities.<br><br> Commercial cameras are outfitted with infrared filters; without them, cameras can closely mimic “night vision” cameras. After removing the infrared filter, we installed one of three viable visible light filters: polarized film, fully exposed processed film, and partially exposed processed film. Lastly, we tested this modified camera by taking pictures with a device emitting infrared radiation and analyzed the detections. <br><br> We were able to affirm that our picture data was valid by using discrete Fourier transformations to eliminate other wavelengths and isolate the 940 nm wavelength emitted from our infrared source. Moreover, we analyzed the pictures with photo-editing software to obtain numerical light intensity from the pixels of our data. Through this, we discovered that the fully exposed processed film most efficiently blocked out visible light without losing picture quality. Polarized film lost focus, and partially exposed processed film incompletely absorbed visible light. <br><br> In addition to security purposes, this camera can be employed in car safety (identifying cars regardless of human eye visibility conditions), forensics (identification of counterfeit bills), military equipment (infrared scopes), hazardous conditions (rescue aid vision), and medical (visible veins and cardiovascular system monitoring). When infrared filters in cameras are replaced with films fully exposed to C-41 process, the cameras can see a greater range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and these versatile applications makes our camera cost-effective and attractive to consumers.

ESTIMATION OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD PARAMETERS FOR PARTICLES SUPERDEEP PENETRATION INTO THE TARGET

Municipal School No. 146, Perm, RUSSIA

The effect of superdeep penetration (SDP) of microparticles into a solid barrier was discovered in 1974. Many hypotheses to explain this effect were suggested since that time but none of them has not yet been proven. <br><br> The purpose of this study was the analysis of the results of the experiment on SDP of silicon carbide particles in a steel cylindrical rod and estimation of the parameters of the electromagnetic field. The main hypothesis was that studied field had a high volumetric energy density. To measure this field the following setup was used: X-ray film was turned around a steel rod with a slot, the film was also inserted into the slot, the rod was placed in a steel cylindrical protective container. The silicon monocrystal was attached to the bottom rod edge. The SiC particles were injected to the upper rod edge with the explosion. With their penetration into the rod the breakdowns of monocrystal occured due to microjets of dense plasma, traces of exposure (tracks) being recorded on both films by Fe ions ejected from the rod perpendicular to its axis.<br><br> To estimate the electric field parameters I measured the track lengths on films and lines posted in monocrystal using computer software. I estimated average ion energy from these data. Also I evaluated some other parameters of the electric field (tension, the force acting on the ion by the field, and volumetric energy density) and the ion charges. I also estimated frequency of the field oscillations from damages of monocrystal.<br><br> The obtained results can be used in studies of interactions between microparticles and solid substances, as well as for protection of electronics in space ships on the attacks of space dust bunches.

ASTROCYTE VS. NEURON: WHAT DOMINATES?
Alexander Korotkikh
Lyceum 40, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod region, RUSSIA

The purpose of my research is to explore how astrocyte dynamics can effectively regulate neuronal activity. Ten years ago, it was believed that the role of the astrocytes - a type of glial cells - is to provide metabolic support for neurons. Recently it was discovered that astrocytes can also participate in synaptic signaling in the brain. They can feel neuroactive chemicals released by the neurons and respond by transient increase of calcium concentration. There is a bidirectional cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes. My scientific advisor and I hypothesized that astrocytes modulate neuronal activity and synchronize signals in neighboring neurons.<br><br> To describe neuronal dynamics, I designed four programs which describe mathematical models which allow to perform the numerical simulation. These models are described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. The first pair of these models – Hodgkin-Huxley equations and Li-Rinzel equations – was used for verification. To model the possible outcome of the astrocyte versus neuron communication, I generated two mathematical models comprising a net of one neuron and one astrocyte and a net of three neurons and one astrocyte. To answer our question we choose the model of three neurons and one astrocyte because this model is more adequate with real net. It was found that astrocyte in such net can generate signals of similar shapes with ones found in the experiments. Moreover, the model predicts that due to the interaction the activation of the astrocyte may increase the probability of synchronous firing in neighboring neurons. <br><br> The results of this research can help to explain the role of astrocytes in the processing of information in neural nets.

DETERMINING A HABITABLE ZONE AROUND A STAR: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH USING PHYSICS, MATHEMATICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, ASTRONOMY, AND BIOLOGY
Yeonsoo Sara Lee
Myers Park High School, Charlotte, NC

The goal of this project is to determine the habitable zone around a star, given the mass of the star. This habitable zone would apply only to stars that involved a singular solar system, as it examines the gravitational pull of one star. The research focuses on deriving the mass of the object being orbited by finding the velocity, acceleration, and the period of the orbit of the satellite using Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, principles of circular motion, and Newton’s Second Law of Motion. Then, utilizing software such as Mathematica and LoggerPro, using compiled research from areas of astronomy, biology, and physics, the project finally mathematically derives the boundaries for known life. The definition of life to set the parameters of the scope of the zone depends on the ability for existing life to grow and reproduce. The research utilizes various sources of research and information to define at which conditions life<br><br>might exist, specifically the surface temperature of the satellite versus the distance from the star. This process, if combined with other aspects of chemistry and geography, could isolate the most<br><br>likely satellites for life in a singular solar system. Future work involving the study of chemical elements present in the satellite and its atmosphere should help in further narrowing down the most likely suspects.

HOW DOES THE SHAPE OF THE CROSS-SECTION OF A FOUR FOOT PINE BEAM AFFECT HOW MUCH LOAD IT CAN SUPPORT AT ITS MIDDLE POINT?
Daniel Mohsen Tehrani
Henry W. Grady High School, Atlanta, GA

The purpose of my project was to test out how the shape (cross-section) of a beam affects how much load it can support at its middle point. I wanted to learn what shape beam I should use if I needed to support a specific load. My three experiments included using different shaped beams to test my question/purpose. My first test was conducted on a square beam, with measurements of 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch by four feet. My second experiment consisted of a test on a rectangular beam, and my third experiment used a triangular beam. During each trial, I measured the deflection of the beam from its original position with no load applied to the loaded after 5 pounds were added. I recorded this information into my logbook, and later made charts and graphs that showed the deflection of the beams over the 5 pound weight increments and the final breaking point. At the end of the experiment, I found that my hypothesis was true. The square beam did hold the most weight out of the three beams I tested because it had the same height as the rectangular and triangle beam, and the square beam had the greatest moment of inertia of the three beams. However, the rectangular beam surprised me because it snapped at 45 pounds and the triangle beam snapped at 15 pounds, while the square could support a maximum weight of 55 pounds and snap at 60 pounds. In the end, I now have the knowledge of how beam shape affects strength, including all the items I learned throughout the course of this experiment.

PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF AN ECLIPSING BINARY STAR SYSTEM
Piper Michelle Reid
Dripping Springs High School, Dripping Springs, TX

A binary star system is a pair of stars that are bound together by gravity. Most of the stars that we see in the night sky are members of multiple star systems. A system of stars where one star passes in front of the other (as observed from Earth) on a periodic basis is called an eclipsing binary. Eclipsing binaries can have very short rotational periods and in all cases these pairs of stars are so far away that they can only be resolved from Earth as a single point of light. The interaction of the two stars serves to produce physical phenomena that can be observed and used to study stellar properties. By careful data collection and analysis is it possible for an amateur astronomer using commercial, low cost equipment (including a home built spectroscope) to gather photometric (brightness versus time) and spectroscopic (brightness versus wavelength) data, analyze the data, and calculate the physical properties of a binary star system?<br><br> Using a CCD camera, tracking mount and telescope photometric data of BB Pegasi was collected and a light curve produced. 57 Cygni was also studied using a spectroscope, tracking mount and telescope to prove that Doppler shift of Hydrogen Balmer absorption lines can be used to determine radial velocity. The orbital period, orbital velocity, radius of each star, separation of the two stars and mass of each star was calculated for the eclipsing binary BB Pegasi using photometric and spectroscopic data and Kepler’s 3rd Law. These data were then compared to published data.<br><br> By careful use of consumer grade astronomical equipment it is possible for an amateur astronomer to determine an array of physical parameters of a distant binary star system from a suburban setting.

WIRELESS ENERGY THROUGH TESLA COILS
Bryce Anthony Register
Manatee High School, Bradenton, FL

It was Nikola Tesla’s dream to send electricity wirelessly through the air. Well, this project did just that, and then some. It explored the most efficient design of the Tesla Coil, how radio frequency can be used to transport electricity and how Tesla Coils can be used to power electronics. <br><br>A Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produces high voltage and high frequency alternating current electricity; it’s a resonant transformer circuit, which transfers energy by making a coil vibrate causing oscillating current, this generates a magnetic field. And because the coil is highly resonant, energy can be picked up if a second coil is near it.<br><br>I hypothesized that if different gauges were tested, then the greater gauge would perform the best when sending electricity wirelessly. I measured the electricity produced from the coil from certain distances away with different gauges of wire for the oscillating coil. During the trials, I measured the output of each coil and then their ability at different distances. But then I realized that there’s a correlation between the output and its ability to transfer at longer distances. <br><br>In the end, the lower gauge proved the best because Wire Gauge is inversed to the diameter; therefore having greater surface area and less resistance while transporting electrons. With this, I will soon prove cords obsolete, power electric cars, and even send electricity to developing countries wirelessly; creating many more jobs for people around the world and creating a better, more sustainable, Earth.

OBSERVATION AND INVESTIGATION ON POLARIZATION SHIFT
Yuan Fu
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Beijing, CHINA

This project stemmed from a polarization phenomenon observed occasionally. The linear polarized light emitted from TN LCD screen was found first. According to TN LCD display principle, the above observation was explained clearly. Sequentially, the phenomenon that the polarization direction of the linear polarized light reflected by a glass mirror LCD changed by 90° was observed also. However, the polarization direction of the light refracted through the mirror kept no change. This phenomenon was supposed as a polarization shift happened after the reflection. To verify my assumption, a set of optical experiments was conducted. Also, the phenomenon was analyzed by using Fresnel formula. The experimental and theoretical results show that the polarization shift happens indeed when the polarized light is reflected by a mirror. Based on this conclusion, an assumption about the same elliptical polarization shift as the linear polarized light was formed rationally and logically. And, it was verified through another set of experiments also.<br><br>Based on the above results, a 3D stereo display was designed and developed, which consists of two LCD screens in an "open book" configuration and a half-silver-coated mirror bisecting 45° between the screens. In addition, a 3D control device was created, which can realize the interaction between the display user and the 3D scene. The low cost 3D display can improve users’ fantastic immersion feeling, and the real time interaction has been carried out. The results indicate that the polarization shift phenomenon has great value.<br><br>

FIRST PLACE FINISH: REDUCING DRAG ON BOAT HULLS
Claire Elise Glenn
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Boat travel has significantly impacted history, allowing for sea trading routes, exploration, colonization, and long distance communication. In the modern sailing world, sailboat racers try a variety of finishes to lessen boat drag. These finishes mainly fall under two categories: smooth and rough. The researcher hypothesizes that a smoother finish will have less drag than a rougher finish, allowing the boat to move through the water faster. <br><br> Prepared wooden eggs, used to simulate a boat hull, were coated in seven different finishes to be tested: wax, graphite powder, anti-fouling bottom paint, sanded anti-fouling bottom paint, 50grit sanded gel coat, 600grit sanded gel coat, and 1500grit sanded gel coat. After the eggs were prepped, each one was dropped into a tube of water, and timed on how quickly it descended. <br><br> This experiment neither supported nor rejected the researcher’s hypothesis. The smoother finishes were both faster and slower than the rougher finishes. The 600grit sanded egg supported the hypothesis by being much quicker than the rough 50grit sanded egg. However, the 1500grit sanded egg rejected the hypothesis by going slower than both 600 and 50. It was discovered that the sanding grits’ affects have a bell curve. The easier a boat hull slides through water, the less fuel is needed to burn to propel it forward, saving fuel. Furthermore, knowing exactly which finish gives the most advantage is absolutely priceless for a first place finish in yacht racing.

PREDICTING ELECTRON-BEAM KNOCK-ON DAMAGE IN HEXAGONAL BORON NITRIDE MONOLAYERS
Andrew Samuel Ylitalo
Stillwater Area High School, Stillwater, MN

Hexagonal Boron Nitride monolayers (h-BN) are model systems for study with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Since they are one atomic layer thick, atomic structures and defects can be characterized without obstruction from other molecular layers. In TEM, however, electrons can coulombically interact with nuclei in the sample and displace them. This displacement, called knock-on damage, frequently damages TEM samples, but can also be used to alter molecular structures to achieve desirable properties. Thus, it is important to know the probability of knock-on damage, a value quantified by the total displacement cross section. This study calculated the total displacement cross section of atoms that protrude off edges (protruding atoms) in h-BN.<br><br> <br><br>A function was developed with MATLAB to calculate the total displacement cross section given the electron-beam energy and displacement energy, which is the minimum energy required to displace the target atom. Three configurations of atoms in h-BN had known displacement energies. Based on bonding similarities between atoms in these three configurations and protruding atoms, the known displacement energies were extrapolated to estimate those of protruding atoms in h-BN.<br><br> <br><br>With the estimates of the displacement energies, upper and lower bounds of the total displacement cross sections of protruding atoms in h-BN were calculated. For high electron-beam energies (greater than 100 keV), these bounds fell within 10% of their mean value for Nitrogen and within 20% of their mean value for Boron. Knock-on damage was found possible only above electron-beam energies of 45 keV for Nitrogen and 25 keV for Boron.

DO MORE LAYER OF A GOLF BALL EQUATE TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE?
Seth John McKay
Franklin Public School, Franklin, NE

Golf is a game of precision and accuracy. A successful golfer combines distance and accuracy to get the ball from the tee to the hole with the fewest strokes. The golfer’s skill and experience need to be matched with the golf ball. The number and type of layers vary as much as the materials engineers use to create the golf ball. The purpose was to compare the distance and accuracy of drives off the tee with the different outer and inner layers of the golf ball. Golfers varying in experience hit drives off the tee with diverse distance and control claimed golf balls. The distance, swing speed and accuracy of each golf ball were recorded. It was confirmed that golf balls with a softer outer urethane covering and three layers did travel longer distances no matter the swing speed or experience of the golfer. ANOVA test confirmed the distance was statically significant at higher swing speed with the experienced golfer at P ≤.06. Where the ANOVA test for the lower swing speeds proved it was not statically significant P ≤ .22 and greater for both golfers. Analyzing the accuracy of the drives shows there was no difference in experience or swing speed, the accuracy was not affected by the type of golf ball. There is a difference in outer covering types and amount of layers. If distance of drives is what is to be achieved, a golf ball with three layers and a urethane soft outer covering should be used.

NEW IDEAS IN PHYSICS: THE MASS RATIO OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES FROM TORUS GEOMETRY
Viola Mocz
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

The theoretical calculation of the mass ratios of elementary particles is an important open question in modern physics. I introduce a new approach to reproduce experimental mass values based on a toroidal particle model. I hypothesize that mass is determined by the paths traced out in time by the motion of particles in a toroid. By considering energy levels for closed paths on the torus surface, the mass ratios emerge as a function only of integers and \pi. Then the particle-to-electron mass ratios of muon, pion, kaon, kaon-resonance, eta, eta-prime, omega, proton, neutron, lambda, sigma, xi, and tau appear to be (20/3)\pi^3, (17/2)\pi^3, 10\pi^4, 18\pi^4, 11\pi^4, (77/4)\pi^4, 5\pi^5, 6\pi^5, (178/3)\pi^3, (50/7)\pi^5, (61/8)\pi^5, (42/5)\pi^5, and (125/11)\pi^5, respectively. Similar expressions arise for other particles, and charge only modifies mass by a harmonic contribution. I also find that the mass ratios of muon-neutrino, electron, gluon, up-/down-/strange-quarks, muon, kaon, and proton fit a cyclic function within experimental errors. This sequence lays a foundation for a Periodic System of elementary particles by \pi. The results may be explained either by shell-like inner level organization of elementary matter or by assumption of a single fundamental entity whose path on the torus determines its quantum structure. In both cases the observed regularities may be analogous to the quantization of energy levels in atoms. These promising results warrant further investigation.

ORBIT ANALYSIS OF ASTEROID 68348
Ellen Zhou
Clear Brook High School, Friendswood, TX

Many near-earth asteroids (NEAs) populate our night sky. The elliptical paths of these asteroids are highly important to keep track of for many reasons, including to prevent possible collisions and to find a suitable asteroid to travel to. NASA currently maintains a database of the orbits of NEAs, but its data is often inaccurate. The purpose of this project is to propose a more cost-effective method of orbit determination that will yield comparable results.<br><br>Gauss' Method was used to calculate the orbit of Asteroid 68348,also known as 2001 LO7. Three observations were taken in June and July of 2011. The Right Ascensions and Declinations of the asteroid were calculated on each night using a Least Squares Plate Reduction. Self-written computer programs in Python were then used to generate the orbit of the asteroid.<br><br>A fourth observation was taken to measure the accuracy of the calculated orbit. A proposed location for the asteroid was generated via an ephemeris generation program based on calculations from Gauss’ Method. The NASA proposed coordinates, generated coordinates, and the actual coordinates were then compared. Gauss’ Method was also performed on data from three other observations obtained from document research, and using this data, the ephemeris generation program generated coordinates for the three self-taken observations.<br><br>The orbit determined by Gauss’ Method was found to be closer to the actual orbit than the orbit proposed by NASA by a substantial amount for two of the observations, and only slightly off for the other two. This suggests that NASA should revise their methods of orbit determination, and that Gauss’ Method is an accurate method able to be included in future plans.<br><br>

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CYCLOTRON
Thomas James Vennemann
John A. Johnson High School, Saint Paul, MN

The cyclotron was first constructed by Ernest Lawrence and M. Stanley Livingston in 1931. They outlined how they created the inventive machine, and it was done in such a way that even a student such as myself was able to comprehend, and possibly even replicate. Currently, there have been cyclotrons created in laboratories that resemble the 1931 model at a cost of around $10,000 or more. The goal of this project is an attempt to construct a functioning cyclotron used to demonstrate how electrons resonate in the machine. The method used in doing so was done by designing the parts and assembly of the parts necessary for this experiment. These parts would need to be obtained somehow, which proved to be the most difficult step of the experiment. Assembly of the parts was then accomplished swiftly, yet accurately. Data in this experiment has not been collected since there is no detector to accompany the machine, but the project is continuing and data will be obtained as soon as possible. There have been no conclusions drawn, but the project has helped me gain much knowledge regarding particle physics, and has proved to be a large stepping stone to future career possibilities. This abstract may not be completely accurate to the project presented because experimentation is still being completed from the time that the abstract has been written until the date presented.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE WASHBOARD ROAD PHENOMENON
Jacob Floyd Nichols
Brush High School, Brush, CO

This research project was conducted to study the washboard road phenomenon that I live with everyday in Morgan County, Colorado. I wanted to determine why rippling occurs, and how it could be curtailed. My hypothesis was that both the velocity and mass of wheels traveling on gravel roads would affect washboarding.<br><br> To study washboarding, I designed a round 40 cm diameter metal table mounted on a wooden pedestal. I placed a cardboard lip around the perimeter of the metal circle. I also placed a cardboard lip in an 18 cm diameter circle in the center of the metal circle. In this manner, an 11 cm “roadbed” was formed around the metal table. The roadbed was filled with salt, 3 cm deep. The table was placed on a phonograph that would turn it at either 33, 45, or 78 RPMs. A 3 inch John’s BSR racing tire was mounted onto a ring stand with a clamp. The tire was placed in contact with the salt in the roadbed. The phonograph was then run at the three different speeds, for 200 seconds. Data was taken on the distance between ripples and the height of the peaks and troughs. I also inserted a straw onto the roadbed to determine the effect of irregularities in the road surface.<br><br> My data showed that as the turntable speed increased, both the amplitude of the ripples and the wavelength increased. In other words, as the velocity increases, the washboarding gets larger and spaced farther apart. My data also showed that the build up of an incompressible material, (the straw placed in the roadbed) causes a vertical oscillation of the wheel that induces the formation of rippling. I also found that the mass of the wheel did affect how fast rippling occurred.<br><br> My conclusion is that the washboarding of gravel roads is inevitable even when tires only move over roads at 1.2 miles per hour. Morgan County will have to continue to spend money grading gravel roads to keep them safe for drivers. One way to save money in the long run would be to pave the more traveled roads.

EFFECT OF SURFACE COATINGS ON DBD ACTUATOR PERFORMANCE
Kelly Elizabeth Gray
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

It is known that on airfoils there is a disturbance in the airflow that can be eliminated by putting a plasma actuator in the airfoil. In the real world these actuators on an airfoil will come into contact with various construction materials used in the aeronautical industry such as Teflon silicone, acrylic paint, and epoxy. The purpose of this project is to see how these materials will affect the performance of the actuators, if at all, which is important to determine if they will work in the real world.<br><br> The actuators were constructed to the same dimensions. After construction the actuators were sprayed with the appropriate material. Actuators that were completely covered were indicated by the name of the material. Other actuators in which the powered electrode was not covered by the material were indicated by the name of the material as well as the name Susanna. The first set of actuators had an even coating of the material; the second set had a slightly thicker, uneven coating. Each actuator was tested at the voltage of 10-16 KV Pk-Pk twice and the force was recorded after thirty seconds. <br><br> The results suggested that the materials have a slight effect on the performance of the actuators. Compared to the control, from the first set, the Teflon Silicone- Susanna had an average 10.4% increase; the Teflon Silicone had an increase in force production of 6.31%. In the second set, Epoxy had the largest average of 14.28%, then Acrylic with 8.77%, then Teflon Silicone with 5.3%. All of the unmentioned actuators had a decrease in the force production from the control. A T-test was used to determine the significance of the data. The p-value must be .05 or below to be significant, and the majority of the data was significant.

THE THEORY BEHIND THE RISE BALL
Kaitlin Jenice Wilson
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Softball coaches and pitchers have asked themselves what is the lower velocity limit for a successful rise ball? This project looks at the body positioning and velocity of a pitch to induce enough lift force on a backward spinning softball to make the ball rise. This experiment used several human participants in order to find the threshold of the softballs velocity to make the ball move in an upward trajectory. In order to figure this out there was one human pitching the softball to a catcher. A third participant then recorded the velocity and the height of the pitch when caught. My hypothesis was that the softball will rise when thrown at 53mph. The experimental results were close but actually the ball rose at a slightly lower velocity. When the pitcher threw a straight pitch or “fast ball” the pitcher’s body was perpendicular to the ground at the point of release. When the pitcher was throwing a rise ball their body was leaned back at about an eighty-five degree angle. The speed of a fastball was quite higher than the rise ball but did not result in lift. After this experiment I have found out that the lower threshold that resulted in a lift of a softball is 51mph, two mph less than my original hypothesis.

A GENERALIZED HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL OF COSMIC ACCELERATED EXPANSION
Henry Wanjune Lin
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Several holographic models naturally account for the observed cosmic accelerated expansion, but do not attain the observational success of accepted phenomenological models. To achieve a competitive accuracy and to resolve problematic discrepancies between models, a generalized holographic model with a single additional degree of freedom is constructed. The two novel parameters of the model, alpha and beta, directly parameterize the holographic length scale, generalize standard cosmology, and allow a wide range of expansion dynamics including tracing behavior which solves the cosmic coincidence problem.<br><br>Analytic results and extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, and cosmic microwave background data tightly constrain alpha and beta. The best-fit parameters give a dark energy that approximates a cosmological constant at late times. At early times, the dark energy is non-negligible but in agreement with constraints from the early dark energy model. Finally, Bayesian analysis indicates that the generalized model improves over its limiting cases and is statistically equivalent to the linear equation of state parameterization frequently used to describe the accelerated expansion.

RESONANCE CIRCUIT WITH A NONLINEAR LIQUID CRYSTAL CAPACITOR
Sami Thabet Alsheikh
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

Liquid crystals exhibit unique dielectric properties in the nematic phase. The question arises: How does the changing dielectric constant of liquid crystal 4'octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) affect the resonance curve in an LCR circuit when the capacitor is filled with liquid crystal 8CB? The nonlinearity in the nematic phase is expected to shift the peak of the resonance curves as input voltage changes. The corresponding smectic and isotropic phases should produce consistent resonance curves, independent of input voltage. <br><br> The liquid crystal capacitor cell was housed in a temperature-controlled environment constructed in the lab and an LCR circuit was assembled using the 8CB capacitor. The temperature of the capacitor was set to 25.000°C, 36.000°C, 37.000°C, 38.000°C, and 42.000°C, covering the smectic, nematic, and isotropic phases. The sample was held at each temperature with a precision of .001°C before importing the resonance curve with a network analyzer. The results showed a non-linearity in the resonance curve in the nematic phase, distorting the resonance curve peak at 38.000°C and resonance curve shape at 36.000°C and 37.000°C. The corresponding curves for the smectic and isotropic phases were linear, as expected. The nematic phase's shape's distortion was not predicted, and, although resonance peak shifts were expected, the degree and nature of how they shifted was unexpected.<br><br> These anomalous phenomena could be explained by a dual frequency-voltage dependent dielectric constant. I am currently looking into this possibility to further understand the particularly unique dielectric 8CB.

DEUTERIUM FUSION USING INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT
Michael Joseph Kovalchick
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown, PA

Scientists have expended a great deal of effort studying nuclear fusion because of the seemingly endless potential for practical use. Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) fusion uses a high voltage electrical field to confine fuel plasma to induce fusion, and IEC devices have a research advantage of being scalable. This project endeavored to build an IEC fusion device that would provide the opportunity to both study fusion itself and to provide a source of neutrons for research use.<br><br>The investigator designed and built a tabletop IEC device consisting of a steel bell jar system and observation port. The chamber design avoided potential for vessel over-pressurization and facilitated easy disassembly for grid and material experimentation. The vacuum system allowed both evacuation of impurities at high vacuum and fuel gas addition at adjustable chamber pressure.<br><br>Initial testing with gases such as air and helium showed that plasma could be confined and maintained in the desired location. During testing with deuterium gas, observations of the plasma shapes and color spectra were made with expected results. Measurement of neutrons demonstrated a fusion rate of eighty thousand events per second. Both of the project goals were met. Higher fusion rates are likely pending improvements to the power supply and safety/shielding equipment.<br><br>An unexpected event of inner cathode rotation was observed during fusion operations. This was possibly induced by electromagnetic forces within the chamber plasma interacting with the electrostatic field. This is another topic of future investigation.<br><br>

SOLAR TSUNAMI
Kayla Lokelani Ishida
Waimea High School, Waimea, HI

This project focuses on identifying what class of solar flare will generate an observable extreme ultraviolet wave. I predict that in order for an observable extreme ultra violet (EUV) to be generated it will require an X-class solar flare. Solar flare data was observed from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly solar telescope which takes images of the solar atmosphere at different wavelengths. Using JHelioViewer I viewed compiled pictures taken of the sun over one minute time periods. I found that my hypothesis was not supported. My data does not conclusively show that only X-class solar flares will produce observable EUV waves. My results showed that 62.5% of the time X-class solar flares produced an observable EUV wave. M-class solar flares produced an EUV wave 10.5% of the time. C-class solar flares generated an EUV wave 4.3% of the time and there were no EUV waves produced by a B-class solar flare. I noticed that as the strength of the solar flare went up there is an increase in the probability of an EUV wave to be generated. I also found that in all the EUV waves that were generated a coronal mass ejection (CME) also occurred.

BUILDING BRIDGES WITH WATER: THE FLOATING WATERBRIDGE
Carolin Charlotte Lachner
Hans-Thoma-Gymnasium, Loerrach, Baden-Wurttemberg, GERMANY

The project investigated the building of a water thread between two beakers. Platinum electrodes were submerged in the center of two beakers filled with deionized water, one set to ground potential, the other on high voltage, up to 25 kV dc. Between the beakers close to each other a connection formed spontaneously, giving the impression of a floating water bridge. No electrolysis was observed. Once the beakers were pulled apart, the bridge remained stable for several hours up to a length of 2.5 cm.<br><br>Instrumentations to measure the current in the circuit, the mass flow, the forces between the beakers and the temperature in the beakers were developed. The project investigated the heat flow with an infrared camera and a method to get videos from an infrared camera which delivered only fixed images. The heat and mass flow were directed from plus to minus pole predominant. <br><br>By theoretical considerations concerning electrical and mechanical quantities the energy conversion could be clarified and compared with experimental results. Different fluids like castor oil, olive oil and glycol-water displayed bridges but no bridges with a similar length compared to water were formed.<br><br>These facts led to the conclusion that the effect was caused by the strong electrical dipole moment of H2O molecules. For the other fluids electrostatic polarization is important.

Purpose:<br><br>In this age of scarce and expansive resources this project concentrates the latest technique for producing artificial domains in non-metallic magnetic materials like wood, cardboard etc, embedding them with magnetic properties<br><br>Procedure:<br><br>The creation of artificial domains was visualized by filling up the empty pores on the surface of a non-metallic & non magnetic solid with magnetic materials using the sorption process. For this purpose a 6 x 4 x ½ inch chip board piece was dipped in a solution of iron oxide, raw iron and ammonia for 6 hours to conclude sorption. A regular chip board piece and experiment chipboard were wound by specific number of copper wire turns having thin gauge, behaving like a coil. Both were then connected to the same electric circuit, one by one, in order to power up array LEDs in series / parallel setup.<br><br>Result: <br><br>In order to do so with an input of 1.5 Volts the 26 LEDs of 3Volt each were switched on for approximately 24 hours using the experiment coil, however none of the LEDs gave light when the regular chip board coil was used. The experimental chipboard was emulating electromagnetic properties, thereby verifying the creation of artificial domains within it. <br><br>Applications:<br><br>The outcome of the experiment proves that it is possible to infuse magnetic properties within non metallic objects. The practical applications of the results were assorted including creation of economical electromagnets by magnetizing non-metals, the use of these non metals in electronic devices and creating permanent magnets.

CHARACTERIZING THE EFFECTS OF ASTEROID BELT PERTURBATIONS ON THE ORBITS OF THE INNER PLANETS
Nikita Michael Bogdanov
Albuquerque Academy, Albuquerque, NM

The planets of the solar system are subject to multiple gravitational perturbations from other solar system bodies including other planets, large asteroids (as discrete point masses), and small asteroids (cumulatively). The largest uncertainty in our knowledge of the orbits of the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) is due to perturbations from the complicated and uneven mass distribution within the asteroid belt (e.g., masses of asteroids range over many orders of magnitude).<br><br><br>The goal of this project is to computationally model the effects of perturbations from the 300 largest asteroids on the orbits of the inner planets; specifically, this project looks to characterize the perturbative effects as a noise problem, which is a novel approach. In order to do this, I have created a numerical integration framework that models Newtonian solar system interactions. Initial integrations show that numerical red noise is orders of magnitude below asteroid perturbations. I analyze these perturbations by comparing integrations with and without specific subsets of perturbing asteroids.<br><br><br>To analyze orbital element residuals I use power spectra. These yield the frequencies and amplitudes of the perturbation signals and are the first step to characterizing perturbations from a noise perspective. I find that the power spectra can exhibit red noise at low frequencies and reach a noise floor (white noise) at higher frequencies. This white noise precludes the knowledge of planetary motion at the sub-meter level, an important and original result. Tools to discriminate between chaotic and stochastic motion will be employed in future work.

DETECTION OF RADON PROGENY IN A RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT USING A HOMEBUILT GEIGER COUNTER
Lois Therese Gagnon
Gagnon Family Homeschool, Goodrich, MI

The purpose of this project was to determine whether a functional Geiger counter could be constructed at home and used to detect radiation emitted by various common items. Attempts were also made to detect the emissions of the radioactive decay chain products of radon (radon progeny). A Geiger counter was built at home, confirmed to be functional, and calibrated using a source with a known level of radioactivity. Common objects were tested for radioactive emissions by placing them at a consistent distance from the Geiger counter. Several objects did produce readings higher than background levels. Since isotopes produced by the decay of radon tend to cling to dust, the Geiger counter was placed near a dust collecting device in a two-compartment sealed enclosure. Radon gas produced by the radium-bearing paint on a clock dial was allowed to circulate between the two compartments. This was done to test whether the Geiger counter could detect the dust-borne progeny produced by radon. Fluctuations in the Geiger counter readings, corresponding to the on/off state of the dust collector, indicated that the apparatus could detect these progeny, and therefore the presence of radon. The counter/collector setup was then positioned near the groundwater sump of a residential basement, and the area was shrouded with plastic to limit air movement. Results similar to those recorded in the clock experiment were obtained, indicating that detectable levels of radon progeny were present in the sump area. This supported the hypothesis.

SODIUM ABUNDANCE OF SUNGRAZING COMETS FROM MULTI-SPACECRAFT PHOTOMETRIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
David Zhang
Richard Montgomery High School, Rockville, MD

Comets provide critical information on the cosmic abundances of the solar nebula, where the Sun, Earth and other planets originated. However, metallic abundance in a comet is difficult to obtain due to the high sublimation temperatures of metals. Sungrazing comets, a distinctive group that reaches perihelion within 10 solar radii, experience these high temperatures, but are too close to the Sun to be studied by ground-based spectroscopes. The goal of this project is to determine the relative abundance of sodium in the tails of sungrazing comets by using a unique method of analysis from the measurements of multiple spacecraft. This study is the first to investigate sungrazing comets from three different perspective angles in space simultaneously: from the SECCHI/COR2 coronagraphs of the twin STEREO (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory) spacecraft, and the LASCO/C2 and C3 coronagraphs of the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) spacecraft. The presence of a large amount of sodium causes comet tails to appear brighter and longer in the measurement from SOHO because it has a wider wavelength passband filter than STEREO. Through advanced image morphological analysis methods and photometric measurements, it is found that approximately 4% of sungrazing comet tails, by mass, is sodium. This value is 4 times the previously determined sodium abundance in the atmosphere of any solar system object. The result demonstrates the gas dynamics in the comet as it approaches the Sun. This study also highlights the effects of 3D projection, instrumental sensitivity, and various scattering mechanisms, including Rayleigh, resonance, and Thomson scattering.

PT-SYMMETRIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS
Anirudh Dasarathy
Hawken School, Gates Mills, OH

We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics that may theoretically describe new physical phenomena. Hermitian quantum mechanics may be relaxed by applying parity-time (PT) symmetry which to date has been applied strictly to the Hamiltonian operator. We investigate relaxing hermitian quantum mechanics by deriving a set of PT symmetric boundary conditions and applying these to a particle in a box to find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates. We find that although when applying our PT symmetric boundary conditions, the energy levels are not modified, the eigenstates contain an additional imaginary term. The new eigenstates result in an indefinite PT norm that is inconsistent with the probabalistic nature of quantum mechanics, so we construct a C operator and a CPT inner product that is positive definite. We further construct and show that the operator that maps our eigenstates to hermitian eigenstates is non-local and thus that our work describes new physical phenomena. Significance of this work is its potential application to optical and laser physics and extensions to relativistic quantum mechanics.

LICHTENBERG LIGHTNING
Connor Allen Alsheimer
Great Mills High School, Great Mills, MD

This experiment was conducted to better understand how magnetism affects electricity. My interest stemmed from the thought of controlling lightning. A Van de Graaff generator was used to simulate lightning and create Lichtenberg figures. The fractal properties of the figures were determined to assess the hypothesis that magnetic fields would affect electron paths on dielectric surfaces. <br><br> Lichtenberg figures were made on acrylic plates with an electrostatic shock from a Van de Graaff generator. After shocking the plate, printer toner powder was dusted over the plate to make the figure visible. Controls were made without the magnet present. Test figures were made with a permanent magnet and an electromagnet in different locations around the discharge to see the effects of the magnetic fields on the shape and fractal dimensions.<br><br> The figures were split into quadrants, and the fractal dimensions were found using a Matlab function I developed. The function evaluated the area covered by a figure at consecutively smaller grid sizes. The data were assembled into log-log graphs that were used to find fractal dimensions. Data were inspected for trends corresponding to magnet positions.<br><br> There were no significant trends that validated the hypothesis. Data outliers supported the hypothesis, but lacked consistency. It’s possible to conclude that the strength of the magnet and its proximity to the figure are not great enough to affect the figure.<br><br> If lightning could be manipulated using magnetic fields, there are applications in energy and safety. It could have an enormous economic impact saving property and lives. <br><br>

THE ROLE OF REYNOLDS NUMBER IN LIQUID-LIQUID DROP EXPERIMENTS
Alison Nicole Logia
Sequoia High School, Redwood City, CA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the most favorable conditions for forming very thin liquid columns, with drops of polyethylene oxide, in order to make very thin fibers. <br><br>Drops of water diluted liquid polyethylene oxide were ejected from a pressure regulated syringe into a bath of water. As the drop fell, it disrupted a laser trigger which began a video recording at 1000 frames per second. A computer code was used to analyze the images. The computer code determined the drop diameter, as well as the impact velocity. The viscosity was determined using an existential rheometer. Density was determined with a scale and pipette. Varying drop regimes were observed subjectively. 32 trials were collected.<br><br>Three ranges of drop regimes were explored: a ballistic range with no bubbles, a breakthrough range with bubbles, and a catch range with no bubbles. Drops were found to transition between five unique regimes. From highest Reynolds Number to lowest Reynolds Number regimes transitioned as follows: Inverted Torroid, Flat Bottom Pendant Drop, Break Through with Bubble, Torroid, Catch. A phase diagram of Froude Number vs. Reynolds Number was created to show the transition between the three ranges of drop regimes.<br><br>The most stable liquid columns were formed in the catch range; thus, drops with Reynolds number in the catch range would be most favorable to create pendant drops. The break through range formed liquid columns using bubbles which was unique from the other regimes. This could be another useful method of creating liquid columns.

SELF-PROPELLED ENERGY RESOURCE FROM GEOMETRICAL SYMMETRY BREAKING
Fang-Yu Chang
Taichung Municipal Daya Junior High School, Taichung City 428, CHINESE TAIPEI

A thin vapor layer, with a critical thickness, can be used to insulate a droplet of liquid from a hot surface underneath, which significantly reduces the evaporation rate of the droplet and provides an opportunity to study the flow of the liquid inside the droplet. In the case of water droplet, the critical thickness can be as thin as 1 mm to isolate the droplet from a 400 degrees Celcius hot plate. A self-propelled engine, which consumes the atomic binding energy of the molecules, can be manufactured by breaking the geometrical symmetry of the droplet. This self-propelled engine is demonstrated by setting the droplet to climb against gravity on an inclined plate with an asymmetrical saw-tooth surface. An edge can also trigger the self-propel machinery to generate damped oscillations of a liquid droplet traveling on the inclined hot plate. The driving force behind self-propel is identified to be from the imbalance of the circulating liquid inside the droplet that create vortices. Creating an uneven distribution of dynamical liquid vortices in the droplet is the key to trigger self-propel.

ANALYSIS OF PHOTON-MEDIATED ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN DISTINGUISHABLE MATTER QUBITS
Ari Misha Dyckovsky
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Long-distance entanglement may be utilized as a resource for teleportation of quantum states, efficient factorization of large numbers, and quantum simulations of many-body systems. I theoretically evaluated establishing remote entanglement between distinguishable matter qubits through interference and detection of two emitted photons. The fidelity of the entanglement operation was analyzed as a function of the temporal and frequency mode-matching between the photons emitted from each quantum memory. With a general analysis, I defined limits on the absolute magnitudes of temporal and frequency mode-mismatches in order to maintain fidelities greater than 99% with two-photon detection efficiencies greater than 90%. I applied the analysis to several selected systems of quantum memories. Results indicated that high fidelities may be achieved in each system using current experimental techniques, while maintaining acceptable rates of entanglement. Thus, it might be possible to use two-photon-mediated entanglement operations between distinguishable quantum memories to establish a network for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation.

INFERRING SHAPE AND/OR ATTITUDE FROM NON-RESOLVED PHOTOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF GEOSYNCHRONOUS SATELLITES
Travis Crockett
V. Sue Cleveland High School, Rio Rancho, NM

Geosynchronous satellites are critical to our modern way of life, but operational issues and anomalies do arise that might be addressed by observations of the exterior state of these extremely valuable assets. However, long ranges and physical limitations prohibit even these large satellites from being directly imaged by any ground-based telescope. My objective was to develop a methodology to invert limited satellite shape and/or attitude attributes from time-resolved photometric light curves, using a small 30 centimeter telescope, color filters, and a scientific-grade Charge-Coupled Device (CCD). I developed a robust simulation technique that exploits non-resolved measured photometry to provide insight into a satellite’s state. Photometric light curves were taken on twenty commercial geosynchronous satellites; data were taken during both the solstice and vernal equinox seasons. Hundreds of images, taken throughout each night, were processed to obtain the point-source signals for each satellite. Each satellite had a remarkably unique signature that was repeatable on a daily basis. During the equinox, strong glint features were found to correlate well with specular solar panel orientations. Material Bidirectional Reflectivity Distribution Functions (BRDF) were inverted using a low-order two dimensional radiometric model to fit the measured light curves. A more complex three dimensional satellite model was ray-traced to provide the final confirmation of the radiometric signatures. With good agreement between the model and measured data, I was able to accurately discern the solar panel offset angles. The repeatable signatures were clearly a consequence of the high quality trajectory and attitude station-keeping for all these satellites.

THE EFFECT OF CHANNEL GEOMETRY ON MICROFLUDIC VORTEX FLOW INSIDE OF DROPLETS
Vipul Anjan Nandigala
Walled Lake Western High School, Walled Lake, MI

The purpose of my experiment was to observe the flow patterns inside of droplets at a micrometer level. These droplets were traveling through a channel of dimension 150 micrometers*100 micrometers. The independent variable of this experiment was not the size of the channel but the actual shape of the channel. By changing the shape of the channel that the water droplets were flowing through, the droplets would behave differently. So by changing the channel geometry, unique flow patterns inside the droplet called vortex flow would be changed. The vorticity or strength or these vortices were measured and compared to the vorticity in other channel geometries. <br><br> The experiment was created by forming a t-junction between two different channels. In one these channels water was flowing through at a constant velocity, however 0.5 micron particles were mixed with the water to be used as a tracer so I could observe the flow patterns by tracing the particle movement. The other channel was filled with an oil called oleic acid. As these two fluids met at the t-junction, would first interrupt the water's path, but almost instantaneously the water would push back. The process would continue and each repetition would form a droplet. Finally these droplets of water, surrounded by oil, would flow through a long channel where they were observed under a microscope.

NANO-TESLA MAGNETIC FIELD SENSORS FOR AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR EARTHQUAKES
Ananya Mukundan
International Academy East, Troy, MI

Earthquakes are some of the most prevalent natural disasters and some of the most deadly as well. The recent earthquake and the accompanying tsunami in Japan not only caused deaths and global economic slowdown, but it also resulted in partial-melt down of 4 nuclear reactors. Current technologies for the prediction of earthquakes are simply nonexistent. <br><br>This project addresses an enabling technology based on magnetic field sensors for the prediction of earthquakes. It is well known that low-frequency (0.1-10 Hz), low-intensity magnetic fluctuations, 10-100 nano-Tesla (nT) in magnitude, occur hours or days before a quake. The fluctuations are a million times smaller than the Earth’s magnetic field and may require expensive low-temperature superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors. This report is on the successful development of ultrasensitive, low-cost, room-temperature magnetic field sensors that would enable the deployment of such sensors and sensor networks for earthquake prediction. <br><br>The sensors are based on magnetoelectric composites that convert the hard-to-measure magnetic field to easy-to-measure electrical voltage. The composites studied have two components: a ferromagnetic layer that responds to the magnetic field by producing a mechanical strain and a piezoelectric layer that converts the mechanical strain to a voltage. <br><br>The data indicates that the samples are able to detect fields as small as 0.1 nT at 1-10 Hz, a sensitivity that is ideal for measuring 10-100 nT field fluctuations that precede an earthquake. <br><br>Suggested follow-up efforts include large scale deployment of the sensors and sensor networks in earthquake prone regions for field tests and ultimately the development of a sensor-based early warning system.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW VOLTAGE, SOLID-STATE PLASMA FOCUS DEVICES FOR PORTABLE RADIATION SOURCES
Adam Joseph Bowman
Montgomery Bell Academy, Nashville, TN

The dense plasma focus (DPF) could potentially act as a portable radiation source for a variety of applications, including neutron interrogation, explosives detection, and X-ray lithography. The sub-kilojoule, high voltage DPF devices developed thus far, however, remain bulky and complex in comparison to commercially available radiation sources. The presented research explored the feasibility of using low voltage capacitors to develop portable DPF radiation sources capable of solid-state operation. A 50J DPF was constructed using a 4µF, 5kV oil capacitor. Magnetic pinch signatures in the dI/dt signal from this device verified pinch formation, and successful operation was observed with charging voltages between 3.4 and 5kV. Hard X-ray and soft X-ray analyses were performed to characterize pinch radiation output, and ions emitted by the pinch were detected through an indirect time-of-flight technique. Based on these results, a low voltage plasma focus could easily be operated with solid-state switching, and a thyristor switch is currently being implemented in the low voltage device. The developed DPF is the first device to use a conventional low voltage capacitor and achieve successful operation, allowing for practical low voltage, solid-state DPF radiation sources to be developed for portable applications.

THE NOVEL DETERMINATION OF THE STOPPING POWER AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF QUARK GLUON PLASMA BASED ON SEVERAL JET MODIFICATION MEASUREMENTS
Shannon Phelan Wetzler
Kings Park High School, Kings Park, NY

At a relativistic heavy ion collider at a national laboratory collides gold nuclei at up to sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV of energy. Then, quarks and gluons enter a new de-confined state known as Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) which existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang. Thus, QGP provides insight into the properties of the early universe. One important property is the stopping power of QGP, or its ability to quench hard-scattered partons (jets). The suppression factor can be determined by the magnitude of suppression of particles. In this study, this was measured with the PHENIX detector, and determined to be about 5 for neutral pions. Using the nuclear modification factor (RAA) and Dokshitzer and Kharzeev's formulae, the stopping power of QGP was calculated to be ~0.75 GeV^2/fm. The specific shear viscosity (n/s) was calculated as 0.1, approximately the conjectured theoretical limit of 0.07. The Debye mass and screening length of QGP were also calculated. A novel formula for Rcp (the ratio of central to peripheral collisions) was developed from path-length and transverse momentum. This could replace RAA for accelerators at new energies. The theoretical model of Dokshitzer and Kharzeev was validated based off of the stopping power, suggesting that QGP loses energy primarily through gluonic radiation. Because there is minimal n/s while QGP loses energy through radiation, it can be concluded that QGP is neither extremely strongly or weakly coupled, requiring both perturbative and lattice calculations to fully understand the nature of QGP and the universe.

STELLAR EVOLUTION OF A PULSATING SUBDWARF B STAR CS 1246: IS THE HELIUM CORE BURNING OUT?
Arjun Raghavan
Chapel Hill High School, Chapel Hill, NC

The photometric pulsation amplitudes of the pulsating sub-dwarf B (sdBV) star CS 1246 were taken in order to determine whether the helium core at the center of the star is burning out, causing a dampening of the pulsations due to a build-up of heavier, more opaque elements that are ‘replacing’ the helium.The study is significant because it shows the evolution of a star in ‘real-time’. <br><br> The data that reflects the pattern of sdB star evolution has the potential to help astronomers and astrophysicists in their studies of these subdwarf B stars by showcasing the extent, timescale, and effects of the evolutionary mechanisms of such stars. The filtered measurements taken in this study were unique for this rare pulsating sub-dwarf. <br><br> The data was collected by taking observations with UNC’s PROMPT Telescopes in Chile and analyzed using software suites, Afterglow, Microsoft Excel and Period 04. Light curves with axes of amplitude vs. time and Fourier transforms with axes of amplitude vs. frequency were plotted. Least Squares Fit was computed and compared with the observed light curves. <br><br> The pulsation amplitude measurements of CS 1246 were found to have significantly reduced compared to measurements taken 2-4 years ago suggesting that the star is getting more opaque on all ends of the electromagnetic spectrum. This evidence points to a helium burn-out in the core of the star.

CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES VIA DRY ICE EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE
Kevin Murray Frink
Isaac Bear Early College High School, Wilmington, NC

This science project is designed to answer a question of whether or not a chemical reaction is needed to produce industrial quantities of carbon nanostructures by exposing dry ice to a high temperature that is at least 3100°C. A small carbon arc furnace powered by an electric welder is used to produce the high temperature. During control runs, the carbon arc furnace is energized for a predetermined time, after which the carbon arc furnace is de-energized and any carbon particles within the furnace are collected. During carbon nanostructures synthesis runs, dry ice is placed within the carbon arc furnace. The carbon arc furnace is energized and the dry ice is consumed for the predetermined time. Carbon nanostructures synthesized during the synthesis runs are collected once the carbon arc furnace is de-energized and allowed to cool. The volume of the carbon particles collected during the control runs is compared to the volume of the carbon nanostructures produced by the synthesis runs. This science project has discovered that on average at least 16 times more carbon nanostructures are produced during synthesis runs consuming dry ice as opposed to the control runs. Moreover, the synthesis runs did not rely on chemical reactions. Further still, samples of the synthesized carbon nanostructures were imaged using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM images clearly show high-quality carbon nanostructures that include carbon nanotubes, faceted carbon nanospheres, and the super-material graphene.

At present, the method of calculating many of the fundamental (physical) constants which describe our universe is unknown. This includes fermion masses, which are currently set by arbitrary coupling constants in the Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model. A new mass relationship between the muon and tau leptons is presented and is found to calculate the mathematical constant within an uncertainty of 0.0036%. A geometric analogue of the mass relationship is then used as a model to propose a possible mechanism of how the mass of the muon was chosen during the birth of our universe.

N-BODY COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS OF PLANETESIMAL AGGLOMERATION IN EARLY SYSTEM GAS GIANT FORMATION
Ian A Sohl
DaVinci Academy of Science and the Arts, Ogden, UT

This simulation tests the possibility of dust particle agglomeration through gravitational attraction in early system gas giants. While the proto-planetary gas nebula lingers around a forming solar system, ice accumulates from the sea of gas and dust. As the small ice bodies shatter in collisions, larger dust particles are entrained in the gas. Theories predict that the gas protects these dust particles from being dispersed by the solar wind from the star. This N-body symplectic simulator calculates the growth and orbital dynamics about the sun of a proto-gas giant planetesimal within a solar nebula comprised of super-particles moving through the early interplanetary gas. Super-particles are the standard method used for modeling large numbers of similar objects, in this case the dust particles. As a proto-gas giant moves through the gas cloud, these simulations will determine its rate of accumulation of dust particles. If the planetary core can grow to roughly 5-10 Earth masses within 1 million years, it can begin to accumulate enough of the remaining gas to form into a Jupiter-like state similar to what is observed in planetary systems today. Simulation results indicate that planetary formation can happen on a significantly smaller timescale than expected. In test systems with 10,000 test particles composing 1/100th of the mass of the Sun, the protoplanet grows from 1 to 7 Earth masses in roughly 300 years, considerably faster than traditional theories. These results help us better understand the formation of our solar system, extra-solar systems and planetary nebulae observed around protostars.

EXOPLANETS AND SUN-LIKE STARS AMONG BINARY STAR SYSTEMS
Craig Maughan
Burnt Hills - Ballston Lake High School, Burnt Hills, NY

Recently, astronomical work in the discovery and characterization of exoplanets has <br><br>grown dramatically. Astronomers have traditionally looked toward Sun-like stars in their search for exoplanets because those stars have temperatures, luminosities, and other characteristics that are favorable to life. Often, Sun-like stars occur in binary star systems. Astronomers estimate that over half of all stars reside in binary or multiple-star systems. Because there are so many planets that could reside in these systems, it is important to understand whether Sun-like stars in binary systems differ from those in singular systems and whether these differences could affect the existence of exoplanets and their habitability. The purpose of this research was to identify Sun-like binary stars, determine their fundamental properties for more complete characterization, and calculate the range of planetary orbits in which a planet could support liquid water and possibly life. I analyzed data that were gathered using the 1.1-meter John Hall telescope and spectrometer at Lowell Observatory. Spectra were calculated for the Sun-like binary systems WW Dra and Z Her. Further experimentation and computation resulted in precise measurements for spectral shift, component velocity, systemic velocity, orbital period, and habitable zone of these systems. This research characterizes Sun-like binary stars more fully and adds to astronomers’ understanding of these common star systems so that they may be included in the search for habitable exoplanets or extraterrestrial life.

SHINING LIKE THE SUN: A NOVEL QUANTUM MECHANICAL APPROACH TO PROPERTY ANALYSIS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ALGORITHM FOR WHITE-LIGHT LEDS
Valerie S. Ding
The Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR

LEDs are not widely adopted for lighting despite their energy efficiency because of their uncomfortable monochromatic light. White-light LEDs are a solution to this problem, but they must be further researched and developed. Current research methods mainly involve costly and time-consuming experimentation; a faster, low-cost, and accurate method is needed. This investigation discovers and demonstrates feasibility of a quick and economic methodology for identifying and characterizing white-light LED materials and estimating energy efficiency.<br><br>The solutions to Schrödinger's equation were calculated using ab initio quantum mechanical approximation methods to establish electronic structures and identify bandgaps by using lattice constants, primitive translations, element positions, and atomic numbers. Software facilitated calculation and visualized properties of these materials. Electronic band structures, crystal structures, charge densities, and imaginary dielectric functions were generated and analyzed.<br><br>Calculated bandgaps and imaginary dielectric functions were qualitatively accurate in that they indicated correct emitted light color for the materials. After developing an algorithm to estimate LED and system efficiency for phosphor conversion materials, it was determined that gallium phosphide, zinc selenide, and gallium nitride could be used in red, green, and blue LEDs for the RGB method for white-light LEDs, while zinc selenide, boron nitride, and aluminum nitride could be used as blue or ultraviolet LEDs for the phosphor conversion method for white-light LEDs.<br><br>This discovers and demonstrates a new way for potential white-light LED materials to be analyzed for feasibility and efficiency without costly and time-consuming experimentation.

EFFECT OF WATER TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON CAVITATION
James Vincent Roggeveen
Nantucket High School, Nantucket, MA

Cavitation is a phenomena resulting from reduced pressure in a fluid allowing suspended gases to form cavities, which later collapse and make a sharp sound. This experiment tested whether the acoustical signature created by cavitation would be affected by a change in water temperature. <br><br> Cavitation was produced by a 4.75 cm propeller rotating at 2500 RPM in a tank. A hydrophone recorded the sound. Examples of cavitation were isolated and analyzed using a sound analysis program. Using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, frequencies of each sample were plotted against amplitude, visually identifying how much of each frequency was present. <br><br> Sound samples of cavitation, based on visual observation, were plotted against a control sound sample from when no cavitation was being produced. Sound samples of cavitation from different temperatures also contrasted against each other. Observation indicated less cavitation at lower temperatures. Frequency peaks shifted between warm water cavitation and cold water cavitation. <br><br> The data supports the hypothesis that a change in water temperature would affect the acoustical signature of cavitation. The results are supported by the dimensionless cavitation number, which predicts more cavitation in a warmer fluid.

EFFECT OF THE REFLECTANCE AND EMITTANCE OF HEAT IN THE ENERGY SAVING AND PRESERVATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Nataly Camacho-Rodriguez
Asuncion Rodriguez de Sala, Guayanilla, PUERTO RICO

Having in mind the stifling heat and the high cost and energy consumption in Puerto Rico, emerges the idea to investigate if a paint with silicon micro particles that reflect a high index of emittance and reflectance will allow lowering the temperature in the indoors contributing with the saving of energy and environment preservation. The investigator developed a new technology in thermal barrier coating using insulating micro particles with these characteristics that will create comfortable indoor temperatures. The reflective material used was silicon micro particles added to a conventional paint. Different tests were performed for this new paint. A conventional paint and roof sealant were chosen as a comparative sample. Four models of wooden houses were built. Both the control and the experimental houses were painted by stages, first the outside of the houses; then the inside and the roof. Temperature measurements were recorded daily during each stage. To simulate the sun radiation, bulbs were placed outside the houses. Thermometers were placed inside and outside of each house. Observations and data were recorded daily for a week. The results showed that the average temperature outside the house with reflective paint was 112 Farenheit degrees and 79 Farenheit degrees inside the house. The house painted with the conventional paint had 101 Farenheit degrees outdoors and 92 Farenheit degrees indoors. Using the reflective paint will be a lasting investment for 5 years and the cost will be around $100.00. It is concluded that the special paint prepared with silicon micro particles reduces temperature inside the house.

COSMIC RAY MUONS: SPEED AND LIFETIME
Joel Eduardo Fuentes-Santiago
CROEM, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Muons (µ-) and antimuons (µ+) are subatomic particles created through weak interactions between highly energetic cosmic rays and the nuclei of atmospheric particles. This research aims to compare the travel time of muons with its mean lifetime. The hypothesis was that Special Relativity mathematics would provide a solution to the problem. Both values were determined experimentally to find the maximum expected flux of muons according to two theories of kinematics: Classical Theory of Physics and Special Relativity. The problem was: Why do some muons get detected when they were supposed to have decayed in the time span of 50.3µ and what is their time-dilated half-life? The derived result is that cosmic ray muons propagating towards earth close to the speed of light experience an elapsed time that is less than the elapsed time on earth by the Lorentz factor .<br><br> (\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt[2]{1-\frac{V^2}{C^2}}}) <br><br> Knowledge about the muons’ travel time (earth frame) and mean lifetime was then acquired. In conclusion, a comparison using Compact Muon Solenoid and e-Labs, provided results that supported the hypothesis. At a speed of 29.8 cm/ns, the muon can then traverse that distance in 5.5 (µs). The time-dilated half-life in this case would be 14.3 (µs). This is 3.53 half-lives, leaving approximately 86,605 muons out of a million. Therefore, cosmic ray muons travelling close to the speed of light are detected even after a couple of average half-lives because of the time dilation (5.5 µs) and length contraction (1641 m) in time parameters.

WHICH HAS THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF DATA TRACK SPACING: CDS OR DVDS?
Sarah Eva DiSalvo
Coral Academy of Science of Las Vegas, Henderson, NV

What is greater; the data track spacing on CD’s or the data track spacing on DVD’s? The purpose of my experiment is to find out if CD data track spacing will be greater than DVD data track spacing.<br><br> In my experiment I used a piece of graph paper that was attached to a piece of cardboard and I leaned it at a 90 degree angle. Next I the put the CD flat on the table, label side down, in front of the graph paper and pointed the laser straight down at a 90 degree angle towards the CD. I recorded two angles that reflected off of the disks. I did this with 2 DVD’s; One DVD with 105 minutes and one DVD with 181 minutes. I also did this for 2 CD’s; one with 42.4 minutes of song play and one with 1.1 hours of song play.<br><br> My hypothesis stated that the CD’s would have greater space between the reflected lasers, or greater data track spacing because the DVD’s held more GB. It is proven that DVD’s hold 7x more information than CD’s, but yet they are the same size. So I thought that CD’s would have more room for space.<br><br> My hypothesis was sadly wrong though. The DVD’s had shown a much greater spacing than the CD’s. DVD#1 had 30 degrees spacing, and DVD#2 had 90 degree spacing while CD#1 had 10 degree spacing and CD#2 had 5 degree spacing! Therefore my hypothesis was incorrect.

AN OPTICAL COUPLER TO PREVENT SIPM DESENSITIZATION
Connor Lawrence Burke
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are being considered as replacement devices for certain optical sensing components of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Center for High Energy Physics (CERN). Currently, multichannel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) are being used to record these signals for the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment (CMS) for the LHC. SiPMs, however, are multipixel semiconductor photodiodes that when operated above a breakdown voltage will create a high intrinsic gain. These SiPMs suffer from desensitization, which occurs in the event of two photons hitting a single pixel within a time period on the order of 10 ns. In an attempt to prevent desensitization and increase SiPM efficiency, optical couplers have been created to blend light, causing incoming photons to be spread across the SiPM, while optimizing their transmission. This blending will help to increase the efficiency of the SiPM. From testing transmission rates and analyzing the profiles for blending, it was determined that a 3.25 mm Fiber Optic Products fiber with a Teflon cladding in an aluminum sleeve may serve as a novel mixer for improving SiPM efficiency. This knowledge of an efficient coupler can improve data collection for highenergy collisions at the CMS experiment.

NEURONAL NONLINEAR DYNAMICS: FROM AN OPTICAL ILLUSION TO PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Sara Kornfeld Simpson
Patrick Henry High School, San Diego, CA

This project applied a novel physical framework of perception, based on modeling neurons as nonlinear oscillators, to understand the underlying biophysical basis for the Continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion (C-WWI), the perceived switch in direction of repetitive motion under continuous illumination. I used the nonlinear dynamics of direction-selective neurons to create equations for a neural-network model. Neurons were modeled as mutually-coupled, nonlinear phase oscillators, subject to excitatory stimuli and cortical (dopaminergic) inhibition, in a way that emphasized common neural characteristics across different parts of the brain. Numerical tests were conducted to determine if this model accurately reproduced published data on perception of the illusion and neural activity in observers during perception.<br><br>The time-dependent phases of neurons in direction-selective clusters were numerically determined as a function of variables such as excitation strength of the stimulus, strength of the inhibition, and excitation and inhibition from other neurons. The resulting phases were then analyzed and graphed to determine the type and degree of synchronization between neurons. Partial and full synchronization only between same-direction neuron clusters, or across neuron clusters, was observed for different parameter values. Significantly, switching between different clusters, representing perceptual switches, occurred with a probability consistent with published studies of the C-WWI.<br><br>The model accurately described oscillatory temporal patterns of direction-selective neurons. Neural synchronization without external stimulation, associated with Parkinsonian tremors, resulted from further variation in parameters, indicating broad applications in understanding brain function.

DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW COST INFRARED SPECTROPHOTOMETER AND A MATLAB PROGRAM TO DETECT TERRESTRIAL AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL WATER VAPOR
Lakshmi R. Raju
Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

Detection of water in the atmosphere and extraterrestrial bodies is a priority in planetary science. Development of a low cost infrared spectrophotometer to detect water vapor may also assist in teaching and learning spectrophotometry. <br><br>Purpose: To develop a low cost infrared spectrophotometer to measure water vapor content and to create a Matlab program to analyze absorption data.<br><br>Procedure: An infrared spectrophotometer was created employing two narrow bandwidth infrared filters of 940nm and 1000nm +/-9nm wavelengths; 1000nm as the control. The light source was an incandescent lamp placed on one end of a 10 foot collimating tube serving as the light path. Humidity (measured using a hygrometer) in the tube was controlled using water or dehumidifying packs. Low and high humidity environments were created. Light exited from the collimator passed through a convex lens onto a silicon photodiode through one of the two filters. A multimeter with digital output was connected to the photodiode and was streamed to a laptop. <br><br>Data Analysis: A Matlab program was created to analyze the voltage output from the multimeter. Mean, standard error of mean and the p value were calculated to test group variance and establish significance.<br><br>Data: Absorption as reflected by voltage output from the 940nm filter when compared to the 1000nm filter was significantly higher (p=0.002) at the higher humidity range(avg. 80%) than in the lower humidity range (avg. 35%). The Matlab program successfully output graphical illustration of absorption.<br><br>Conclusion: A low cost infrared spectrophotometer was successfully created to detect water vapor.

THE EFFECTS OF ROTATIONAL AND IMPACT FORCES ON THE KNEE LIGAMENTS
Elizabeth Bernadette Posney
Freeport Area Senior High School, Sarver, PA

Knee ligament damage is a common occurrence among athletes, and there is a need for an anatomically correct model to use as a predictor of knee injuries due to applied forces. The purpose of this experiment was to determine what types of impact and knee movements cause the most stress to the four major knee ligaments (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL], posterior cruciate ligament [PCL], medial collateral ligament [MCL], and lateral collateral ligament [LCL]). A mechanical lower extremity model was constructed that anatomically simulated the knee ligaments utilizing leather and springs. Three different forces /rotations were applied to the model simulating common mechanisms of knee injuries. The femur was rotated counter-clockwise, and impacts to the collateral sides of the knee joint were simulated as well as impacts to the back of the lower leg. Analysis of the physical data supported the experimental hypothesis. The highest stress was recorded in the MCL when the femur was rotated, in the MCL and LCL with the lateral impact testing, and in the ACL with posterior impact. Vector analysis supported these results with only a 17% variance between experimental and predicted mathematical values. The mechanical model used during experimentation can be used as a teaching aid to those in the medical field and could be used as a tool in developing protective equipment, new physical therapy exercises, and athletic movements to prevent injuries to the knee ligaments.

COMPARING FFTS OF DIFFERENT GENRES TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS IN MUSIC
Noah Davisson Kihatan
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw

The purpose of this project was to find if there was a relationship between the genre a song was placed in and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that is done on it. The hypothesis for this project was that there would be no correlation between the FFT done on a song and the genre it was placed in.<br><br> To do this project five songs were chosen from each of 14 different genres of music. These songs were analyze by taking a thirty-second clip of the song containing the chorus and using the analyze function of Audacity. The data points were then exported, and angle measures were found that correlated how alike two songs were. This was done by making vectors of two songs using the x-axis as the frequency, the y-axis as the decibel reading, and using the dot product equation to find the angle between them. The angle between each frequency of each combination of songs was averaged. These averages were then compared. <br><br> When comparing the numbers gathered from the dot products there was a higher correlation between different parts of one song than different songs. There were, however, more similar songs in the genre metal compared to the genre rock, which shows that as genres become more specific, there might be more of a correlation between the songs. This could be useful for online retailer like the iTunes Store.

A NOVEL PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MEDICALLY RELEVANT RADIOISOTOPES
Taylor Ramon Wilson
Davidson Academy of Nevada, Reno, NV

A novel technique was developed for producing Medical Radioisotopes. The device produces produces Short-Lived Positron Emitters (SLPEs), used in PET imaging, using the technology of the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF). By utilizing the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects of the Plasma Pinch in such a device under an appropriate accelerating gas (Deuterium, Helium-3, Hydrogen), Accelerating Gradients of 5+ MeV have been obtained in a table-top device. These energetic Ion Beams represent energies previously available only in multi-million-dollar Cyclotron or Linear Accelerator facilities requiring large amounts of space and shielding. Along with the production of SLPEs, the ability to produce Molybdenum-99 through Photo-nuclear Reactions in Clinical Electron LINACs has been demonstrated, along with a discussion of possible production scenarios.

Timothy Michael Aulds
Ridgway Christian School, Pine Bluff, AR

The purpose of this experiment was to test the same 4 golf balls and 2 drivers on the Jaycees Golf Course one of the testing site from last year. The new variable this year was to use two additional people to test the balls and drivers.<br><br>My hypothesis was Participant 3 would drive the Noodle golf ball the farthest using the Taylor Made r5 driver. I used the same 4 golf balls, with the same 2 drivers that I have used in my previous 3 years of experiments but added 2 additional participants. I tested which ball would travel the farthest hit by other participants. <br><br>We hit each ball 4 times with each driver. As we hit each ball, the distance the ball traveled was measured by my mother using a measuring gauge. I charted the distances each time we hit each golf ball. I averaged the distance for each ball hit with each driver to determine which ball traveled the farthest distance the most times at each driving range. I calculated the average rolling time.<br><br>My hypothesis was Participant 3 would drive the Noodle golf ball the farthest using the Taylor Made r5 driver and my null hypothesis was that there was no significant statistical difference between all the variables. As you can see, the Srixon golf ball driven by Participant 2 with the Taylor Made r5 ended up going the farthest out of the four golf balls with an average of 251.92 yards. Based on the number of averaged yards the ball traveled the Noodle golf ball had an average roll time of 4.62 seconds and the Titleist golf ball driven by Doug Walls with the Cleveland Launcher came in wit an average of 240.25 yards. It had an average roll time of 4.24 seconds. The only statistically significant data was the participants.

THE EFFECT OF SPF ON UVA TRANSMITTANCE
Sana Cheema
Hays High School, Hays, KS

The purpose of this study was to determine the UVA transmittance of commercially available sunscreens of various Sun Protection Factors (SPFs). The wavelength of UVA radiation varies from 320 – 400 nm with almost complete transmission through the Earth’s ozone layer, atmosphere, glass, and most plastics. UVA radiation has been linked to melanoma initiation in Xiphophorus (a species of fish), yet until recently most sunscreens have been labeled solely in terms of the degree of UVB protection afforded. <br><br> Eighty-five samples of sunscreens (SPF = 15, 30, 50, 70, 100) were deposited in uniform layers on cellulose acetate film. These films were subsequently exposed to ultraviolet radiation with a peak wavelength of 380 nm. The intensity of UVA radiation passing through the cellulose acetate and sunscreen layer was measured using Vernier’s UVA probe in conjunction with a LabPro interface, and recorded using Vernier’s LoggerPro software.<br><br> The transmittance of the cellulose acetate was determined independently to ascertain the UVA intensity emitted by the source. Error propagation analysis was applied to the data from each set of UVA samples to calculate the standard deviation of the mean of the transmittance for each SPF value. It was found that, while the sunscreen decreased the UVA transmittance, the amount of UVA transmittance in no way depended on the labeled SPF of the sunscreen.<br><br> Although new FDA rules will be implemented this year, which apply SPF labeling to UVA and UVB transmission (“broad spectrum”), cost-conscious consumers may rely on older sunscreens with SPFs unrelated to UVA transmission. This issue demands public awareness.

BLOODY LASER
Danny Wing Mun Lin
Grants High School, Grants, NM

The purpose of this project is to determine glucose levels in substitute blood solutions by using a laser and Snell’s Law. It is hypothesized that the glucose levels can be determined by measuring the amount of refraction that occurs in the blood solution; the more glucose present, the higher the index of refraction. Substitute blood solutions, broken down into plasma, white blood cells and platelets, and red blood cells, are made using water, salts, albumin, and glucose. Each solution is placed inside a hand-made hollow glass prism and a laser light is sent through. The angle of minimum deviation is used in a version of Snell’s Law to calculate the index of refraction. The results indicate that the glucose concentrations are discernible by showing slight increases in the refractive indices in the solutions with increasing glucose levels, but they are varied and not entirely consistent. There are instances where the index of refraction drops or rises above the expected value. Therefore, the hypothesis is proven to be partially correct. Further experimentation has been conducted using an argon laser and increasing the distance between the tray and prism in an attempt to more accurately determine glucose levels, but results are much the same; with periods of expected values interspersed with inconsistencies. However, results from the experimentation with the argon laser suggest that the accuracy of the project can be improved by further increasing the distance between the tray and the prism. In addition, to better simulate actual conditions of blood in the body, human hemoglobin and serum proteins are going to be incorporated in the next experiment.

THE AERODYNAMICS OF PING PONG: THE MAGNUS EFFECT
Aly A. Ashraf
Coppell High School, Coppell, TX

Experienced Ping Pong Players have the ability to change the trajectory and motion of a Ping Pong ball by applying a certain amount of spin to their hit. This change in trajectory is due to the Magnus Effect. The Magnus Effect is a force created when a spinning object grabs the air around it, creating a whirlpool around itself, and causing a pressure difference on opposite sides of the object. This pressure difference generates Lift, as explained by the Bernoulli Principle. The Magnus Effect can also be seen in ball sports, racecars, and even heavier than air flying devices.<br><br>The purpose of the study was to confirm the existence of the Magnus Effect and how the Magnus Effect affects spinning objects. The experiment was done in two cohesive parts. The first tested the generation of a whirlpool and pressure difference in a wind tunnel, and the second, the presence of a Lift force. The wind tunnel testing included backspin and top spin of a Ping-Pong ball. The Top spin showed a tail of smoke curving down, and backspin displayed a tail of smoke curving upward, proving the existence of a pressure difference when compared to a normal control with no spin. The presence of a lift experiment was done with two paper cups that substituted the Ping-Pong ball, due to accuracy and similar air drag features, to prove the generation of a Lift force. In conclusion, a slower descent of the paper cups created by backspin proved the existence of a Lift force and the existence of the Magnus Effect.

AMATEUR LASER PHYSICS: ENGINEERING AFFORDABLE GAS LASERS TO DISCOVER WHAT AFFECTS OUTPUT POWER
Joseph Patrick Lee
Saint Peter's Academy, New Market, AL

This Project resulted from an observation that gas lasers are extremely expensive. The primary goals of this project were to design an affordable, useful gas laser and use it to find out what affects output power as well as the advantage of gas lasers that makes them marketable despite their cost.<br><br>It was known from research that the resonator gas was the most significant factor to output power, but beyond this my hypothesis was that length of the laser and input power were the biggest factors to output power.<br><br>The first half of this project was designing the lasers of two different lengths with a variable input power. Once the lasers were working a solar cell was used to measure the output power and the results were compared to test my hypothesis.<br><br>The results showed that length and input power affected output power the most. The engineering goals were met and my hypothesis was proven correct. It was learned that the reason gas lasers are marketable with other laser types is that their output characteristics make them suited for some applications where no other laser can substitute. The benefits of this project are two: first, the information learned from this project could be used as a base for further research and second, the lasers built are very practical. The lasers are useful as pump lights, micro-cutting, micro-engraving, further research, detecting improvised explosives, or any other application that requires short, intense pulses in the ultraviolet.

LIGHT SPEED III
Benjamin Luke Schuler
Wishek Public School, Wishek, ND

The purpose of my project was to see if different wavelengths affect the speed of light through different media.<br><br> My hypothesis was that as the wavelength of the laser went from higher to lower; the index of refraction would be higher, due to dispersion.<br><br> A different laser measuring system was used this year, making measurements much more accurate. I had a stationary protractor taped to the board so I did not have to readjust after each trial. Ten different media were prepared. Three angle measurements were taken for each of the three wavelengths for a total of 90 measurements. The angle of refraction was then measured relative to the normal. The speed of light was then determined.<br><br> According to my experiment, as the wavelength went from higher to lower; the index of refraction was higher. I expected this because of dispersion. The fastest measurement was the red laser through water, while the slowest was the violet laser through castor oil.

UNIDIRECTIONALIZATION OF PARTICULATE DISTRIBUTIONS IN ISOTROPIC D+D -> HE3+N REACTIONS UTILIZING DIFFERENTIAL ION VELOCITIES
Benjamin Craig Bartlett
Lexington High School, Lexington, SC

This continuation study was designed to induce unidirectionality in the particle distribution emanating from the output of an IEC (inertial electrostatic confinement) fusion reaction through the utilization of differential initial ion velocities. While the D+D->He3+n reaction normally outputs particles in a spherical, isotropic pattern when induced in an IEC device, it was hypothesized that a focusing effect could be induced in the neutron distribution emanating from the reactor by applying a momentum/velocity differential to the reactant ions. This was accomplished through the use of a directional ion source attached to a LINAC-style chamber setup for an IEC reactor. This ion source consisted of a single-body electrified tube and plate to accelerate ions through an increased voltage compared to the recurring ion set. A detailed predictive mathematical analysis, expressing chamber conditions initially as a set of separable differential equations, and later as a virtual set of overlapping spheres, was run to optimize bubble detector placement. Through the use of triple integration, the ratio of the smaller and larger sections of the spheres can be found, indicating the ratio of neutron radiation exiting the front compared to the rear of the reactor. The data agreed with the calculations, though some of the radiation superseded the energy detection boundaries of the BTI detectors; further experimentation is planned. The final result yielded a directionalization coefficient of 2.095, indicating unidirectionalization of neutrally charged radiation had occurred.

A NOVEL UNIVERSAL PHOTON AND RADIOACTIVE BETA PARTICLE DETECTOR: MULTIFUNCTIONALITY ENABLED BY WAVEFUNCTION ENGINEERING, PHOTOMODULATED ELECTRON TUNNELING, AND QUANTUM CONFINEMENT OF CHARGE CARRIER MOTION IN NANOWIRES
Saumil Bandyopadhyay
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, VA

This research reports the invention of a novel universal photo- and radioactive beta particle detector employing parallel arrays of 10- or 50-nm diameter semiconductor nanowires that are electrochemically self assembled. Measurements show that it can detect infrared light with high detectivity and high signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature. This is achieved through a new principle of quantum-mechanical wavefunction engineering to selectively promote electron-photon coupling over electron-phonon coupling. By integrating the detector with a 5 nm insulating layer through which photogenerated charge carriers have to quantum-mechanically tunnel, the signal-to-noise ratio is increased further while the standby power dissipation is reduced dramatically to make the detector superbly energy-efficient. The detector can also detect radioactive beta particles with high efficiency, despite the use of relatively impure materials, because of quantum-mechanical suppression of charge carrier scattering in nanowires. This universal detector is robust, rugged, reliable, inexpensive, amenable to mass production, and works without cryo-cooling -- all of which open up vast areas of application in night vision, buried mine detection, car collision avoidance systems, missile defense, astronomy, molecular spectroscopy, forensic science, monitoring of global warming, radiation therapy for cancer treatment, and homeland security, among others.

USING THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE SPEED OF SOUND TO DETECT VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN AIR
Connor Everett Tom
John W. North High School, Riverside, CA

The purpose of the research was to study the temperature dependence of the speed of sound in mixtures of non-ideal gases such as volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) with ideal gases such as air to assess whether an inexpensive VOC detector could be achieved using the temperature dependence of the speed of sound. The speed of sound in dilute gas mixtures has not been measured or studied in depth, and there are no models for the adiabatic index or the compressibility of gas mixtures. The hypothesis is that VOC’s are non-ideal gases, that VOC’s will produce measurable deviations in the speed of sound of air which is nearly ideal, and that simple models can be constructed for dilute VOC concentrations relevant to human health.<br><br> <br><br>The speed of sound, c, of ideal gases is given by c^2=gamma RT/m. Gamma is the adiabatic index, R is the Gas Constant, T is the temperature, and m is the molar mass of the mixture. The resonant frequency of a closed tube containing VOC/air mixtures was measured as a function of temperature from -20oC to 20oC. The ratio m(T)/gamma(T) was determined to 0.01%. VOC/air mixtures were studied in two limits: a) high concentration where m(T) changed due to condensation of the VOC, b) low concentration where m(T) was fixed and only gamma(T) changed.<br><br> <br><br>VOC/air mixtures as low as 2000 ppm had gamma(T) variations on the >0.05% level. Gamma(T) for acetone/air mixtures at different concentrations was obtained and a model proposed. Additional work on other VOC’s is needed to make a general model for dilute VOC/air mixtures. The data demonstrates the proof of concept for a novel, inexpensive VOC detector. A detector capable of resolving m(T)/gamma(T) variations of 0.001% would allow detection of many VOC’s at the 100-1000 ppm levels significant for human health.

A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO FORECASTING GEOMAGNETIC STORMS
Travis Le
Punahou School, Honolulu, HI

It is well established that Coronal Mass Ejections, massive magnetic bursts of plasma and solar wind, can produce geomagnetic storms lasting several hours to many days when they interact with Earth's magnetic field. As these storms can be extremely disastrous, this project aimed to investigate whether a neural network could be used to forecast these events and to determine how effective this was.<br><br>ACE Data at the first Lagrangian point were collected and preprocessed. Extensive VPython programs were then created to determine the input and output values. Using MATLAB, numerous combinations of the number of input nodes and hidden layers were tested a 100 times for three different neural network types. These include a numerical input-output network for predicting the maximum, minimum, and length of the storm (Type I), and two classification networks for classifying the type of storm (Type II) and whether the sign of the magnetic z-component flipped (Type III). The best 9 neural network selected in [# of inputs]_[# of layers] form were 1_3, 4_3, and 5_4 (Type I); 5_1, 6_3, and 8_1 for (Type II); and 5_6, 7_15, and 8_5 (Type III). While Type I and III had limited effectiveness, Type II was very effective with errors of about 0.6%. Further research reduced the errors, making the neural networks more effective. With even further research, these networks could have the potential to help space agencies and large corporations save money and to be used to create an early warning system for geomagnetic storms.

EXPLAINING THE ORIGIN OF THE 511 KEV LINE THROUGH THE SIMULATION OF GALAXIES WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF HELIUM SHELL-DETONATION SUPERNOVAE
Rayan AbdulRahman Alrubaish
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, Western, SAUDI ARABIA

The 511 KeV line is the first type of gamma rays detected on earth that are emitted as the result of electro-positron annihilation. Since the detection of this line, many explanations have been proposed for the origin of the 511 KeV line. This research examines the origin of the 511 KeV line as radioactivity from stellar nuclei-synthesis through the addition of helium-shell detonation white dwarf supernovae (Type .Ia) to previously made calculations. A Monte Carlo Simulation is utilized to generate random numbers in accordance to the spatial, height, and flux distribution for each type of supernovae. Random numbers were generated for the age and angle of each supernovae. Following, sample galaxies were generated under the range of 300 supernovae per galaxy. COMPTEL gamma-ray maps and the galaxy’s six historical supernovae were employed to compare simulated and historical data for consistency. This study reveals the contribution of Type .Ia supernovae to the amount of positron production in the galaxy. A group of 955 supernovae out of 100,000 has generated 65% of the simulated 511 KeV line flux. The comparison of this data to the simulated data shows the heavy contribution of type .Ia supernovae to the 511 KeV line emissions. In the future, type .Ia supernovae will be studied extensively to detect the special features that enable it to emit a high quantity of positrons. Moreover, research will be developed to determine the cause resulting type .Ia supernovae with an abundance of calcium-44 within the supernovae remnants.

The aim of this project is to implement the multiparty card game Bridge with quantum mechanics to create a communication technique for Bridge partners which is superior to the existing classical techniques under the condition that the technique does not violate the principles of the game. This was done firstly by theoretically constructing a quantum entanglement based communication protocol adapted for Bridge and secondly by experimentally demonstrating the superiority of the Quantum Bridge technique. <br><br> The theoretical quantum protocol relies on photon polarization correlations and the fact that entanglement does not yield side channels of communication. The experimental procedure uses laboratory techniques such as polarization analysis, single photon detection and coincidence measurements to experimentally obtain the theoretical predictions. <br><br> Theoretical results predict that Quantum Bridge outperforms classical Bridge for all non-trivial parametric values. The prediction was initially not confirmed by the experimental data. Significant deviations from the predicted result lead to the discovery of several experimental errors such as failed generation of parameter, optical phase shifts, imperfect bell state and incorrect data analysis. Multiple reconstructions of the experimental setup finally yielded an on average 0.6% deviation from the theoretical prediction which in two independent experiments very accurately confirmed the theoretical prediction.<br><br> The field of quantum optics and quantum information theory has been criticized for not having created practical application. Quantum Bridge yields such an everyday application through creating the first non-tailored quantum game.

THE EFFECT OF WATER LOCATION ON SALINITY BASED UPON INDEX OF REFRACTION
Jessica Lee Williams
Ocean Springs High School, Ocean Springs, MS

This project investigated the effect of water location on salinity based upon index of refraction. I sampled a diverse cross section of eight samples from the Ocean-Springs Biloxi area. I hypothesize that water sample 7 will have the lowest salinity (based upon index of refraction) because, of the eight samples collected, sample 7 was the most landlocked location. To measure the index of refraction of each water solution, I directed a laser through a triangular glass prism made of microscope slides. When there was no liquid in the prism, the ray was straight ahead; however, when there was liquid in the prism, the ray was diverted. Using the distance of the diverted ray, I was able to calculate the angle of minimum deviation and input that angle into a formula which calculated the index of refraction. For control in my experiment, I prepared concentrated salt solutions and compared the index of refractions of the concentrated solutions to the index of refractions of the collected water samples. After analyzing my results, I found that the water from the Ocean-Springs Biloxi Bridge had the highest index of refraction and the water from Keesler Marina had the lowest index of refraction. My data did not support my hypothesis because the sample that had the lowest index of refraction was not Sample 7. I found these results quite interesting because all of these water areas were connected; none of them were isolated from the others yet the index of refraction values did vary.

COOLING DOWN THE SUNSHINE
Nicole Louw
Holy Spirit Catholic High School, Tuscaloosa, AL

In this project, the effect that solar-paneled attic fans have on the temperature of a model house was tested. This was in order to understand how both the attic and the room’s temperature change based on the fans or their absence. It was hypothesized that the temperature of the attic would remain warmer than that of the room, although being more severely affected by the fans. After building a house installed with the attic fans, thermometers, and a ceiling, the experiment was conducted. The project consisted of three stages. During each of these stages, a light was used as a controllable substitution for the sun. In stage one, the fans were turned on, in stage two, they were turned off, and in stage three they were covered. Throughout the experiment, the ambient temperature was taken along with the temperature of the attic and room. After performing the experiment, the data showed that the change in temperature between stages of the room was one third of that in the attic, proving that the room’s change in temperature was dependent on the attic’s change in temperature. This analysis allowed for an explanation of the affirmation of the hypothesis in that, the attic was more severely affected by the fans because the attic and room are separated by a ceiling. The temperature of the room remained lower than that of the attic because of the fact that its change could only reach one-third of the attic’s change in temperature between stages.

TRIBOMAGNETIC CONNECTION SYSTEM
Tansel Baran Yasar
Bahcesehir High School for Science and Technology, Istanbul, TURKEY

When two books are assembled by putting every single page of one book between the two pages of other book, resulting force of friction between the pages is increased dramatically. Similarly, tribomagnetic connection system replaces the paper pages with metal plates and utilizes magnetic and friction forces to create an adjustable locking mechanism.<br><br>The system consists of two identical half-cells composed of a stack of ferromagnetic plates mounted on a metal shaft. Those parts are merged by putting the plates of one part into the spaces between the plates of another. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied on the plates, they compress. Correspondingly, friction force between them significantly increases.<br><br>First, a theoretical model was established which predicts the behaviour of the system under different conditions. Then, experiments were conducted to test the model. <br><br>In the experimental parts performed in the school, three different types of plates were used: electrical steel, cold-rolled iron and stainless steel. After experimentation, it is noticed that the most appropriate material among them due to the magnetic and surface properties is cold-rolled iron. Next, the effect of three variables on the minimum required force to separate the system was investigated: magnitude of the applied magnetic field, number of plates on each half-cell and surface roughness of the plates. <br><br>In the follow-up experiments conducted in a research institution, effect of the magnitude of applied magnetic field on systems made of galvanized iron and stainless steel has been investigated precisely. <br><br>Experimental results fit the theoretical model. Also, several application fields of the system were developed.

THE STRANGE CASE OF WASP-43B
Christian Drew
La Joya Community High School, Avondale, AZ

A research program to investigate the nature of the transiting exoplanet designated as WASP-43b is described. WASP-43b was originally identified using the WASP Southern telescope located in South Africa in 2010. WASP-43 is a young main sequence star of spectral class K7 V. The planet WASP-43b has been determined to have a mass 1.78 times the mass of Jupiter but a diameter only 93% as great. It orbits its star in 19.2 hours, and has the smallest orbital radius of any known exoplanet. Once during each orbit, WASP-43b transits its star, producing a dimming on the order of 3%. Since the official announcement of its discovery in April of 2011 it has been studied by the astronomical community. The author noticed that many of the published light curves the transits exhibited small abnormalities not consistent with the passage of a single object across its star or a star of constant luminosity. The author conducted a photometric study of this star system using a SBIG ST7 thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera mounted to a 12 inch Meade LX200 Schmidt Cassegrain telescope. The study was conducted from a relatively dark site 42 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. Five separate observations of the passage of the planet across the star WASP-43 as well as ten additional observations of the star at other times were conducted by the author in order to check the star’s variabilty. They confirmed the presence of these abnormalities. In this paper the author will discuss possible interpretations of this data.

S.S.S: SCIENCE SERVES STUDENT A NEW METHOD OF READING AND WRITING IN SCHOOL TO SOLVE MOST OF THE STUDENTS’ AND THE PUPILS’ PROBLEMS
Ahmed Boubaker Farah
preparatory Pioneer School, Gabes, Gabes, TUNISIA

Lots of students and pupils are complaining about using too many books and copybooks and the problems related to the heaviness and the mess it causes. So I decided to find a solution to this problem using a technique called “light coloring”. The basic two rules about light coloring are that white light is composed of three “additive” colors: Red, blue and green. The second one says that any object gets it color from absorbing all white light’s components and reflects only the components of its color. Using these main two rules and some others I managed to create a new method of reading and writing for students and pupils that will allow them to use only half the number of the books and notebooks they use. To use this new method consists in using two things. First, two pairs of colored glasses and second some special pens. You can write for example a subject using only red pens (with different shades if you want) on a copybook. Then write another subject all the way over the first one with another color (green for example). Using your glasses, you’ll be able to read one without seeing the other. The benefits of this method are countless. If everyone used it, it will give solution to all students’ problems, put end to exams cheating, save millions of trees from being logged yearly to produce wood and paper and much more…

STUDY OF BIEFELD–BROWN EFFECT: CAPACITORS CAN FLY
Anton Kutlin, Mikhail Mlodik, 
Municipal Lyceum No. 40, Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod region, RUSSIA

In the beginning of the 20th century Thomas Brown discovered the effect of appearance of motive force in air capacitor when high voltage is applied to plates (electrodes), known nowadays as the Biefeld–Brown effect. Although a long time has passed since this discovery, the effect has not had the correct quantitative theory. Our main hypothesis is the suggestion that motive force is caused by ion wind.<br><br>According to our model, charged particles which occur between electrodes get their momentum due to acceleration in the electric field, and then give part of this momentum to neutral particles in inter-electrode volume because of collisions. The resulting momentum of capacitor is opposite to the summarized momentum of all neutral particles. Therefore motive force appears and capacitors can fly. <br><br> Due to the suggested hypothesis, we developed the theoretical model for this effect. Our model demonstrates the dependence of motive force value on a number of parameters such as form and the relative position of electrodes, voltage, and parameters of inter-electrode medium. To verify our theory, we created an installation which included a high voltage source, milliamperemeter, air capacitor, electronic scales, lever, and liquid damper. During the numerous experiments that we did; the voltage, geometric arrangement, and parameters of inter–electrode medium were varied, and thus the correctness of our theoretical model was confirmed. It was actually demonstrated as well that motive force is produced by ion wind. <br><br> The efficiency of our engine based on the Biefeld–Brown effect which we theoretically predicted and experimentally measured, inspires hope for a wide range of its applications. We also hope to explain some natural phenomena like strong Venusian winds using our theory.

THE "BAT" MAN
Dakota Austin Everett Key, Jake Evans, 
Vici High School, Vici, OK

The purpose of our experiment was to see which baseball bat; Wood, BBCOR aluminum, or Standard aluminum will help you on average, hit a baseball the furthest. We hypothesized that the standard aluminum would on average hit the baseball the furthest and the BBCOR would be the second furthest leaving the wood on average, at the shortest distance hit. In our experiment we hit with our three different bats [Wood, BBCOR aluminum, and Standard aluminum (all the same length, 32” and all the same weight 29 ounces)] off a hitting tee ten times each with each bat. We also took five practice cuts with each bat before hitting with it. Once we hit ten baseballs with a bat we used a stake and string to make sure the path the measuring wheel took to each ball from home plate was straight. We repeated that process for each bat, and for each hitter, making the condition the same for each, and recorded our findings. In conclusion our hypothesis was correct, the standard Aluminum on average beat the BBCOR aluminum by about ten feet and the wood on average by twenty feet. If we could do this project again we would conduct this experiment at a softball field so the pitcher’s mound wouldn’t affect any results. We’ve learned that according to our test the new change in bats (BBCOR) will drastically change the offensive game of baseball in high school.

STUDY OF TECHNIQUES OF RING ELECTROMAGNETIC DRIVE AND ITS MODEL DESIGN
Jiajun Cao, Yifan Wu, Wei Li
High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, CHINA

The project studies the principle of a ring electromagnetic drive (RED). It is an innovative ring drive with non-axle structure. It is accomplished by modifying the coil magnetic path and utilizing a differential drive method and an ingenious control circuit. The RED is technically based on a coil gun while changing the straight propulsion path into a ring one and forming a circulating pathway of an non-axle driving mechanism. Three models were fabricated in this project. Model 1 proves the feasibility of the RED. Model 2 is more flexible than model 1 in the adjustment of slew direction and speed. Model 3 is better performed in power output and it simulates an RED application in a large scaled slew mechanism. A series of experiments have been done to research the effect of the magnetic path design and magnetic media on the magnetic field. The magnetic field of electromagnet used in models has been scanned by the Hall sensors of DIS experimental system and Lab Quest experimental system and its result proved a difference of magnetic field intensity has been produced at the two sides of the coils.The energy conversion efficiency of the models has also been increased via the experiments, and the efficiency of model 2 can reach 33.76%. The RED with the advantage of hollow inner structure can output its power by wheel bearings,which can be applied to large slew mechanisms. Comparing with conventional motor drives, the RED has advantages of simple structure, high efficiency in energy conversion, large torque output and high reliability.

INFLUENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD ON FREE SURFACE FERROFLUID FLOW
Michal Habera, Michal Fabian, 
Gymnazium sv. Tomasa Akvinskeho, Kosice, SLOVAKIA

In spite of many investigations on nonmagnetic fluids, experimental observation and theoretical explanation of the flow of ferrofluid with free surface, forming droplets and the influence of magnetic field on these phenomena is attractive and very poorly understood area of science. <br><br>In our experiments we observed ferrofluid leaving a nozzle at the bottom of an cylindrical container. Ferrofluid was influenced by magnetic field parallel or perpendicular to jet and recorded by high-speed video camera with 1200fps. In order to be able to analyze recorded amount of data we developed JAVA-based macro for ImageJ software. Which enable us to automatically analyze intact jet length, number of created droplets, sizes of droplets and velocity of perturbations growing on the jet.<br><br>In dripping regime – if fluid is released very slowly from a nozzle - we observed influence of parallel and perpendicular magnetic field strength on the shape, volume and drop formation dynamics. We found increase of drop elongation coefficient and decrease of drop volume with increasing magnetic field strength. We directly compare drops volume measurements with suggested quasi-static theoretical model. At a little bit larger velocity at the nozzle, applying magnetic field cause dripping to jetting transition, while in jetting regime drop size becomes significantly smaller. At velocities about 1 m.s-1 applied magnetic field in jetting regime induces sudden increase in break-up length.<br><br>Our results could be applied in ferrofluid printing devices development. To explain measured influence of magnetic field strength on dynamics of drop separation process we plan to perform numerical simulation.

We were interested in the hunting way of archerfish hit the target by shooting water, and tried to reproduce the situation by a simple experimental setup. When we filled a tank with water and projected a water-jet under the water-surface by a nozzle, we found a new phenomenon that the water in the tank gradually decreased. In order to clarify the reason of the water-level decrease, we studied experimentally the relation between the velocity of the water-jet and the amount of the decreased water.<br><br>Detailed experiment revealed that the water-jet involved the surrounding water near the water-surface and transported it into the air. It should be noted that the amount of the transported water was greater than that of the original water-jet. We also have derived an equation to describe the amount of the transported water Q by using fluid mechanics,<br><br>Q =klv (Ddv/V )^(3/4)<br><br>where k is the constant defined by this experiment, l is the distance from the water-surface to the nozzle, d is the diameter of the water-jet, v is the velocity of the water-jet, and D and V are the density and viscosity of the fluid, respectively. <br><br>Moreover, we examined the application of this phenomenon to collect the spilling crude oil on the sea surface. According to the additional experiment by putting oil on the water surface and the equation, we estimated the necessary time to collect crude oil spilling on the Gulf of Mexico; 10 fire engines would work for about 1 year.

REVERSE ORDERING IN DYNAMICAL TWO-DIMENSIONAL HOPPER FLOW
Hao-Wen Dong, Chen-Chieh Ping, 
The Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung City, CHINESE TAIPEI

We study the exit ordering of grains in gravity driven flow through two-dimensional hoppers of different hopper angle and outlet size with adjustable reclining angle. We observe a reverse ordering phenomenon such that grains entering the hopper at earlier times may not come out earlier. We record the entry order and exit order of the grains and calculate the degree of reverse ordering which is found to increase with increasing hopper angle, decreasing reclining angle, and increasing hopper outlet size. In order to find the mechanism of reverse ordering, we construct maps which register the entry order and exit order according to the position of the grain in the hopper before the flow. By comparing the exit order map and the entry order map we locate the regions where grains undergo reverse ordering. From the trajectories of the grains in the reverse ordering regions, we find that they take part in avalanches at the surface on their way to the exit. Hence, it is the dynamical process of surface avalanche that reverse the exit order of the grain when they flow out of the hopper. These results may be useful for special hopper design in agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to reduce or to enhance reverse ordering of materials for specific purposes.

DIFFERENTIAL PHOTOMETRY OF V1191 CYGNUS
Manav Singh Kohli, James Lavery, 
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Our goal was to create a light curve using observations of the close-contact eclipsing binary star V1191 CYGNUS. We began our work by calibrating our telescope using polar alignment and Vega as our reference star. Next, dark, flat and bias frames were collected in order to later reduce pixel bias. After slewing the telescope to V1191 CYGNUS we initiated the auto-guiding feature of the telescope, which allowed it to follow the star during the night. However, the strong winds, moist air and cloud cover affected the telescope’s tracking capabilities and as the telescope was unable to find V1191 CYGNUS, we lost many data. Fortunately, we noticed the poor quality of the pictures and manually slewed the telescope to the star. Finally, we reduced the data using CCDSoft and AIP4WIN. After extracting data from the pictures, we created light curves of V1191 CYGNUS and its secondary star. The curves suggested that the stars are in an eclipsing binary pair with a period of approximately 0.31 Julian days. After researching and analyzing previous data, we hypothesized that mass transfer is not primarily a one way, but rather a two-way transfer between the primary and secondary star.

SEARCHING FOR EXOMOONS ORBITING KEPLER MISSION EXOPLANETS USING TRANSIT TIMING AND TRANSIT DURATION VARIATION SIGNALS
Hunter Dong, William Chan, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

The Kepler satellite is currently the most advanced space-based telescope and has detected over 1000 exoplanet candidates. The next step is to determine if Kepler is sophisticated enough to detect exomoons orbiting these exoplanets. This study calculates the variation in velocity and timing of the transit of planet Kepler-8b. The timing variations are determined by using the very sharp beginning and end points of individual transits to find transit midpoints through averaging. The root-mean-square Transit-Timing Variation (TTV) and Transit-Duration Variation (TDV) signals calculated are analyzed using Kipping’s (2011) formula, to first discover the possible presence of a moon, and then to calculate the potential semi-major axis and mass of the moon. To determine if the exomoon’s semi-major axis is viable, the planet’s Roche limit is calculated as the lower limit of the semi-major axis, and the Hill radius is calculated as the upper limit. Kepler-8b was found to have TTV and TDV amplitudes of 64.0 RMS seconds and 122.7 RMS seconds, respectively. These results are significant when compared to the calculated uncertainties. It was found that these signals indicate the strong possibility of an exomoon orbiting at one-third of the planet’s Hill radius, above the Roche limit, and the mass to be one-tenth the mass of Kepler-8b. Other applications of this method include using Kepler satellite data to detect many sources of variations including solar activity, as well as new planets in known planetary systems, in addition moons orbiting exoplanets.

Chemists and physicists alike have been fascinated by the effect of magnetic fields on substances, objects and materials for centuries. The ubiquity of water, the essence of life, makes it a substance of high research value and importance. Through investigation of the influence of static fields in the range of 0-1T, molecular changes and macroscopic conversions are probed and analysed.<br><br>Experimental work studying molecular changes used a 0-1T Halbach Cylinder as a flux source. H-NMR operating at 600.13MHz, showed spin relaxation scales with downfield displacement of 8.5Hz and a chemical-shift of .01ppm, confirming induced-magnetisation in the nuclear spins of the molecules. Increased Hydrogen-bonding is suggested.<br><br>Effects of a 1T field on electrochemical reactions in aqueous based CuSO4 were investigated by use of Cyclic Voltammetry.

In August 2011, a group of physicists (Lemoult et al) achieved the focusing of sound, in the audible range, beyond the diffraction limit. This process was remarkable because the physicists used a square array of 49 empty soft drink cans acting as acoustic resonators. Using ‘Time Reversal Acoustics’ they were able to focus sound to a focal spot a few centimeters above the centre can in the array.<br><br>This project began by attempting to verify the results of Lemoult et al. using apparatus and equipment borrowed from school and home, self-built audio circuits and freeware available from the internet. It proved possible to observe the predicted focal spot. In addition a study was made of the response of the individual cans within the array to the driving sound waves.<br><br>The work was extended to a hexagonal array of cans, the first time that this arrangement has been studied. It was expected that the greater symmetry of the hexagonal array was better suited to my experimental systems which then used two microphones, software limited to processing two channels and a stereo amplifier linked to pairs of speakers. The investigations on the array included examining the responses of individual cans as before. Once again, evidence was found of focusing of sound a few centimeters above the central can. <br><br>The potential of this project lies in the search for a cheap, efficient form of acoustic metamaterial. Such a discovery would revolutionize areas such as acoustic cloaking, acoustic actuator systems, and medical ultrasound.

FARNSWORTH FUSOR
Michal Racko
Jozef Lettrich Secondary Grammar School, Martin, SLOVAKIA

The main goal of our project was to construct the Farnsworth fusor, a simple device where fusion of deuterium nuclei may occur and to statistically prove the fusion in the device. We managed to construct the fusor in recipient from steel with diameter of 70 mm and high of 80 mm which is one of the smallest fusors ever built. In this device we achieved conditions needed for fusion, such as stable discharge in pure deuterium at voltage of 10-30 kV and current of 3,5 – 6 mA in a suitable geometry of electrodes. Deuterium gas was produced by electrolysis of heavy water using PEM cell. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Polymer Electrolyte Membrane<br><br>(PEM) electrolyzer was used to produce deuterium gas for fusor. Gained deuterium was then purified and dried in our self designed and built feeding system. Neutrons were detected using a moderated LiI scintillation detector. Also we managed to prove fusion at voltage of less than 11 kV, which is probably the lowest voltage with which man managed to achieve fusion. Our measurements show <br><br>exponential dependency of neutron yield on voltage. The yield doubles after each approximately 4 kV in range 10-30 kV. The most limiting factor in the device is the central electrode which is cooling down the plasma around it. This problem can be solved by using a virtual cathode.

X-RAY MEASUREMENTS OF TYCHO SUPERNOVA REMNANT'S DYNAMICS
Michaela Brchnelova
Gymnazium Hubeneho 23, Bratislava, SLOVAKIA

In the following work we present X-ray dynamics measurements of the Tycho’s supernova remnant G120.1+01.4. We compare observations and spectra from 2005 and 2009 archived in XMM Newton Science Archive in order to determine differences caused by collision with surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) as well as by remnant’s own expansion. We have calculated the azimuthal expansion of remnant’s edges to vary from 0.194 arcsec/yr to 0.438 arcsec/yr, while the highest values are found to have the azimuth of about 60° in the south-east and the lowest expansion overall is estimated on the north. Comparison of fluxes has shown that the highest estimated energy gain of 3.1 times was measured in reverse shock region around the azimuth of 300° in the energy range from 6.1 keV to 8 keV, whereas the highest energy loss was found to be in the same energy range in forward shock region with the azimuth of approximately 70° reaching 2.4 times lower energy compared with the values from 2005. We have also defined the most abundant heavy elements within energy scale from 200 eV to 8 keV, which are identified through spectral lines to be Fe XVIII (0.849 keV), Mg XI and XII (1.34 keV, 1.46 keV), Si XIII (1.83 keV), S XV (2.41 keV, 2.86 keV) and Ca XIX (3.84 keV).

NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK: SENSING NEURON POTENTIAL

In my project I examined the simulation of registering brain neurons’ potentials with planar microelectrodes. Such biosensors are used in biomedicine to monitor neuronal signal and diagnose neurological diseases. The appearance of biopotentials in neurons and their propagation on neuronal networks are registered by microelectrode or their matrix. However, a problem of decoding signals generated by several neurons exists. Moreover, dimensions of microelectrode are comparable with cell size in existing biosensors.<br><br> To describe quantitative indicators of neuronal signals and design optimized neurobiosensor in the future, an experimental prototype was developed, which was intended for simulation of registration of neuronal electrical signals on planar microelectrodes of various shapes and dimensions. Nerve cell was simulated by current dipole (soma and axon) and was placed in a fixed position in a vessel with an electrolyte, signals on modeling neuron being emitted from a generator. The dependence of signals on the relative position of electrode and the signal source, the shape and dimension of the electrode, and the configuration of model neurons were researched.<br><br> I experimentally measured the dependence of the extracellular potential magnitude on the distance to the electrode, which fits very well with theoretical predictions. The distorted shape of recorded signals was studied via generation by a neuron of a single pulse and sequences of pulses. The comparison of obtained results with the signals of multi-electrode biosensors shows the adequacy of the proposed model and the need to account for the non-locality of measurements via the interpretation of signals received from such biosensors.

THE EFFECT OF THE FORCE OF GRAVITY CREATING BLUESHIFT GALAXIES IN A REDSHIFT UNIVERSE
Allison Noel LeBleu
Agape Christian Academy, Lake Charles, LA

Why do some galaxies in the Local Group demonstrate a blueshift instead of a redshift and therefore are not expanding along with the rest of the Universe? The purpose of this study is to see if Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation will explain the observed blueshift of some of the galaxies in the Local Group. The acceleration of gravity should be consistently greater among the galaxies in a particular galaxy cluster than other galaxies outside of that galaxy cluster. Using Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, I calculated 12 forces of gravity for galaxies in the Local Group and I calculated 12 forces of gravity for galaxies that are outside of the Local Group. I made a table and graphs to compare the mean and median forces of gravity between the 2 groups. I applied the t-Test to see if the results could be repeated in other galaxy clusters. The mean force of gravity within the Local Group was substantially greater than the mean force of gravity outside the group. This acceleration of gravity causes the blueshift of some of the galaxies in the Local Group. The t-Test marginally failed to reject the null hypothesis but was nearly at the 95% level of confidence. Since the mean force of gravity found inside the Local Group is substantially greater and the t-Test results are close to the 95% level of confidence, using Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation does show that there is a gravitational force in galaxy clusters binding them together even as the universe is expanding. A foundational understanding of Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is the basis for understanding the structure of the Universe.

SOUND ABSORPTION AROUND YOU
Tyler Michael Abshire
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

When you attend a sport event at such places as arenas or gymnasiums, have you ever noticed how poor the audio quality is; particularly when music is played? There are several factors resulting in the poor quality. The facility may have hard, smooth surfaces, there could be a speaker that has gone bad, or there may even be low-hanging places, resulting in a “bass-trap.” Nevertheless, the only way to improve the quality is to acoustically treat the facility with sound-absorbing materials.<br><br> This study uncovers what common material is preeminent for absorbing unwanted frequencies. According to acousticalsurfaces.com, a more fibrous material will absorb more sound than a harder material. Five relatively common materials were obtained and individually molded to an aluminum support frame. SPL levels were taken from inside of the enclosure and recorded. These levels were then compared to a control set of levels which were taken without a material between the SPL meter and the audio source. A 2-tailed, paired T-Test was then performed and values < 0.05 were considered significant. <br><br> Each material had its own pros and cons as certain materials absorbed a specific range of frequencies more sufficiently than others. In conclusion, this study has proven what material is preeminent for the user’s requirements and is dependent on what sort of acoustic treatment is needed. For example, should a facility have low (bass) frequency issues, one material would be sufficient. However, if a facility has high (treble) frequency issues, then a different material would be needed. Factors such as price, placement, and even weight of the material should also be taken into account before a decision is made on what material is to be used.

NEW AND IMPROVED INSIGHTS INTO THE MICROCOSM: MULTIMODAL LIGHT MICROSCOPY WITH BRIGHT, DARKFIELD AND PHASE CONTRAST, PART 2: AXIAL PHASE-DARKFIELD CONTRAST (APDC), VARIABLE PHASE-BRIGHTFIELD CONTRAST (VPBC) AND UNIVERSAL VARIABLE BRIGHT-DARKFIELD CONTRAST (UVBDC)
Timm Piper
Martin-von-Cochem-Gymnasium, Cochem, GERMANY

In continuation of my elaborations of 2011, axial phase-darkfield contrast (APDC) was created as a further technique for improved imaging in light microscopy. Phase contrast lenses were fitted with centric light stoppers near the phase plate; particular light masks consisting of light annuli for phase contrast and additional centric outlets for axial darkfield were inserted into condensers. Fine details at the resolution limit of the optical system could be revealed in enhanced accuracy. <br><br>Modified light masks were also created for combinations of phase contrast and brightfield (variable phase-brightfield-contrast, VPBC). In this special arrangement, halo artifacts were strongly reduced and the contrast could be optimally adjusted to the specimen´s density. <br><br>In order to use all my methods with any type of laboratory microscope, equipped with highest magnifying objectives and condensers up to a numerical aperture of 1.4 circa 80 differently designed light masks were calculated and manufactured as inserts for such condensers. <br><br>Lastly, universal bright-darkfield contrast (UBDC) was developed based on a zoom condenser with particular light masks and a specially designed contrast tube. Variable phase imaging could now be achieved purified from artifacts carried out with glass and mirror lenses without using a phase plate. <br><br>In addition to these tasks, first practical evaluations were made in order to combine interference contrast with phase contrast or darkfield.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE ROUTE TO CHAOS IN CHUA’S CIRCUIT
Clayton William Davis
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Chaos is primarily taught as a purely mathematical topic, often at the expense of physical examples. A physical, tangible model that demonstrates chaos and period doubling bifurcations would be a great aid when teaching chaos. An electronic circuit is an ideal medium for the creation of such a model. A chaotic circuit can be constructed using simple circuit components relatively inexpensively. For this demonstration, Chua’s circuit was chosen for the model as it displays a wide array of chaotic behavior and has been thoroughly researched mathematically. Although a bifurcation diagram has been generated for the circuit using a computer, no diagram has been measured experimentally. A physical Chua’s circuit was constructed and tested through a range for C, the conductance of the circuit’s potentiometer. The behavior of the circuit at various values of C was analyzed using a phase plot, Poincaré plot, and Fast Fourier Transform. A new technique that used a sinusoidal regression to determine the period was used to create the Poincaré plots. The Poincaré plots were used to construct a bifurcation diagram, the first created experimentally for Chua’s circuit. The circuit successfully demonstrated period doubling bifurcations, and an experimental value for Feigenbaum’s constant was calculated. Additionally, the circuit exhibited period three, confirming the presence of chaos. After the period doubling and period three, the circuit had a periodic window that suggested the onset of an alternate route to chaos

THE VERTICAL VS. HORIZONTAL WIND TURBINE
Joshua Ray Eudave
Eastlake High School, El Paso, TX

The title of my project is The Vertical vs. The Horizontal Wind Turbine. The purpose of my project is to find out how a levitating vertical axis wind turbine compares to a conventional ball bearing vertical axis wind turbine and the vertical axis wind turbine's general performance to a horizontal axis wind turbines's performance. The way I tested these wind turbines' efficiency was through measuring the wind turbines R.P.M. (Rotations per Minute). I made the diameter of all the turbines the same so the reading would be accurate and fair to all turbines. I tested this by blowing air from a vacuum exhaust or a leaf blower. I tested the turbines and set wind speed intervals of 5 mph starting at 5 mph and ending at 30 mph. I limited the wind speeds at 30 mph because that is roughly the average wind speed commercial wind farms experience throughout the year. After testing all three turbines and finding their average R.P.M, I discovered the reasoning behind the use of horizontal axis wind turbines. The horizontal not only thrived in low wind speeds, averaging out 783 R.P.M., but also took advantage of higher wind speeds as the turbine averaged out a whooping 1218 R.P.M. that is roughly a 206% increase from the ball bearing vertical axis wind turbine and a 235% increase from the levitating vertical axis wind turbine. From the vertical axis wind turbines, I found the levitating axis wind turbine was the slowest of all the turbines losing as much as 119 R.P.M. at one point to the ball bearing vertical axis wind turbine.

COOL CORE BIAS IN SUNYAEV-ZEL'DOVICH GALAXY CLUSTER SURVEYS
Henry Wanjune Lin
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys search for patches of blue-shifted cosmic microwave background due to the presence of massive clusters of galaxies. In an effort to quantify possible biases in these new surveys, we model thousands of relaxed galaxy clusters via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. "Cool core" density perturbations were added to the centers of each cluster and hydrostatic equilibrium was assumed to calculate the response of the cluster profiles to this addition. Further simulations were employed to perform mock SZ observations of both the perturbed (cool core) and unperturbed (non-cool core) clusters. <br><br>We find that SZ surveys are slightly biased towards detecting cool core clusters: the median change in the signal-to-noise ratio is 1.3%, though in 10% of these systems, the bias is greater than 8%. Consequently, both the mass of cool core clusters and the cool core fraction may be overestimated by ~5% and ~1%, respectively. Since most cool cores contain active galactic nuclei, we calculate the effect of these radio-loud sources on the SZ signal by adding point sources to the mock clusters. We find that the presence of radio-loud active galactic nuclei generally reduces the cool core bias, sometimes to the sub-percent level. These results support the claim that SZ-selected samples are ideal for cosmological or astrophysical analysis.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY EMERGING FROM DIAMAGNETISM AND NON-FERMI LIQUID BEHAVIOR IN A NEW CLASS OF CHALCOGENIDES
Vincent Shian Cao
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Purpose: Heavy transition metal materials are currently among the most current and important areas in condensed matter physics due to strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). SOC rigorously competes with other interactions, which generates unexpected insulating states in heavy transition metal oxides. However, when oxygen is replaced by a chalcogenide, novel states with more metallic characteristics may occur. It is this premise that motivates this study.<br><br>Procedure: Single-crystal growth synthesis using slow-cooling methods and flux techniques was conducted in order to synthesize Ir3Te8 single crystals. X-Ray Diffraction methods were performed in order to determine crystal structures. A Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersion X-Ray were used to take surface images of crystal structures and to examine chemical composition of crystals. Resistivity and heat capacity measurements were conducted in a Physical Property Measurement System over a wide temperature range (1.7K-700K), and magnetization measurements were conducted in a Magnetic Property Measurement System over a wide temperature range (0.5K-700K)<br><br>Data: In this study, superconductivity was observed at 1.8K, unusual normal-state diamagnetism was observed, linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity up to 700K was observed, and a structural change from cubic to rhombohedral was observed at 350K.<br><br>Conclusions: The simultaneous occurence of superconductivity, linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, structural change, and diamagnetism suggests novel physics associated with SOC. This study provides motivation for furthering research on heavy transition metals and chalcogenides and opens avenues for new discoveries important for future technological applications.

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF TIME DILATION IN QUASAR MICROVARIABILITY
Steven Kaichi Okada
Maui High School, Kahului, HI

In this experiment, I investigated the microvariability and effects of time dilation in quasar target OJ 287. In a recent study, quasars have been shown to be exempt from the effects of the time dilation which would be expected of objects moving at relativistic speeds (Hawkins 2010). My project sought to explore OJ 287's microvariability over a short-period time scale and analyze the quasar's power spectra for the effects of time dilation.<br><br>My procedures involved selecting a quasar target, observing that target on a short-period time scale, and completing a light curve and Fourier Transform to analyze the power spectra of the quasar. The light curve analysis confirmed that OJ 287 was an optically violent variable quasar and varied over a 7 hour time scale by a factor of 6.4%. The Fourier analysis showed that there were unexpected differences between the power spectra of the red and infrared wavelengths. Using a check star as a limit for error, one difference (18.557483, 2.253245) was determined to be intrinsic to the quasar.<br><br>The differences between the power spectra of different wavelengths may have affected previous attempts to determine quasar time dilation. Thus, these results point to the thought that quasars may be subject to time dilation as consistent with current models, but variability interferes with this measurement. Future research in this area will provide insight into the way objects at astronomical distances behave and whether or not our physics models hold true in all instances.

FOOT STRIKE PATTERNS DURING RUNNING
Lucinda M. Peng
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

Finding an efficient and safer running technique has become an increasingly important area of interest in both scientific and running communities. However, the link between running technique (e.g., foot strike patterns) and injury remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate how different foot strike patterns affect the forces, movements and injury during running in high school long-distance runners, and to test the belief that a forefoot strike pattern would decrease overall impulses and probability of injury.<br><br>The ten participants had retroreflective markers placed over bony landmarks on their lower body that were tracked by a motion capture camera system. Each participant then ran on the treadmill for five minutes with the cameras tracking their movements. Their 5-kilometer personal record and injuries from running in the past four years were recorded.<br><br>This data was processed and analyzed to find the relationships associated with running pattern and impulse. A comparison of means analysis was used to see if running patterns correlated with different impulses. Then, linear regressions were used to find the relationship between patterns and impulses. Logistic models were also developed to find the relationship between ankle and hip injuries, and patterns and other variables.<br><br>The results, contrary to common belief, show that a forefoot strike pattern yields significantly higher braking and propulsive impulses than a rearfoot strike pattern. Rearfoot runners exhibit significantly less probability of ankle and hip injury than forefoot runners do due to different joints movements, indicating injury may be more complex than simple overall impulses.

ACCESSING REAL WORLD DATA FOR RENDERING
Roberto G. Dailey
The Woodlands College Park High School, The Woodlands, TX

This project has been aimed at creating a device that can provide a comprehensive analysis of light interactions with different materials. Initially, the purpose of the project was to measure light interactions with materials to create more realistic virtual materials in computer generated scenes however, the project evolved into the creation and testing of a device that could identify and quantify light interactions with various materials.<br><br>The device was created with a light emitter and sensor mounted on tracks so that their angle to the surface normal of the tested material can be adjusted. This allows for global mapping of light intensity of light reflecting off the tested material. The sensor can also be moved across the track underneath the surface of the material, allowing for the measurement of transmittance, refraction, and scattering through the material.<br><br>The device was tested with water as a control material; this allowed accepted qualities of the water to be compared with the experimental tests performed by the device in order to evaluate its accuracy. In all tests the device performed accurately, producing repeatable results and providing values that were within one percent of accepted values.<br><br>The device is not limited to its primary application: providing accurate data for the creation of realistically behaving virtual materials in computer generated scenes; it can also be utilized to compare the optical qualities of materials with known values. Because the device examines many different optical qualities, it may aid in the accurate identification of unknown materials.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION SENSOR
Harshit Singh
InTech Collegiate High School, North Logan, UT

Every year, over 2000 children are struck by vehicles in their own driveways, by their family or friends. While current solutions include cameras and sonar technology, they are expensive and are not effective. A new, cheaper, more effective solution is needed. This project investigates the feasibility of using the principles of mutual inductance to create a sensor able to sense objects and people nearby. After experimenting to determine the optimal testing conditions, a steel block was used to change the pickup voltage in the secondary coil. With the steel block, the farthest distance at which a considerable change was detected was about 30-40 centimetres. When a human was near the coil, it also resulted in a change in pickup voltage, but that was at a maximum of 15 centimetres. Although this sensor did not function properly in these testing conditions, it may still work. While testing for optimal conditions, a clear trend was seen between frequency and change in pickup voltage. As the frequency increases, so does the change in pickup voltage. The means to use a higher frequency were not attainable, however, it is possible that at higher frequencies, such as microwaves, an induction sensor may be effective. Furthermore, wet soil caused significant change as well, leading to the conclusion that this sensor can be used in the agricultural field to detect moisture levels in soil.

PERISTALTIC PUMPING OF A MULTI-PHASE FLUID AND IMMERSED SOLID PARTICLES SYSTEM
Varun Bansal
West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this study was to simulate the peristaltic pumping of mixtures of two viscous fluids of different viscosities, both with and without immersed solid particles. The system was computationally modeled using the C programming language. Then, the system was visualized using computer software and quantitative calculations were performed. As a result, the volume fractions, velocities, and general flow patterns of the two fluids could be studied. In both simulations (without and with immersed particles), the volume fraction values varied within the system through time, but followed a repeating pattern. Phase separation occurred due to the volume fraction inhomogenities throughout the system. Overall, both fluids were pumped to the right, in the same direction as the propagating peristaltic wave traveling through the system. The more viscous fluid (F1) was found to have much smaller overall velocity and vortical motion than the less viscous fluid (F2) because of F1’s greater viscosity, as expected. In the simulation with immersed particles, F1 was observed to have a low volume fraction to the left of the particle and a relatively high volume fraction to the right of the particle. Potential applications of this research include the development of replacement body fluids and more effective medical treatments.

MARIMBA A LA MODE
Sara Elise Dibrell
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

Marimbas are instruments with wooden bars that vibrate as standing waves when struck. As mallet choice and strike location change a bar’s timbre, this project examined the effects of these variables on marimba bars’ transverse vibrational modes.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the fundamental mode of vibration would have the highest intensity, that all auxiliary modes would have equal relative intensities in the edge and off center positions, and that the third harmonic would have the greatest relative intensity in the center position. A light mallet would produce the highest intensities, and these results would not vary between octaves of notes.<br><br> A device was constructed from a lumber frame and solenoid rotating mechanism to ensure consistency. A light and hard mallet struck bars C and F from octave 2 to 5 on the edge, center, and 1/12 of the bar’s length off center for two trials. The digital recordings were analyzed with the Fast Fourier Transform to find the relative intensities of the auxiliary modes.<br><br> Except for bars F4 and C5, the fundamental had the greatest intensity. The hard mallet produced the greatest relative intensities. The auxiliary modes never had equal relative intensities because they decreased as the octave of the bars increased.<br><br> It was concluded that the light mallet did not affect the auxiliary modes, whereas with the hard mallet, the second harmonic was of the greatest importance to the bar’s timbre in the off center and edge positions, and the third harmonic was relatively significant in the center position.<br><br>

DISTRIBUTION OF SUPERNOVAE IN THEIR HOST GALAXIES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR PROGENITORS
Hanna Sai
Beijing No.8 Middle School, Beijing, CHINA

We present the studies of position distribution of supernovae(SN) of different types in their host galaxies as well as its correlation with the HII regions with different SN sample collected from the literature. In our analysis, we find that the core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) correlate with the HII regions, with the SNe Ibc subclass showing higher central concentration and tighter correlation with the HII regions than the SN II subclass. This is consistent with previous result that SNe Ibc are associated with large star-forming regions and have young, more massive progenitor stars. However, it is interesting to point out that the thermonuclear SNe (which are dubbed as SNe Ia and are generally thought to arise from accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs) also show some correlations with the HII regions and have a relatively higher central concentration. This indicates that at least a portion of SNe Ia may be actually associated with the star-forming regions and may have relatively young progenitor populations, consistent with the observed bimodal distributions of the SN Ia rate.

THE EFFECT OF MOLAR MASS OF A GAS ON THE SPEED OF A SOUND WAVE
Graham Lewis Gabrielson
Saint Paul Harding Senior High School, Saint Paul, MN

The aim of the experiment is to determine the effects of molar mass of a gas on the speed a wave of sound as it passes through it.<br><br>To answer the question I used a vacuum tube apparatus in in order to keep variables constant. Using the vacuum apparatus I used a microphone and a sound pulse, the microphone would sense the first sound pulse, then the reflected sound pulse. Using the time between sound pulses and the formula c= λf. In order to analyze the data collected, I used an Excel spreadsheet in order to represent data graphically and create trend lines. The general trend in data showed that as molar mass of a gas increased the speed at which a sound wave traveled decreased. Errors included purity of gases chemically made, as well as superimposition due to the length of the incident wave. Further experimentation hopes to focus on the effects of monatomic, diatomic, and polyatomic gases, as well as non-ideal gases.

USING HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY FOR MEASURING MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH
Ethan Michael Salisbury
Centerville High School, Centerville, OH

Holographic interferometry is a metrology technique that can be used to measure extremely small amounts of object displacement. My project examines whether or not it is possible to accurately measure the strength of a magnetic field using this technique. I hypothesized that it is possible to measure the strength of a magnetic field by taking a hologram of a steel plate. Real time holographic interferometry can then be used to measure the displacement caused by placing a 1/2"x1/2"x1/2" rare earth magnet near the steel plate. Through my experimentation, I have determined that it is possible to use holographic interferometry to measure the strength of a magnetic field. Using this technique, I was able to measure displacements on the order of micrometers (1e-6 meters) by using a translation stage to change the distance between the magnet and the steel plate. The fringe pattern at each different spacing was recorded, and used to calculate the deflection of the steel plate due to the magnetic field. This successful mapping of the magnetic field strength proved my hypothesis valid. When comparing the measured magnetic field strength to the known strength of the rare earth magnet, my results were off by a factor of three: 18 micrometers measured displacement versus 6 micrometers theoretical displacement at the strongest point measured. This is likely due to the stability and beam quality of the inexpensive 670 nanometer laser diode used, which effectively created noise in the measurement.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LONG LIFE SOLID STATE DYE LASER
Joseph Patrick Lee
Saint Peter's Academy, New Market, AL

Dye lasers are versatile tools with many applications. Most dye lasers employ a liquid active region, but cost is high and handling is difficult. Solid state dye lasers are cheaper and handling is very simple, however, they have a very limited lifetime. If the lifetime could be increased, then solid state dye lasers would become a practical alternative.<br><br>The primary goal for this project was to design a novel, long life, rotating rod solid state dye laser. It was hypothesized that by rotating the dye rod, the entire rod would have to degrade before performance would suffer. Also, since the active length would be longer, the energy density could be lower in the pumped region, probably resulting in increased lifetime. Another possible advantage was that by this rotation, triplet quenching would likely be greatly reduced, allowing much higher pulse repetition rates and possibly even continuous wave operation.<br><br>Lifetime, pulse width, and relative energy output were measured on liquid, non-rotating solid, and rotating rod solid dye lasers. The pulse widths of all three lasers were essentially the same. Pulse energy of both solid state dye lasers however, were slightly lower than the liquid dye laser. Lifetime of the rotating rod solid dye laser, however, increased very dramatically as hypothesized.<br><br>In conclusion, rotating rod solid state dye lasers do offer a practical solution to the problem of lifetime. The lower energy output is likely caused by impurities in the resins and could be improved by the use of higher quality materials.

TO SQUAT OR NOT TO SQUAT?
Amy Elizabeth Santos
Taunton High School, Taunton, MA

The proper functioning of the knee is dependent upon a joint mechanism that can provide stability, bear heavy weight loads, and move fluidly. Women tend to have anatomical differences that make them more prone to knee injury. One of these differences is the width of the quadriceps angle (Q-angle), a measurement from the knee to the hip, which widens as a woman’s pelvis width increases. This experiment was designed to measure the tension placed on the quadricep and patellar tendons during a deep knee squat and to determine if Q-angle affects the tension. It was hypothesized that if the measure of the knee angle decreases, then tension on the patellar tendon will increase, regardless of the Q-angle. A model knee was bent at specific decreasing angles and the tension was adjusted on a “quadriceps” spring and "tendon" string until equilibrium could support the bent leg. Length changes in the spring were taken and used in a Hooke’s Law analysis to determine the tension. Results showed a non-linear increase in the tension as the flexion angle became more acute, with maximum tension occurring at 45 degrees. The wider (female) Q-angle produced 0.71 lbf and 0.093 lbf less tension at 140 degrees and 120 degrees, respectively. Conversely, at acute angles of 45 degrees and 30 degrees, 0.725 lbf and 0.797 lbf more tension was produced. The Q-angle’s effect on the tension disproved the hypothesis and suggests that a female knee is subject to greater tension changes during a deep knee squat.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY ENHANCED BY CHEMICAL DISORDER IN BIS2-BASED OXIDES
Coco Ying

Exotic non-BCS type superconductors are often seen in quasi-two-dimensional materials. Recently, superconductivity with superconducting transition temperature TC reaches 4.4 K has been reported in a newly synthesized BiS2-based Bi4O4S3 [1,2]. It is known that chemical deficiency can severely affect the superconducting properties. There are several methods that can be used for fabricating ceramic materials.<br><br>In this project, I studied the superconducting properties of Bi4O4S3 and LaOBiS2 that are synthesized using the three methods and two cooling processes. Each of the high-pressure synthesis, solid-state reaction and reactions under autogenic pressure at elevated temperature (RAPET) method can provide a unique chemical environment for crystallization. Slow cooling in room temperature allows the atoms to crystalize in the designed structure, while rapid quenching in liquid nitrogen can provide severe chemical disorder. Results show that superconductivity could be enhanced by chemical disorder through rapid quenching. The TC of Bi4O4S3 synthesized in RAPET is found to be 12% higher than that synthesized in solid-state reaction method. Chemical disorder resulted from rapid quenching given rise to another 5% increase in TC. Surprisingly, superconductivity does appear in the LaOBiS2 synthesized using RAPET method, with TC reaches 4.47 K. However, superconductivity in the LaOBiS2 synthesized using the other two methods does not revealed with cooling to 1.8 K.

THE ABILITY OF MAGNETOTACTIC BACTERIA TO CREATE AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FARADAY’S LAW
Mason Paul Rubin
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which species of Magnetotactic bacteria produce the most electromotive force (emf), and to determine their consistency with Faraday’s Law in an attempt to find an alternate energy source to batteries. Two species of Magnetotactic bacteria from the same genus were cultured and allowed to grow in identical conditions. They were then placed in a container between two electrodes in an attempt to create an electromotive force as a result of their magnetic flux. A Vernier LabQuest was used to measure the voltage of the system every 10-30 seconds indefinitely. The voltage produced by each species was then compared to the other species, as well as to a system that contained only the bacterial medium, and to the voltage produced by Geobacter sulfurreducens- a bacterium known to produce current. Both species of Magnetotactic bacteria produced significantly more emf than the medium alone (p approximately equal to 0 for both bacteria). Furthermore, the species M. magnetotacticum produced significantly more voltage than M. magneticum (p approximately equal to 0). Both systems showed partial evidence of electromagnetic induction.

EFFECT OF WING ASPECT RATIO ON UNDERWATER GLIDER FLIGHT
James Vincent Roggeveen
Nantucket High School, Nantucket, MA

<br><br> Underwater gliders provide a new platform for oceanographic research more cost efficient and time efficient than current methods. They rely on buoyancy engines to create vertical motion and use wings to convert that to horizontal motion. Gliders operating in coastal environments, such as the SLOCUM glider, face the danger of entanglement which limits their operational range. Reducing aspect ratio with swept wings was hypothesized to reduce the danger of entanglement but also decrease flight performance.<br><br> A glider based on the SLOCUM glider was used in conjunction with four wing designs of varying aspect ratios from 4.5 to 1, corresponding to wing sweeps of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 60°. The glider was tested in a tank with and without initial velocity. A three-axis accelerometer and a pressure transducer provided flight data, which could be used to determine horizontal distance as well as horizontal and vertical speed using vector analysis. <br><br> The testing found a slight difference in the flight performance of the different aspect ratios. A change in average glide slope was observed, between 1.54 and 2.18, which was statistically significant, with a P-value of 0.049; a significant change also was observed in the average vertical velocity and horizontal velocity, suggesting a higher velocity and improved slope for the lower aspect ratio wings.<br><br> The data rejects the hypothesis, indicating that lower aspect ratios improve glider performance, possibly leading to gliders with a reduced chance of entanglement. These findings are consistent with Reynolds number predictions for gliders in this scale regime. <br><br>

FOCUSING SOUND WAVES USING A TWO-DIMENSIONAL NON-LINEAR SYSTEM, PHASE II
Thorsen Michael Wehr
Cedarcrest High School, Duvall, WA

Sound is logarithmic by nature; if the distance a person hears a point sound doubles, the amplitude halves. In dry air, waves travel l8x slower than in more dense materials, such as steel. Focusing sound, or the acoustic lens effect, was governed by this principle. A device for redirecting longitudinal waves was engineered and assembled. The device consisted of a non-linear acoustic lens, and release system, and a microphone recording system, for data collection. During Experimental in both Center trials and Right-side trials, a non-linear acoustic lens had a force applied to each chain depending on the chain number from the desired focal point. Center trials were focusing the sound waves to the center of the lens while Right-side trials were focusing to the right side of the lens. Data was recorded using microphones and analyzed using Sigview sound analysis software. During Center trials and Right-side trials, the average relative amplitude of the Control data compared to the Experimental data at the projected focal points were analyzed using a two-tailed t-test and were both found to be statistically different. This research was considered a success because the non-linear acoustic lens produced a noticeable increase in relative amplitude at a specific focal point in both Center and Right-side trials.

Discovered in 1932, few studies have been conducted to detect the spatial distribution of scattered light reflected from the surface of antibubbles or the thickness of the air layer determined from interference patterns within. The original purpose of this experiment was to determine how antibubbles are produced and to then learn about their characteristics. After antibubbles could be made on command, the thickness and the emission spectrum of the air layer became items of experimentation.<br><br> To obtain the thickness and emission spectrum, long-lasting antibubbles encapsulated with vegetable oil were produced. Interference patterns within the air layer, or outer layer, were then observed from spectragraphs produced by an OceanOptics spectrometer and video recorded with a web-camera.<br><br> Encapsulated antibubbles were found to have peak absorptions at 450 nm and 650 nm. Additionally, the northern poles of antibubbles would thicken as the southern poles thinned. The experiment also demonstrated how an antibubble could be used to transport materials. Microbubbles were videoed as they formed in the antibubbles and were transferred from the top to the bottom of the container.<br><br> Antibubbles could serve as drug delivery systems if the air layer was replaced with a photopolymer and hardened with UV light, while encapsulating a drug. Over time the drug would be released. Antibubbles could also be used in the moving, storing, and/or mixing of droplets in food preparation. The future of antibubbles is just a pop away.

CLOSE COMPANIONS TO KEPLER OBJECTS OF INTEREST: RESULTS FROM A LARGE ADAPTIVE OPTICS SURVEY
Ganesh Ravichandran
Walter Tresper Clarke High School, Westbury, NY

NASA's Kepler mission has been highly successful in detecting thousands of exoplanetary candidates in the Milky Way galaxy. However, the existence of astrophysical false positives has substantially impeded the candidate validation process. In this study, adaptive optics (AO) images of 931 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) have been analyzed in support of False Positive Probability (FPP) calculations for Kepler planetary candidates. In order to manually compile star catalogs for these AO images, an easy-to-use and efficient Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed using the Python programming language. The first compiled catalog contained previously unknown KOI pixel coordinates, while the second catalog additionally included pixel and sky coordinates for all stars within 4 arcseconds of their respective KOIs. Moreover, 45 KOIs were identified as having previously unknown close companions (stars within 2 arcseconds of the KOI). These companions often "blend" the light from their KOIs, resulting in improper calculations of the planet-to-star radius ratio. Thus, by measuring the fluxes of close companions relative to their respective KOIs, I have calculated true implied radius ratios (IRR) of planetary candidates for various transit scenarios. Furthermore, multiple planetary candidates were vetted based on these recalculated IRR values, and preliminary inferences of false positivity were made. The two star catalogs compiled using the GUI will support future FPP analyses of potentially hundreds of Kepler planetary candidates and significantly extend the understanding of exoplanets in our galaxy. Furthermore, the GUI designed here may be implemented as an interactive tool for teaching students about exoplanetary astronomy.

SOLAR TSUNAMI: A STUDY OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS AND EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET WAVES
Kayla Lokelani Ishida
Waimea High School, Waimea, HI

This project focuses on determining whether increased CME linear speeds will affect the generation of an EUV wave. It was hypothesized that CME’s with a linear speed above 489km/s will produce an EUV wave. The linear speed of 489 km/s was selected because it is the average speed of coronal mass ejections. The null hypothesis considered for statistical analysis is that the distributions of all the CMEs are the same as the distribution of CMEs that produced EUV waves. CME and EUV data was obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory which takes images of the solar atmosphere at different wavelengths. Using JHelioviewer I viewed compiled pictures taken of the sun over one minute time periods. I found that my hypothesis was not supported. The data showed that out of the 319 CME events with a linear speed above 489km/s, only 19 or 5.96% of these CMEs produced an EUV wave. I also found that two CME events with linear speeds of 260 and 360 km/s produced EUV waves. The weighted chi squared value calculated for this project is 291.74. Since the weighted chi square value is large the null hypothesis is rejected and the two data sets, the total CMEs and CMEs with EUV waves, are not the same distributions. Thus, the chi squared test has indicated that CMEs that generate EUV waves are a special subset of all CMEs with linear speeds that are different from the average population. To investigate whether the 21 CMEs that produced EUV waves are statistically different from the general population of CMEs, Gaussian statistics were applied. I found that the linear velocity of CMEs with EUV waves is 16 standard deviations (sigma) above the average linear velocity of CMEs in general. This test shows that CMEs with EUV waves are statistically different from the general population of CMEs.

SUNSPOTS: SOLAR FLARE PREDICTION THROUGH UTILIZATION OF THE MAUNDER BUTTERFLY PATTERN
Kelly Eilish Schmidt
Elko High School, Elko, NV

The goal of my project was to design a more accurate method of predicting future solar activity, primarily solar flares and solar cycles. I designed my method based on a reoccurring solar pattern referred to as the Maunder “Butterfly” Pattern. This pattern relates to the observable “blemishes” on the sun, called sunspots, which over time move toward the sun’s equator between certain specific latitudes. Existing methods of solar flare prediction are inaccurate at best and unanticipated flares threaten to cause massive destruction to Earth’s communication systems and technologies. I hypothesized that the opportunity to forecast solar events was inherent in the Butterfly Pattern, based on its relation of current and historic observable sunspots.<br><br>In order to test my hypothesis about the possible utilization of the Butterfly Pattern, I observed and recorded the latitudinal location and magnitude of sunspots through a telescope for several months. Overall, I found that spots were occurring at average latitudes of ±22.83°. I then compared my data to historical records of sunspot appearance and searched for parallels between current and past activity. There were several instances of correspondence between my observations and those of the past. In particular, the present cycle of solar activity showed a large degree of commonality with Solar Cycle 15, which occurred in the early 1900’s. Due to the correlation between these two cycles, I was able to assume that they would share certain qualities, enabling me to make a prediction of the intensity and duration of our current solar cycle.

NEW METHOD TO MEASURE SPHERE ROLLING FRICTION COEFFICIENT
Hyeonsu Kim
Chungnam Science High School, Gong-ju, SOUTH KOREA

The error in the existing method for measuring the rolling friction coefficient of a rolling object is recognized. Then, I tried to suggest a new method. The error of the old method is a sliding. I focused on the slope of the experiment of the old method, and I realized that the friction coefficient have to be measured on a horizontal plane. Also, For improving the instability of the horizontal plane, the experiment was made in a Schale shape.<br><br> After recording the ball rolling in edge of a circular plane, analyzing the movement to find the section rolling unadulteratedly, we can measure the rolling friction coefficient by a differential equation. The actual measurement results are small and the deviation is also very small.<br><br> This time, for checking that the ball really rolls genuinely, I compared a actual linear-graph and the linear-graph of rolling genuinely. Then, those drawn almost same graph. Also, for confirming that the new method is agree with the fact : rolling friction coefficient is in inverse proportion to the radius of the sphere, I measured the coefficient of three different iron balls. Then, I could obtain the inverse graph.<br><br> In conclusion, the suggested method is the most stable, efficient and accurate. This measurement method can be applied to measure the rolling friction coefficient of a bearing spun in place accurately. Of course, this is not the only.

A NOVEL PULSED LED EXCITATION DEVICE FOR OPTICAL MAPPING OF TRANSMEMBRANE POTENTIAL IN CARDIAC MUSCLE
Lakshmi Raghavanpillai Raju
Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

Purpose: The purpose of the project was to develop a pulsed LED excitation device with a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB), for light dispersion in optical mapping of transmembrane potential in cardiac muscle perfused with voltage sensitive fluorescent dye. Advances in optics have enabled the use of fluorescent dyes coupled with high speed photodetectors in optical mapping. Measurement artifacts are reduced by employing ratiometric measurements. Ratiometry in optical mapping involves collection of two fluorescent signals that exhibit changes in fluorescence with respect to the experimental parameter and deducing the ratio of the two. However, it is essential that the light emitted due to each of the two excitations have identical distribution on the tissues. <br><br>Procedure: The PCB was designed using Eagle program and LEDs were mounted on the PCB by a method developed in the laboratory. The light dispersion due to the color mixing device was compared to a previously made fiber optics technique. The tests were performed by shining the light sources on to an opaque surface and capturing the image by a digital camera. <br><br>Data analysis: A MATLAB program was written with a graphical user interface. The images were analyzed using this program. Two and three-dimensional intensity contour plots were graphed and compared.<br><br>Conclusion: A novel pulsed LED excitation device was created and compared with an existing device. The new device produced uniform and reproducible contours on an opaque surface. When compared to the fiber optic system, the new apparatus demonstrated a more uniform and concentric light distribution profile.

HELICOTOROIDAL TOPOLOGY OF LEPTONS, QUARKS, AND HADRONS
Viola Mocz
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

The internal structure of elementary particles is not yet fully understood. I introduce a semi-classical wave-particle model of leptons, quarks, and hadrons in which the particle is confined in periodic boundary conditions of one Compton wavelength. The wave propagates on closed toroidal paths (streamlines of internal energy flow) in locally curved 3-D space. In analogy with a moving relativistic Dirac electron, the wave may also be viewed as a series of helical tubular surfaces the trajectory of which is the torus of the proposed model. The size of the helicotoroid scales with the total energy contained in the particle field and the model has harmonic oscillator dynamics. The topology and internal path of the particle depend on the number of radial oscillations through the torus hole (M) and azimuthal revolutions around the torus (N). Each path is specified by an (M,N)-torus knot which is also associated with the spin, path angular momentum, and Zitterbewegung (trembling motion) of the particle. The spin and the computed energy flow suggest that leptons may be described by (1,2)-double looped unknots where the loops lie on top of one another. Further, pseudoscalar mesons may be described by (1,1) circular loops, vector mesons by (2,1) figure-eight unknots, and baryons by (3,2)-trefoil knots. Quarks are not sufficient in themselves to complete a closed loop, but when combined they can form the closed loops of hadrons. Such conceptualization may allow us to describe some fundamental properties of distinct particle families within a single framework.

LASER-INDUCED PROPULSION OF ANTICANCER-DOXORUBICIN USING LOW-POWER LASER OPTICAL TWEEZING
Rebecca Michelle Murray
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

The laser induced movement of molecules across a liquid-liquid interface has significant potential in changing the way medications are introduced to cells, as it causes minimal damage to the surrounding cells and doesn’t require mechanical intervention. Previous methods of laser transport have required high-powered lasers and relatively durable drug molecules for transportation. This research investigates induced movement of a chemotherapy drug through the use of optical tweezers, which is created by focusing the beam of a laser to a point that can be used to trap particles. This effect can be used to move complex drug molecules across an interface without harming the molecules, and only utilizes an 8 mW He-Ne laser. Experimentation involved successfully transporting particles of the cancer drug Doxorubicin across a membrane between two immiscible liquids, from a liquid in which it is not soluble (water) into a liquid in which it is soluble (chloroform). Transportation was achieved using a simplified optical tweezers configuration, including a lower-powered laser relative to traditional setups. In 250 µl of water, 73 ng of solid Doxorubicin were transported into 550 µl of a neighboring chloroform layer, corresponding to the transport of 7.3x10^16 molecules with a single illumination. Movement and subsequent presence of the Doxorubicin in the chloroform layer was confirmed using the drug’s natural fluorescent properties, with detection based on 550 and 590 nm emissions with an excitation wavelength of 230 nm. Practical application would use this method to transport miniscule amounts of drug molecules across a cell membrane.

METHOD FOR MASS ESTIMATION OF THE HIGGS PARTICLE IN THE DECAY HIGGS->TAU TAU
Noam Ottolenghi
Yachad Modi'in High School, Modi'in, ISRAEL

Purpose and Introduction:<br><br>One of the most important missions in physics today is to characterize the Higgs Boson, which its existence has been proved lately. In order to characterize the Higgs, we need to measure its decay rate to fermions. In this project we focused on the Higgs decay to two tau particles, which also decay quickly to a lepton and two neutrinos each. The main difficulty in this decay is that there are neutrinos in it which cannot be detected.<br><br>Procedures:<br><br>In this project, we developed an estimator that estimates the original particle's mass from the products of the decay. Our goal is to create a more accurate estimator than the present estimators. The mass estimation is made by finding the maximum of a likelihood function of the original particle's mass for the given decay products. After developing that function, I developed an algorithm based on the Gradient descend method that finds the function's maximum.<br><br>Tests:<br><br>We tested the model on a collection of simulated event decays Higgs boson and Z boson, which decays in a similar way, and can be easily found. The estimator showed their mass accurately.<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>We found that our estimator performs better than the traditional collinear mass estimator, but it is more complicated and thus it takes more time to calculate it.

The purpose of this project is to optimize and accelerate the sedimentoscopy process by using the shadow analysis method. <br><br>The idea of this project is to get a working sedimentoscope using only shaded light, as opposed to existing models based on measuring diffused light. Our proposed original device will be the size of a pen.<br><br>Photovoltaic modules from Plexiglas were constructed for use in this device. Using two-channel mode I calculated the average size of particles using Stokes’ Law formula. <br><br>When compared with the real size and with result get on industrial sedimentoscope where observational error was less than 2%. When I tried to get variation of size processing experimental data using trivial formulas I found that error was over 30%. To reach necessary dependability, an original computer program was developed. After processing the “ideal” simulated data, a formula that describes dependence of light intensity from particle size distribution was found. Using it to process the experimental data, valid results were obtained with observational error of 3.4%. <br><br>This method can be used for express quality analysis of paint products or fat content of milk; control of water turbidity & pollution etc. Besides its mobility and ease-to-use allows using it everywhere from large industries to labs. Using the Lennard-Jones potential in computer program gives us possibility to simulate partially ordered systems.

ANALYSIS OF JOVIAN DECAMETRIC EMISSION USING THE LONG WAVELENGTH ARRAY STATION 1
Jinhie Lee Skarda
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD

The shielding presence of planetary magnetospheres appears to be crucial for the development of complex life, making the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets especially interesting. The structure and polarization properties of radio-frequency emission generated within Jupiter’s magnetosphere, Jovian decametric emission (DAM), were analyzed using data from a recently completed high-resolution radio telescope, the Long Wavelength Array Station 1 (LWA1). Bandpassing and clipping methods were developed to remove noise from the data. Stokes I and Stokes V were calculated to study the circular polarization of the emissions. Five terabytes of data were analyzed to yield the first Jovian DAM results from the LWA1, which were compared with published results in the literature from other instruments. The structure of the emissions, S-burst frequency drift rates, and estimate of the Io-B emission total flux, compared well with previous studies. The fine structure study revealed intriguing observations of apparent destructive interferences between S- and N-bursts, the rarely seen wide-band Io-C modulation lanes, and Io-C emissions with right- and left-hand circular polarizations that could have originated from the same source rather than from opposite hemispheres. Comparing the fractional circular polarizations of the emissions to Jupiter’s elevation angle revealed evidence of leakage of Stokes I into Stokes V. Through preliminary characterization of the array’s response to elliptically polarized emission and new observations of fine structures in the emissions, this analysis sets the ground work for using the LWA1 to develop better emission models for Jovian DAM and eventually to probe the magnetospheres of extrasolar planets.

THE MANIPULATION OF MICRO-FLUIDIC PROPERTIES FOR BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS
Vipul Anjan Nandigala
Walled Lake Western High School, Walled Lake, MI

The goal of this project was to isolate particles in a microfluidic systems for use in applications such as drug-delivery and biological assays. Although it is simple to isolate particles at a macro-scale by using a magnet with magnetic particles or even a centrifuge, complications occur when trying to do the same at a micro-level due to the counter-intuitive properties of fluids at <500 micrometers (microns). And so I engineered a solution by manipulating the micro-fluidic properties. In this experiment, I dealt with two fluids, water with the particles that I was trying to concentrate and separate from the water, and oleic acid (a type of oil). The first step was forcing each fluid through its own microfluidic channel with cross-sectional dimensions of 100 microns by 150 microns and have these channels, one containing the water with particles and the other containing oil, meet at a T-junction. Interestingly, when the two immiscible fluids met, the original stream of water would turn into a stream of droplets of water separated by oil. The droplet would have unique flow patterns such as vortex flow and so I manipulated these such that the particles in the droplet of water would all aggregate in the bottom back corner of the droplet. After developing this method of concentrating the particles within the droplet I used a four way junction with oil coming from the vertical channels squeezing the water coming from the horizontal channel. By manipulating another micro-fluidic property, namely interfacial tension, I was able to spilt the original droplet with the particles concentrated in the back, into two droplets one with pure water and one with all of my particles.This method could be used in drug deliveries and biological assays due to its effectiveness and quickness.

PHOTOMETRIC EVIDENCE OF CHANGES IN PULSATION CHARACTERISTICS OF HOT SUBDWARF B STARS
Arjun Raghavan
Chapel Hill High School, Chapel Hill, NC

Rapidly pulsating subdwarf B stars (sdBVR stars) are the fastest pulsating star class in the Universe, exhibiting pulsations in light energy ranging from 80 to 600 seconds. These rare stars are especially important because the multiple pulsation frequencies found in them provide astronomers with the remarkable opportunity to research the internal structures of stars through astero-seismology. Until now, only about 70 sdBVR’s have been identified and a very small percentage of these have ever been re-observed after their discoveries to look for any differences in their pulsation characteristics.<br><br> <br><br>This study thoroughly examines changes in the pulsation characteristics of 8 of the 70 sdBVR stars. Thousands of images were processed, Fourier transforms of light curves were calculated, and multiple noise-accounting procedures were undertaken, giving emphasis to accuracy, considering the dearth of information about these stars. After analysis, four main breakthroughs were identified. Observational evidence substantiated the theory that amplitude changes occur in most sdBVR’s, with 6 out of the 8 stars showing amplitude changes with time. The fastest ever published change in pulsation amplitude was found in star PG1605+072, a 75% variation per day, 3 times the previous fastest rate. An sdBVR was shown to have non-beating related amplitude change. Lastly, a current compilation of changes on a variety of timescales, essential for further research, was documented in this study. Information about these variations gives a groundbreaking insight that evolution on the insides of stars may be occurring at a drastically faster rate than the evolution that is visible externally.

IMPROVING A BASIC PROCEDURE TO COMPARE MUSIC USING FFTS
Noah Davisson Kihata
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

Last year, a basic procedure was found to compare music. When music is broken down into its individual signals, it can be compared using a Fast Fourier Transform. Using Audacity, data points can then be exported and compared using the angle between two vectors formula. This project delves deeper into this procedure by examining and improving it.<br><br> To accomplish this, songs were purchased from eight different groups, each containing solo instruments. These songs were imported into Audacity, and a thirty-second sample of music was taken. After being compared in homemade workbooks, the workbooks returned data points, along with averages. The data from these workbooks was then condensed in a different workbook for easier viewing, and tests such as standard deviation and average were preformed.<br><br> A standard deviation of 5.72471 x 10--4 was found when the averages of main groups were found. With this, it can be said that the value around which music can be compared is 2.852147 x 10-3. This is found when taking a ten second clip of only audible frequencies of songs. It was also found that using slope to compare music did not return statistically similar results, but more research is needed in this area. An application of this project was also completed. It brought the streamlined process into a small market for realistic use. The returned data showed that out of six songs, participants will judge their favorite selection to be in the top three most similar songs 60% of the time.

THE SYNTHESIS OF LESS EXPENSIVE, LESS TOXIC COLOR-EMITTING QUANTUM DOTS
Marina Ali
Saint Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

Quantum dots are an exciting path in the field of nanotechnology; their potential use appears endless and one such way they can be used is in displays for various electronics. Most people are familiar with liquid crystal displays (or LCD’s), but not many aware of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (or QD-LED’s) and their benefits. QD-LEDS offer a wide color range, are true to colors that humans naturally perceive, are brighter than regular LCD’s, have low power consumption, and have larger life spans than organic light-emitting diodes (or OLED’s). Though they bring much to the table of electronic displays, one of the biggest problems facing QD-LED’s is that they are toxic and expensive to make. I take on this problem by trying to synthesize a quantum dot made of colloidal gold and silver because they are known to be less toxic and cheaper to produce in large amounts. Quantum dots can be modified to emit different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum by manipulating their cores and shells (ligands). For my experiments, I used chloroauric acid and silver nitrate as a core and dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1-hexanthiol. At the end of my research period, I managed to synthesize a sample of colloidal gold quantum dots that yielded bright red light and a sample of colloidal silver quantum dots that fluoresced faint blue-ultraviolet light.

GEOMETRIC BORE VARIATIONS AND THEIR HARMONIC NUANCES IN MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
Harrison Robert Pershing
Greely High School, Cumberland, ME

All wind instruments, since the oldest known prehistoric flute, have been built with circular cross sections. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of different cross-sectional shapes on the sound of an instrument. The hypothesis was that by changing the cross-section of a wind instrument, the sound of the instrument will change. A circular, triangular, and square instrument were built, and their sound spectra were compared. The dimensions of the instruments were designed to control for apothem and height. The sound spectra produced by the instruments were analyzed in MATLAB. In the higher frequencies, the average amplitudes of the triangular instrument varied significantly from those of the circular instrument (p<0.01). The amplitudes of the square instrument were not significantly different (p>0.01). Instruments with overtone frequencies occurring in multiples of the fundamental have a natural or pleasing sound. An analysis of the intervals between overtone frequencies showed that the average interval for the circular instrument’s spectrum fell in multiples of the fundamental. The square instrument’s frequency interval was significantly different from that of the circular instrument ( p<0.01), but the triangular instrument’s was not (p>0.01). A follow-up experiment used the program Ripple Tank to simulate vibrations within an increased range of polygonal enclosures. The simulations showed that as the number of sides of a wave’s enclosure increase, the waves get more regular. This observation was supported by the spectra of pentagonal and hexagonal instruments.<br><br>

QUBIT ROTATOR: A NANOWIRE DEVICE FOR ROTATION AND READOUT OF FLYING ELECTRON SPIN QUBITS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR QUANTUM COMPUTING
Saumil Bandyopadhyay
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, VA

Quantum computers possess the ability to solve intractable problems, but their implementation is enormously challenging. The ideal host for a qubit in a solid is an electron’s spin. In this research, I show, for the first time, successful initialization, unitary rotation, and readout of flying electron spin qubits at room temperature. Spin-polarized electrons are injected into electrochemically self-assembled 50-nm diameter InSb nanowires of 20-nm length sandwiched between cobalt and nickel spin injectors and detectors. The measured room-temperature longitudinal magnetoresistances of these devices exhibit well-resolved troughs between the coercive fields of cobalt and nickel due to coherent spin injection, transport, and detection. The transverse magnetoresistances show well-resolved Hanle oscillations of period ~400 Oe at room temperature due to coherent spin precession. This is the first time both effects have been observed in the same sample at room temperature, providing an unambiguous demonstration of qubit rotation. From these measurements and transmission electron microscopy, I have also determined the Fermi energy of electrons in the InSb spacer (~5 micro-eV), transit time (~40 psec), electron mobility (~0.0001 m^2/V-sec), and the spin relaxation time (~10 psec). Additionally, I could conclude that ~96% of the electrons reside in the lowest quantized subband of the nanowire. Surprisingly, the spin relaxation time is ten times longer than what has been reported for bulk InSb, despite the much poorer mobility in my samples. This can only be explained by concluding that among the two major spin relaxation mechanisms in semiconductors–D’yakonov-Perel’ and Elliott-Yafet–the former is overwhelmingly dominant.

LET THERE BE LIGHT!... FULLY SOLUTION-PROCESSED POLYMER BASED- ALUMINUM SUBSTRATE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS FABRICATED IN AMBIENT AIR
Faizullah Mashriqi
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

Organic photovoltaic cells (PVCs) were fabricated where every layer was deposited as a solution onto an opaque aluminum substrate. The cells were based on a P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction and a Ag nanowire anode. Unlike conventional PVCs, these cells were fabricated in ambient air, which are closer to operating conditions and would produce a more robust device. The aluminum oxide layer on top of aluminum acts as an insulator because it prohibits electron transfer to the cathode and thus, degrades the PVC's performance. In order to understand aluminum oxide-based degradation, the thickness of the aluminum oxide layer was determined by building a static ellipsometer and analyzing the data with Mueller calculus. This showed an aluminum oxide thickness of 144.70 ± 0.92 nm. To alter the insulating surface of the cathode, titanium oxide nanospheres were embedded in the aluminum. Titanium oxide's electrical properties makes it a candidate for an electron transporting layer. With the titanium oxide, the short circuit current-density demonstrates a 20 fold increase in the dark and a 4 fold increase under illumination. This shows an enhancement of charge transportation and PVC performance. The complete fabrication demonstrated in ambient air and via solution processing techniques points to future PVC roll-to-roll production at the large scale.

THE FIRST VALIDATION OF THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE TIME INTEGRAL OF DISTANCE
Maya Burhanpurkar
Barrie Dist North Collegiate, Barrie, CANADA

The measurement of fundamental aspects of nature, such as the Higgs Boson for example, represents important milestones in science. Similarly, the integral of distance (dubbed “Absement” by S. Mann), is another fundamental aspect of nature which theoretically exists and can be mathematically calculated, but has never been physically measured. Specifically, it has been clearly understood since Newton that the integral of acceleration is velocity and the integral of velocity is distance, yet the integral of distance has remained an elusive concept. <br><br> <br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to detect Absement, for the first time, within a physical system, thus marking a new milestone in fundamental physics.<br><br> <br><br>The methodology involved development of a novel experimental apparatus consisting of a fluid reservoir with a microprocessor-controlled, linear valve whose motion resulted in the precisely controlled release of fluid at continuously varying, preprogrammed rates. A strong linear relationship (R=0.9995) was observed between the a) mathematically calculated integral of the valve’s displacement, and b) experimentally measured volume of fluid released, as functions of time, thus revealing Absement.<br><br> <br><br>In conclusion, detection of the physical existence of Absement marks the first major addition to Newton’s standard model of fundamental kinematics. Practical applications range from fundamental physics to fighter-jet avionics where optimization of flight guidance computer algorithms is crucial to tactical superiority. For example, changes in aircraft elevation, when computed using integrals of nose-to-tail vertical distance, instead of conventional trigonometry, increase the efficiency of the on-board computation of flight dynamics on x86 platforms by 2,000%.

CREATING PEAS: PORTABLE ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM - DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A NOVEL COLD CATHODE SOURCE
Jennifer Ann Csele
Notre Dame College School, Welland, CANADA

In order to detect and quantify the presence of heavy metal contamination in soil and plastics, a novel hollow cathode lamp was constructed where the sample is the cathode. A low-pressure discharge is created using both radio-frequency energy at 27MHz and DC excitation at 1500V to sputter and excite non-conducting samples such as soil and plastics. Light is then emitted at each element’s analytical line (a wavelength that is unique to a particular element) and are used to determine a signal-to-reference (S/R) ratio for each element where the signal is the intensity of the analytical line of the target element, and the reference the intensity of a different and unrelated wavelength. This allows analysis of multiple elements simultaneously. <br><br>To calibrate the system, samples were prepared with known contaminant concentrations. Data was graphed and a logarithmic relationship was determined between the S/R ratio and concentration. The lamp was then incorporated into a complete system where little user interaction is required. A multi-chamber lamp system was engineered which allowed up to four samples to be analyzed in one cycle. A microcontroller, programmed in C, controls gas pressure using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, as well as collects data from the spectrometer, and displays results on an LCD. Soil assays were performed on suspected contaminated sites and comparison was made to available assays. Samples of plastics, included children’s toys, were tested. Some were found to exceed the established safe-level of 90 ppm for lead concentration with one toy reading 1770ppm of lead.

DILUTED MAGNETIC SEMICONDUCTOR (GD DOPED ZNO)
Ahmed Nabil Halawani
Dar Althiker School, Jeddah, SAUDI ARABIA

2001 was the year when the Polish scientist, T. Dietl, proposed doping wide band-gap<br><br>semiconductors with a magnetic materials would generate ferromagnetism. Scientists have started<br><br>to dope semiconductors with magnetic materials to create magnetism and semiconducting combined<br><br>in a single material system, Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors (DMSs). These materials have<br><br>potential applications in Spintronic devices. However, these new materials do not often show<br><br>ferromagnetic properties above room temperature. In this work, Gd 1.0wt% doped with ZnO thin films were prepared by the pulsed laser deposition technique and then characterized via XRD, SEM and SQUID- magnetometer. XRD shows that the best growth of the film is along the c-axis of the hexagonal Wurtzite structure. SEM micrograph shows that these films are polycrystalline with multiple grains. Magnetization loops at 5K and at 300K confirm ferromagnetism in the sample. Gd at 0.04at% and oxygen pressure at 20 mTorr got a tremendous magnetization of 12.35 μB. The origin of ferromagnetism was attributed to oxygen vacancy mediated via formation of polarons. The applications of this research are to decrease the prices of modern technology and to increase its efficiency. Also, altering the spin of the electrons can create data; it can be saved in the spin, even without electricity, and in a very tiny thin film ( >200nm). This project can be used in the medical field, by attaching the material with bacteria that is attracted to cancer cells, cancer can be detected by scanning the body with MRI after injecting the bacteria.

RAPID OPTIMIZATION OF QUANTUM DOT SOLAR CELLS USING A NOVEL RATING SYSTEM INTEGRATING QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODELING AND SOLAR ABSORPTION ALGORITHM
Valerie S Ding
Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR

Photovoltaics are at the forefront of modern-day renewable energy research. An emerging technology, quantum dot (QD) solar cells, is theoretically highly efficient, thus rapidly gaining traction. However, state-of-the-art QD cells still lag behind conventional solar cells – significant research is required.<br><br> This study aims to rapidly improve QD cells with quantum mechanical modeling, and proposes a novel research technique and rating system for optimizing QD solar cells. PbSe QD absorption coefficients for various geometries and sizes were computed using cloud computing. A novel algorithm combining absorption coefficients and solar irradiance on Earth’s surface was developed, considering that QD performance in photovoltaics is largely dependent on total absorption of incident solar photon energy. A Python program was written to implement the algorithm. Total solar absorption and normalized ratings were thus calculated for a variety of PbSe QD configurations.<br><br> Further analysis indicated that QD ratings were highly dependent on shape and size, and that peak performances for various quantum shapes are optimized at certain dimensions: spheroids at 3.6 nm, cuboids at 3 nm, and spheroids at 4 nm. Additionally, individual geometries and dimensions were compared.<br><br> Previously published experimental studies tended to coincide with this model in QD size range, but none demonstrated solid control over QD geometry. Hopefully, this model will play a role in facilitating rapid optimization.<br><br> This study proposes, implements, and demonstrates a novel research methodology and rating system for QDs in photovoltaic applications. This method can be used to optimize QDs for solar cells much more quickly than existing methods.

DISCOVERY OF NEW VARIABLE STAR IN CASSIOPEIA
Ilkham Irekovich Galiullin
Grammar School 139, Kazan, RUSSIA

Variable stars are the most interesting class of space objects. Most of them are at the active stage of evolution and display the influence of the most number of physical laws in different combinations. Due to expansion of CCD photometry methods dynamics of discovering new variable stars has risen sharply at the present time. <br><br> In 2010 I observed several regions of stars in the observatory. 347 images of the V523 Cas star region without any filter were made. The limiting magnitude of the images is 17m and the exposure time is 60 seconds. The accuracy of determining the time of observation exceeds 1 second. The accuracy of determining luminosity is 0.05m. <br><br> I proceeded with search for new variable stars in 2012. To determine the magnitude of stars, I selected two reference stars and one check star; I discovered 3 new variable stars in the V523 Cas star area. They have not been documented in the GCVS and VSX (AAVSO) international variable star catalogues. One of them – the USNO-A2.0 1350-00672920 star was chosen as the object of a detailed study. Based on my observations, I determined the preliminary type of variability (DSCT) and the period of the USNO-A2.0 1350-00672920 star luminosity variation (0.1647 d). BVR observations of the same region from the archive were used to specify the type of variability. <br><br> Based on the most observations in V filter (377, exposure time 5 seconds), I managed to classify USNO-A2.0 1350-00672920 with certainty as a variable of the W Uma type with the period 0.2830d ± 0.0002. The amplitude of variation: primary minimum – 0,37 m (14.25–14.62m V), secondary minimum – (14.25–14.51m V). <br><br> Summing up what has been said, I discovered a new variable star.

MEASUREMENTS OF THE SUN'S ROTATION PERIOD USING SUNSPOTS
Amanda Zoe Mercado
Manuel Ramos Hernandez High School, Quebradillas, PUERTO RICO

The Sun is the closest star to the Earth. One of the physical phenomenons that occur in its atmosphere is the sunspots. The problem that needed to be solved was to know if the sunspots identified as number: 1599, 1612, and 1614, can help to determine the rotation of the Sun. The alternate hypothesis established that the movement of sunspots identified as number: 1599, 1612, and 1614 can help to determine the rotation of the Sun using mathematical calculations. The three identified sunspots were selected from “spaceweather.com”. Sunspot 1614 was located at the north of the sun’s equator, sunspot 1612 was at the center of the sun's equator, and sunspot 1599 was located at the south of the sun’s equator. These were observed from October 25 to November 18, 2012. The daily movement of the spots was used to calculate the Sun's rotation. Sunspots measurements, such as, angular displacement, latitude and radius were done by analyzing photos of them as they moved from west to east. The rotation calculated for these locations was: 29.05 days at the north, 14.02 days at the south, and 30.39 days at the center. The results obtained for each sunspot differed from one location to the other, but the average rotation was 24.48 days which is very close to the known value of 25 days. It was concluded that sunspots can help to determine the Sun’s rotation using mathematical calculations. The time differences between the three spots, suggest that the Sun has a differential rotation.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION EMITTED BY DIFFERENT CELL PHONE MODELS
Bradlee David Velez
Escuela Intermedia Nueva, Ceiba, PUERTO RICO

A lot is being said about the negative consequences of the electromagnetic radiation absorption emitted by cell phones to humans, but do all cell phones emit the same amount of electromagnetic radiation? The hypothesis established that not all cell phones emitted the same amount of electromagnetic radiation; therefore some cell phones are more dangerous than others. This project looked over different models of cell phones to find out how much electromagnetic radiation they emitted. To those purposes an Electromagnetic Radiation Detector DT-1130 was used to take the measurements. Each cell phone’s electromagnetic radiation was measured first without being charged and the results were recorded. Then the process was repeated, but at this time the cell phones were plugged to an electrical outlet, to charge them. The experimental results supported the hypothesis, not all cell phones emitted the same amount of electromagnetic radiation, plus it was evidenced that it is way more dangerous to use the cell phone while it is charging.

COSMIC RAY MUONS: ZENITH ANGLE RELATED FLUX INTENSITY EQUATION AND ENERGY RADIATION COMPARISON
Joel Eduardo Fuentes
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Cosmic ray muons (µ^-) and antimuons (µ^+) are subatomic particles created during weak interaction between highly energetic cosmic rays, also referred to as energy radiation that strikes Earth from space. The intensity of cosmic radiation is proportional to the increase in altitude, and it consists mostly of charged particles that are affected by Earth’s magnetic field. Muons reach the surface of the Earth with typically constant flux. The hypothesis of this research established that there is a relationship between cosmic ray flux intensity and latitude and longitude. The equation that represents the intensity of penetrating particles at sea level as a function of the zenith angle was used to estimate the expected counting rates of the detectors due to the total flux of penetrating particles. The sets of data used for the experiment were collected in Chicago, Illinois; Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; Cincinnati, Ohio and San Francisco, California. Finally, the theoretical results were compared with experimental data acquired in these cities. A comparison between theoretical flux values and experimental flux values was made using graphical analysis. The conclusion of the experiment is that latitude and longitude influence energy radiation from space and that muon bundle intensity decreases with the increase of the transverse component of the magnetic field in comparison with calculations performed under uniformity of the flux, the effect being enhanced with the increase of the zenith angle.

PROBLEM SOLVING WITH CHAOS
Dominic Yurk
Robert L. Paschal High School, Fort Worth, TX

One of the most prominent and rapidly expanding fields in the past few decades is chaos theory. However, until recently the lack of available computational power has limited physicists’ ability to analyze many systems, including those in which a particle is bounded by electromagnetic fields. The goal of this study was to investigate the chaotic motion of charged particles bounded by various configurations of electric fields by. This was done entirely using computer programs written in the Java programming language. The level of chaos in a system was determined by measuring its Lyapunov number and analyzing its Poincaré surface of section. First, particles were simulated as being bound by charged loops in two dimensions. The effects on chaotic particle motion of changing the shape of the loop, inserting static charges inside the loop, changing the initial conditions of the particle, and particle collisions were investigated. These results were used to conclude that symmetry is the predominant factor in determining whether or not particle motion is chaotic in a given system. Simulations were then conducted in three dimensions to model particle behavior in a tokamak. Both electric and magnetic fields were used to contain the particle, and the applications of an electric field in increasing plasma containment and decreasing chaos in the plasma were investigated. From these simulations it was concluded that electric fields could significantly decrease the level of chaos in plasma motion in a tokamak, possibly leading to a decrease in the frequency of large-scale plasma instabilities.

N-BODY SIMULATION OF SATURN'S RING STRUCTURE
Coleman J. Kendrick
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

The purpose of this project is to determine how the gaps in Saturn’s ring form. Gaps in the ring structure can be formed by: resonances, moons inside the ring, and comet/asteroid impacts. In my simulation model, ring particles are moved around Saturn using Newton’s laws of motion and gravity. The gravity interactions on the ring particles due to 15 of Saturn’s moons are also included. A two-step velocity Verlet method is used to compute the velocities and positions of the particles. A two-step method is necessary to capture the very small moon effects. My simulations have 2 million ring particles, a time step of 1 second, and a 1 hour moon interaction update. I used two Nvidia GTX580s, two AMD HD 5850s, and an AMD HD7970 to complete my simulations. Approximately 8 days were needed to run the simulation on two Nvidia 580s. My main simulation results were able to pick up velocity spikes due to orbital resonances and their locations agreed well with the experimental data, theory and professional simulations. A patch method was developed to increase particle density and capture the effects of the moons without simulating the full ring. I also ran a full 3D ring simulation with the case of a comet impact. The comet in the simulation had the mass of Saturn’s moon Titan. Spikes and waves were formed during impact, and afterwards, they sheared due to the different velocities of ring particles, which formed large spiral waves that extend throughout the whole ring system.

MAKING A MATCHING LAYER FOR ACOUSTIC SENSORS
Justin P. Skycak
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Although the existence of dark matter is supported by strong observational evidence, little is known about its nature. The COUPP (Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics) experiment employs particle collision induced bubble formation in a jar as a means to detect dark matter. COUPP uses lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric acoustic transducers to record bubbles’ acoustic emissions, which are used to discern the particles involved in collisions. However, as COUPP detectors grow larger, acoustic sensors themselves become potential sources of background radiation, so the number of sensors must be minimized. The purpose of this project is to improve the sensitivity of COUPP’s acoustic transducers by creating a matching layer with acoustic impedance between that of the fused silica quartz jar and the PZT in the sensors. Different amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy mixture were used to create cylindrical samples, and the density and speed of sound were measured and used to calculate the acoustic impedance for each sample. A wafer was then cut from the sample with the correct acoustic impedance and tested to see whether it improved sensor sensitivity. Although test results show that the matching layer damped the signal rather than amplifying it, there are several possible explanations for this outcome, and further testing is required.

ANALYSIS OF DRAG REDUCTION FROM AIR IONIZATION DUE TO THE CORONA DISCHARGE EFFECT
Matthew A. Ho
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

This study attempted to examine the effect of a high voltage DC electric field placed over the surface of an object on the force of drag measured acting on the object in a high velocity wind tunnel. It attempted to analyze and determine whether that the drag coefficients of pinewood derby cars would be significantly less when varying high voltage DC electric fields were placed across a retarding feature of their design. The cars were formed in the shape of right trapezoids and were positioned in a wind tunnel suspended by two vertical wires with their flat faces directed to the wind source. A wire anode and a plate cathode were positioned across the top ridge of the removed triangular section. The student researcher hypothesized that a high voltage DC field would provoke a significant electromotive force on the air particles between the electrodes and would reduce the observed drag. The cars were subjected to several strengths of fields, specifically 0 V, 10 kV, and 20 kV. The mass, wire lengths, front face areas, and displacements when subject to the separate levels of independent variables were measured and recorded. Through trigonometric force analysis, the student researcher calculated the force of drag acting on the car and, thus, found the respective drag coefficients of each car under each level of independent variable. Using paired, single-factor ANOVA and t-tests, the student researcher found that there was a significant reduction in the calculated drag coefficients with increasing voltage of the electric fields. This proved that the presence of a high voltage DC electric field does indeed have a significant variable effect on the drag coefficient of an object and can be used to modify the path of air around an object and reduce the observed force of drag.

TIME-RESOLVED OPTICAL STUDY OF THE SURFACE STATES OF TOPOLOGICAL INSULATOR BI2SE3
Connor Everett Tom
John W. North High school, Riverside, CA

The purpose of the experiment was to observe spin-polarized surface electronic states on the topological insulator Bi2Se3. Topological insulators are new materials with surface states that have a unique spin-texture: spins of one polarization travel in only one momentum direction and are topologically protected from backscatter. They may be useful in advanced electronics. Few methods exist for distinguishing the spin-polarized states of the surface from the bulk and for measuring spin lifetime.<br><br> Procedure: Time-resolved second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements were performed on Bi2Se3 single crystals with sample surfaces cleaved by the tape method. Pump and probe pulses of 822 nm and 78 fs duration were obtained from a Ti:Sapphire Kerr-Lens Modelocked oscillator. The pump pulse photoexcited electronic states and the SHG probe signal at 411 nm was measured as a function of pump-probe time delay. SHG was detected because it is a surface specific probe. The Bi2Se3 crystalline x-axis was aligned so opposite spin-polarized surface electrons should contribute opposite sign in the SHG signal.<br><br> Data: Both spin-dependent and spin-independent pump-induced changes were detected in the probe SHG signal. The spin-dependent signal was distinguished by sign reversal under both changes in the probe polarization and pump polarizations as required by theory. The spin-dependent signal peaked at zero time delay and was short with ~40 fs in FWHM time duration. The spin-independent change decreased signal on the 0.5 ps timescale and recovered in ~3 ps.<br><br> Conclusions: The spin-polarized signature of surface states on Bi2Se3 was detected using time-resolved second-harmonic generation. The long-time scale data showed the Fermi Level evolution of the freshly cleaved sample.

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE SHAPE OF PLASMA DISCHARGE IN THE AIR
Michal Dorko, Sasa Havrillova
Gymnazium svateho Tomasa Akvinskeho, Kosice, SLOVAKIA

Electrical discharges are nonequilibrium ionization processes occurring in initially nonionized matter exposed to strong electric fields. The complexity of the electrical discharges is caused by the number of particles, which are contained in discharge, interacting to each other and also with the external field. To understand these fundamental processes there were published many theoretical and experimental studies dealing with the various phases of the discharge formation. Our work is devoted to experimental study of initial stages of the spark discharge. In our project we used Whimshurst’s inductive generator for generating electrical discharges between spherical electrodes. Experimental data were obtained for gaps between electrodes 1 cm to 8 cm in ambient air. To understand fundamental processes of spark discharge we had captured streamer stage on a high-speed video camera and a camera with a fast exposure. From the obtained images, we derive results showing that enlarging the gap between spherical electrodes increases the maximum distance of streamer’s arm from flowline of electrodes. Another important result is that at the images we can clearly distinguish positive and negative streamer according to their characteristic shape. For another experiment we had constructed cloud chamber where we captured the gradual development of electrical discharge from the initial stages of formation until the spark discharge. Slightly before spark the ionization front moves from one electrode to the other, and after reaching electrode the front turns and moves in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is probably related to the formation of so-called back streamer.

A BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF DNA: CAN SALT CHANGE THE SHAPE OF DNA?
Aysha Kinjo Demeler, Blanca Hernandez Uribe
Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how different sodium concentrations affected DNA anisotropy. Because DNA has a negatively charged phosphate backbone which repels itself and other DNA molecules, the DNA cannot coil/bend freely causing it to be stiff and rod-like in any aqueous solution. Two differently sized DNA fragments were placed into 14 different sodium chloride concentrations in order to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA’s phosphate backbone with the positively charged sodium ions, and in turn increasing the flexibility of the DNA. By using an analytical ultracentrifuge, the sedimentation coefficients (or s value) of these DNA samples were measured by sedimentation velocity. The sedimentation coefficient, which is inversely proportional to the DNA’s anisotropy, was found to increase with increasing salt concentration. The change in DNA anisotropy was found to be independent of the length of the DNA molecule; however the amount of change is dependent on DNA fragment length. For example, the small strand of DNA (the 208 bp fragment) only changed in s value from 5.2 to 5.7, whereas the larger plasmid fragment changed from 10.4 to 12 in s value. The greatest change observed occurred in both samples between 0 to 20 mM sodium concentration. It was also found that for sodium concentrations larger than 30 mM the s value of the DNA fragments no longer increased. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that different sodium concentrations do affect DNA anisotropy.

THE STUDY ON THE EFFECTIVE CHIPPING SHAPE OF HANDAXE BY ANALYZING PHYSICAL FRACTURE CHARACTERISTICS
Mi Rim Choi, Ha Young Yun, Oh Reum Cha
Boyoung Girl's High School, Dongdocheon, SOUTH KOREA

Korea Jeongokri handaxes representing Asia’s paleolith era culture feel less technologically developed since their bodies were not completely chipped and left thick compared to European handaxes. Generally, in Asian cultural area, handaxes not completely chipped have been discovered like Jeongok-ri handaxes.<br><br> Currently, archaeological history presumes that this results from the differences of materials. However, this is a limited interpretation that they could not make a perfect form due to the lack of materials, and which might underestimate the Asian handaxe culture without scientific data.<br><br> <br><br> To compare the physical fracture characteristics of the materials used in Jeongokri and European handaxes, a study fusing archaeological chipping analysis and dynamic rock fracture experiment was carried out. For the objectivity of the study, instead of classifying the two kinds of materials, their physical properties were compared to those of the material of micro-blade chipped more thinly than European handaxes (obsidian).<br><br> As a result, the fracture patterns of the main materials used in the two regions showed totally different phases.<br><br> the materials(Quartzite,quartz,tuff)of Jeongokri handaxes showed a pattern of being fractured to the shear (to which cracks are connected) unlike flint used in Europe (with a fracture pattern in surface falling-off type of cracks). Especially, the physical fracture characteristics of obsidian, the target of comparison, also showed a fracture pattern in the surface falling-off type like European flint. <br><br> through an analysis on a phased fracture form ,the chipping shapes were affected by the fracture pattern of the materials rather than technological differences.

A QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL FOR THE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF PROTEIN FOLDING BEHAVIOR
Prithvi Potharaju, Justin Yang
Ardrey Kell High School, Charlotte, NC

The goal of this project was to develop a sophisticated technique for predicting the native state of a protein domain based on the analysis of a large amount of interactions between the constituent atoms and the solvent. Protein folding is a point of focus for researchers today because is determines the functionality of the protein. Also, proteins that do not fold properly either lead to inactivity or even toxic effects such as cancerous growth. The results of this experiment can offer insight into the mechanisms of protein folding and why errors in folding occur. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the dynamics of protein folding sequences. The materials used included a computer, Visual Studios 2010, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The energy states of the protein domain were analyzed at each stage of the folding process to examine how the overall stability of the protein was affected by changes in energy, whether certain levels of energy result in unstable configurations, and to see if an ideal energy state exists that each protein domain tends towards. In order to model this chain of events, various mathematical and physics techniques were applied. These were integrated into a computer program written in JavaScript, which was then run for as much time as necessary for the simulation to be completed. After the data was retrieved, the results were compared with the information for the same protein domain from the Protein Data Bank and analyzed for accuracy.

"V-SHAPED WAVE" GENERATED BY A MOVING OBJECT: ANALYSES AND EXPERIMENTS ON CAPILLARY GRAVITY WAVES
Tomohiko Sato, Takahiro Yomono
Hiroshima Prefectural Fuchu Senior High School, Fuchu-shi, JAPAN

When we put the tip of a stick into water and move it horizontally, a strange surface wave pattern whose angle widens at some point appears on the surface of water. We named this wave pattern “V-shaped wave”. <br><br> There are two kinds of the restoring force of the water surface wave. They are the gravity and the surface tension. The wave pattern caused by gravity behind a ship is known as Kelvin wave. Literatures show the features of Kelvin wave and its equation. The equation is derived by the technical mathematics using integral calculus. We performed analyses and experiments based on the hypothesis that “V-shaped wave” is the wave pattern caused by the surface tension.<br><br> We investigated the features of the wave pattern by the surface tension, using the geometrical method to draw figures of the wave pattern. Moreover, we considered the wave due to the gravity and the surface tension by an analytical mathematics without using integral calculus. Experimental observations on the surface wave pattern and“V-shaped wave” were compared with our analyses. <br><br> According to the figures we drew, the surface tension forms the wave pattern ahead a moving stick, in contrast to the gravity case. It is revealed that “V-shaped wave” is the wave pattern by surface tension which is influenced by the dent of the water surface behind the stick. Finally, we considered the wave pattern by the surface tension, investigating the relation between the theoretical wave pattern and the experimental one formed by moving object.

In the past, rubber planters had to dry and pressed the collected latex into flat sheets and sold by weight. Nowadays, latex can be sold in liquid form. The merchants determine the percentage of dry rubber mass in the latex by special equipment such as metrolac In this project, a simple equipment was designed to help the latex collectors in onsite determination of the rubber mass content and subsequently the approximate price of the latex. The equipment employed the principle of moment of force which was previously reported to be used in accurate determination of liquid density . We hypothesized that the moment of force could also be used to determine rubber mass in latex. In the first step, the densities of several liquids with standard density values were determined with our equipment and compared. The result showed that our values differed from the standard values by 0.57-1.90 %. Thus, this method can be used for accurate determination of liquid density. Then, we used our equipment to determine the densities of latex with different rubber mass contents as determined by metrolac The results showed that fresh latex with higher dry mass content had lower density and the dry mass content obtained by this simple equipment were similar to the values obtained by metrolac. Then we calibrated the scale to read as dry rubber mass so that the latex collectors can directly measure the dry rubber mass content from the equipment. This simple equipment has the advantage over metrolac because it can be used with freshly collected latex while latex has to be processed before being measured by metrolac. In addition, metrolac has to be preset to a specified condition before use. This simple and low cost equipment can help rubber planters to determine the quality and estimate the price of freshly collected latex.

THE SORTATION OF GRANULAR MATERIALS THROUGH FORCED CONVECTION: COMPARING SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT
Seneca Jackson Velling, Zachary Collins
Watchung Hills Regional High School, Warren, NJ

Understanding of the transport of complex fluids, such as granular-gas or droplet-gas mixtures is important for the transport of materials and fuel in both normal and varied gravity environments. We combined a computer simulation and experiment to model the flow of a granular mixture in a pipe. The experimental system consisted of a transparent cylinder containing a mixture of 0.3 - 1.4 mm plastic beads and air. The beads were fluidised by air injected upward. The motion of the bead-air mixture was video recorded at varying air speeds in the range of 0.75 - 1.5 m/s. The air flow was laminar with visible wall drag as per video obtained using smoke sticks. The video analysis using Logger Pro showed distinct sorting by size with the beads in the top ⅓ portion of the mixture 1.4 ± 0.2 times larger than the beads in the lower portion of the container. The video showed the smaller beads circulating in the vertical plane while the top layer of the larger beads remained relatively steady. The tracking of individual beads showed small oscillations in vertical plane at a frequency of 2.4 ± 0.8 Hz. To understand the theoretical basis of the observed motion we ran a computational fluid-dynamics simulation using the GNU OpenFoam package, under Gnu Public License. Using C++ we were able to set airspeed as a variable and to enter the geometry of our experimental system. To be able to run this computationally intensive program in real time we created a computer cluster. The cluster was designed to distribute the processing in parallel through a series of slave nodes. Visualization Tool Kit was used to represent the output files. The results of our simulation support our experimental observations. The use of our simulation to model the pipe-constrained fluidization of grains allows us t

INVESTIGATION OF ANISOTROPIC NEUTRON RADIATION FROM A FARNSWORTH IEC FUSION REACTOR
Jake Jordan Hecla, Raymond Maung, Rian Chandra
Aviation High School, Des Moines, WA

The neutron production from Farnsworth type Inertial Electrostatic Fusion reactors (fusor) was once considered to be spherically symmetric (isotropic) with reference to the central focus. The most widely held belief of a fusor’s function states that the majority of fusion reactions occur in the deuterium plasma in the central grid, implying homogenous neutron radiation referential to this point. The purpose of this research is to test the validity of this belief. The team used neutron sensitive CR39 plastic slides and bubble detectors to test whether or not there is significant anisotropy in the neutron flux from Northwest Nuclear Consortium’s fusor. The dosimeters were exposed to a flux of neutrons(2.45MeV D,n) at a dose rate of ~5 mR/hr for varying time periods. The slides were mounted around the fusor, and the two bubble detectors were placed in various locations around the fusor. Visual and digital analysis of the data corroborate a higher neutron flux at the front and rear of the fusor, and less on the sides and top. These results suggest that other sites of neutron production may exist outside of the central plasma and that current assumptions about a fusor’s functionality may be inaccurate. Because of the novel nature of the research and techniques involved, further experimentation is required. The team recommends rotating the central grid to test explanations for this phenomenon: fusion occurring in the plasma beams, or beam-on-target fusion with embedded deuterium ions.

THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF WATER
Charlyn Castro Manuyag, Fely Marie Magaoay
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI

Refraction of a laser beam in the boundary layer near the surface of a glass containing<br><br>water with different temperature is investigated theoretically and experimentally. An<br><br>experimental setup and typical refraction are described. The effect of temperature on the index of refraction of water is calculated using the proposed geometric-optics model demonstrating the close agreement with experiment. Furthermore, with the research about the comprehension of Snell’s law, this experiment was successful. The relationship between the incidence and refraction are described using the Snell’s law. In this experiment, by having the background knowledge about refraction in mind, it enhanced the results of this project. This project consisted of an immense amount of research, precise experimentation and sharp calculations. The law satisfied in metamaterials, which allow light to be bent “backward” at a negative angle of refraction (negative refractive index). By including the Snell’s law in this experiment, it generally validates the refraction of sharp fronts that can be described in this project.

State Educational Budget Institution Lyceum 1511 at 'National Research Nuclear University 'MEPhI', Moscow, RUSSIA

In the course of the project pure silicon and laboratory glass were deposited by means of a DC magnetron discharge. Coatings obtained on rigid substrates (W, Al) had bad adhesion and had large inner tension. Films deposited on elastic substrates (fluoroplastic) weren’t destroyed by mechanical action, had good adhesion.<br><br>Film structure was investigated by optical and electron microscopes. Two types of formations have been found on film surfaces. The source of first type of formations (silicon droplets 10-70 µm in diameter) is liquid phase of molten silicon. Second type of formations (globes up to 6 µm in diameter) were growing from the film without potential on substrate. Decreasing the speed of deposition prevented formation of silicon droplets and thermal damage of substrates. Films obtained on fluoroplastic had homogeneous structure. Metal substrates were cleaned by glow discharge before sputtering. Fluroplast was situated in shadowed area of cathode. Silicon was deposited on fluoroplastic without prior cleaning of substrates, which makes the technology of deposition simply and effective.

STELLAR SPECTROSCOPY

Leksands Gymnasium, Leksand, SWEDEN

The purpose of this project was to design and construct a spectrograph for the field of astronomy, and to then use it to collect, compile and analyze stellar spectra of the visible light from stars of different spectral classes. With our own instruments and spectrograph, our intentions were to determine how the effective temperatures of targeted stars affect stellar spectra, as well as to study any patterns we may discover.<br><br>The spectrograph was constructed based on our own calculations and was used to collect data from a total of 11 stars, which were selected based on their spectral class, apparent magnitude and altitude above horizon, where stars near zenith where preferred. The functionality of the spectrograph was examined, and the collected spectra were calibrated and compiled for analysis of how peak wavelength and absorption lines are connected to the temperature of the star.<br><br>Our data confirmed that the underlying continuous spectra of all stars matched relatively well the radiation expected from a theoretical blackbody of the same temperature. The absorption lines of different elements were also found to increase in strength with higher temperatures, but only up to a certain point. Instead, above that point, they decreased drastically in intensity, likely due to the ionization of the majority of the atoms.<br><br>Our result, gathered from the obtained spectra, seemed to agree with current models and theories on the subject, although there appeared to be room for improvement regarding the construction of the spectrograph.

APPLYING FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF ELECTRODYNAMICS TO DEVELOP A SIMULATION MODEL FOR VIBRATING SAMPLE MAGNETOMETERS (VSM)
Edward Quan Bao, Martin Kurian
Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, DE

Magnetic nanoparticles intrigue researchers because of their numerous applications. For example, in cancer research, the magnetic properties of these unique particles can be used to heat and destroy tumor cells alone. However, this is only possible if the accurate properties are known for these nanoparticles. The current instrument used to study properties of these particles is the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). The VSM operates by vibrating a sample in an applied magnetic field while two pickup coils register the induced current, translating it into various magnetic properties. A previously unstudied problem associated with using the VSM is error associated with off-centering of the sample. Because of this unknown error, measurements currently taken in the VSM are shrouded in uncertainty. This research focuses on using computer models to simulate the measurements taken in the VSM and to ultimately compute error due to off-centering. To create the model, Maxwell’s Equations – specifically Gauss’ Law for Magnetism and Faraday’s Law of Induction – were used in the MATLAB programming language to simulate the measurements. Findings indicate that the simulation modeled VSM measurements effectively. Also, results demonstrated a drastic alteration of the magnetic properties caused by off-centering errors. It was seen that even the tiniest off-centering, such as only 2mm, can lead to levels of error at 15%. This model now can be applied as an effective and much needed reference for VSM measurements; researchers can have increased confidence of obtaining the correct properties for their samples.

OPTIMIZING OPTICAL SIGNAL QUALITY FOR HIGH ENERGY PARTICLE DETECTION
Michael Tripepi, Samuel Sharkey
Elkhart Memorial High School, Elkhart, IN

Detectors in particle colliders require periodic upgrades to incorporate new technology. This study researched two proposed modifications to the hadron calorimeters: optical mixers and quartz capillary tubes (QCT). These optical mixers, made of plastic fiber optic cables, are used to diffuse the light signal entering the photo-sensors. The purpose of the QCT is to encase wavelength shifting (Y-11) fibers to collect more light from the scintillating panels in a hadron calorimeter and to simplify maintenance. Testing was done in a light tight box, mimicking the setup of a detector using a 400nm LED as a light source. Both the QCT and optical mixers had their light output profiled and transmission tested. Samples were irradiated and tested to prove viability in a high radiation environment. During research, an innovation in the design of the optical mixer was made that resulted in light transmission at consistently higher levels. The QCT tests show that a Y-11 fiber inserted into a QCT and coupled with distilled water has the ability to transmit a significant portion of the signal despite radiation degradation. In addition, it was discovered that the Y-11 fiber anneals over a period of time after irradiation. These results will increase cost efficiency for particle detectors as well as provide new technology for improved data gathering and servicing of equipment; application can also be extended into medical technologies.

INTERACTIVE SPACE MAP SIMULATION: SOLVING N-BODY PROBLEM
Mikolaj Ryszard Nalecz, Piotr Morawiecki
Meridian International School, Warsaw, POLAND

“N-body problem” is a problem with calculating paths of ‘n’celestial bodies, which attract each other because of the gravitation. It is possible to solve in case of only two bodies, but the situation gets more complicated while this number is greater. In this case the bodies paths are impossible to calculate in an way and can be only approximately predicted using the numeric<br><br>method.<br><br>We have created untypical method to solve this problem, in which we have connected the analytic method of solving “two-body problem” with the numeric method. In the last method we need to make lots of calculation in as short time as possible. We wrote a program – “Interactive Space Map Simulation”, based on this method. We combine all the bodies into<br><br>pairs and then the program calculates their position after determined time (for ex. 1 minute), without including the others bodies gravitation. After all possible pairs are calculated, the each bodies changes in position and velocity are summed. The program repeats this algorithm many times to predict the position of planets after any, even very long, time (for ex. 1 year).<br><br>In the project we compare our solution to commonly used, numeric, one and we also show the applications of our simulations: projecting space missions, estimating the chance of collision with asteroids, solving astrophysical hypothesis and finally, education.
